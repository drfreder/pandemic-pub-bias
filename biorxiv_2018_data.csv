This can occur through cell-autonomous mechanisms in individual neurons or through reverberating activity in recurrently connected neural networks. We report a third mechanism involving temporal integration of neural activity by a network of astrocytes. Previously, we showed that some types of interneurons can generate long-lasting trains of action potentials for tens of seconds (\""barrage firing\"") following repeated depolarizing stimuli. Here, we show that calcium signaling in an astrocytic network correlates with barrage firing; that active depolarization of astrocyte networks by chemical or optogenetic stimulation enhances barrage firing; and that chelating internal calcium, inhibiting release from internal stores, or inhibiting GABA transporters or metabotropic glutamate receptors inhibited barrage firing. Thus, through complex molecular processes, networks of interconnected astrocytes influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural networks by directly integrating neural activity and driving long-lasting barrages of action potentials in some populations of inhibitory interneurons.","10.1038/s41467-018-06338-3"

Structures belonging to the TRPV, TRPM, TRPP, TRPA and TRPML subfamilies have been solved, but to date, none of the founding canonical (TRPC) structures. Here we report an electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of TRPC4 in its apo state to an overall resolution of 3.3 [A]. The structure reveals an unusually complex architecture with a long pore loop stabilized by a disulfide bond. Beyond the shared tetrameric six-transmembrane fold, the TRPC4 structure deviates from other TRP channels with a unique cytosolic domain, this unique cytosolic N-terminal domain forms extensive aromatic contacts with the TRP and the C-terminal domains. The comparison of our structure with other known TRP structures provides molecular insights into TRPC4 ion selectivity and extends our knowledge of the diversity and evolution of the TRP channels.","10.1038/s41467-018-05247-9"

Even worse, meticulously assembled flow channels can be used only once for most experiments. A reusable surface would thus dramatically increase productivity and efficiency of single-molecule experiments. In this paper, we report a novel surface reconditioning strategy termed ERASE (Epitaxial Removal Aided by Strand Exchange) that allows a single flow cell to be used for vast repetition of single-molecule experiments. In this method, biomolecules immobilized to the surface through a nucleic acid duplex are liberated when a competing DNA strand disrupts the duplex via toehold-mediated strand displacement. We demonstrate the wide-range applicability of this method with various common surface preparation techniques, fluorescent dyes, and biomolecules including the bacterial ribosome. Beyond time and cost savings, we also show ERASE can assort molecules based on a nucleic acid barcode sequence, thus allowing experiments on different molecules in parallel. Our method increases the utility of prepared surfaces and is a significant improvement to the current single-use paradigm.","10.1093/nar/gky1168"

In animals, kinetochores without attached microtubules expand their outermost layer into crescent and ring shapes to promote microtubule capture and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signalling. Kinetochore expansion is an example of protein co-polymerization, but the mechanism is not understood. Here, we present evidence that kinetochore expansion is driven by oligomerization of the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex, an outer kinetochore component that recruits the motor dynein and the SAC proteins Mad1-Mad2. Depletion of ROD in human cells suppresses kinetochore expansion, as does depletion of Spindly, the adaptor that connects RZZ to dynein, while dynein itself is dispensable. Expansion is also suppressed by mutating ZWILCH residues implicated in Spindly binding. Conversely, supplying cells with excess ROD facilitates kinetochore expansion under otherwise prohibitive conditions. Using the C. elegans early embryo, we demonstrate that ROD-1 has a concentration-dependent propensity for oligomerizing into {micro}m-scale filaments, and we identify the ROD-1 {beta}-propeller as a key regulator of self-assembly. Finally, we show that a minimal ROD-1-Zw10 complex efficiently oligomerizes into filaments in vitro. Our results suggest that RZZs capacity for oligomerization is harnessed by kinetochores to assemble the expanded outermost domain, in which RZZ filaments serve as recruitment platforms for SAC components and microtubule-binding proteins. Thus, we propose that RZZ self-assembly into filaments underlies the adaptive change in kinetochore size that contributes to chromosome segregation fidelity.","10.1016/j.cub.2018.08.056"

However, the complexity and dynamic distribution of tubulin PTMs within cells have hindered the understanding of their physiological roles in specific subcellular compartments. Here we develop a method to rapidly deplete tubulin glutamlyation inside the primary cilia, a microtubule-based sensory organelle protruding on the cell surface, by targeting an engineered deglutamylase to the cilia in minutes. This rapid deglutamylation quickly leads to altered ciliary functions such as kinesin-2-mediated anterograde intraflagellar transport and Hedgehog signaling, along with no apparent crosstalk to other PTMs such as acetylation and detyrosination. Our study offers a feasible approach to spatiotemporally manipulate tubulin PTMs in living cells.

However, little is known about its regulatory roles in gene expression and cell fate determination. Here we show that acidic environment shaped by lactate accumulation promotes the self-renewal and pluripotency of both mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Mechanistically, acidic pH reduces the tri-methylation of H3K27 globally at transcriptional start sites to partially prevent ESC differentiation. In addition, acidic pH stabilizes a large number of mRNAs including pluripotency genes. Furthermore, we found that AGO1 protein is downregulated at acidic conditions, leading to the de-repression of a subset of microRNA targets in low-pH treated ESCs. Altogether, our study provides insights into mechanisms whereby acidic microenvironment produced by enhanced glycolysis regulates gene expression to determine cell fate and has broad implications in the fields of regenerative medicine and cancer biology.","NA"

Fueled by research in a few model systems where phenotypic hybrids are easily identified, research into hybridization and introgression (the flow of genes between species) has exploded with the advent of whole-genome sequencing and emerging methods to detect the signature of hybridization at the whole-genome or chromosome level. Amongst these are a general class of methods that utilize patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a tree as markers of hybridization. These methods have been applied to a variety of genomic systems ranging from butterflies to Neanderthals to detect introgression, however, when employed at a fine genomic scale these methods do not perform well to quantify introgression in small sample windows.\n\nResultsWe introduce a novel method to detect introgression by combining two widely used statistics: pairwise nucleotide diversity dxy and Pattersons D. The resulting statistic, the Basic distance fraction (Bdf), accounts for genetic distance across possible topologies and is designed to simultaneously detect and quantify introgression. We also relate our new method to the recently published fd and incorporate these statistics into the powerful genomics R-package PopGenome, freely available on CRAN. The supplemental material contains a wide range of simulation studies and a detailed manual how to perform the statistics within the PopGenome framework.\n\nConclusionWe present a new distance based statistic Bdf that avoids the pitfalls of Pattersons D when applied to small genomic regions and accurately quantifies the fraction of introgression (f) for a wide range of simulation scenarios.","10.1186/s12859-019-2747-z"

Canonical CRC somatic gene mutations with high prevalence (>10%) have been verified, including TP53, APC, KRAS, SMAD4, FBXW7 and PIK3CA. PEG3 is identified as a novel frequently mutated gene (10.6%). APC and Wnt signaling exhibit significantly lower mutation frequencies than those in TCGA data. Analysis with clinical characteristics indicates that APC gene and Wnt signaling display lower mutation rate in lymph node positive cancer than negative ones, which are not observed in TCGA data. APC gene and Wnt signaling are considered as the key molecule and pathway for colorectal cancer initiation, and these findings greatly undermine their importance in tumor progression for Chinese patients. Taken together, the application of next-generation sequencing has led to the determination of novel somatic mutations and alternative disease mechanisms in colorectal cancer progression, which may be useful for understanding disease mechanism and personalizing treatment for Chinese patients.","10.18632/oncotarget.25287"

Here, we compared the in vitro and in vivo effects of 18:2 on Lactobacillus reuteri and L. johnsonii. Directed evolution in vitro in both species led to strong 18:2 resistance with mutations in genes for lipid biosynthesis, acid stress, and the cell membrane or wall. Small-intestinal Lactobacillus populations in mice were unaffected by chronic and acute 18:2 exposure, yet harbored both 18:2- sensitive and resistant strains.

One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states. The one unifying aspect of both classes is their function of binding ATP. We identified Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers as most compact ATP binding motifs characteristic for each Class. Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures. Regarding the origin of aaRS, the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis states that the peculiar nature of the two aaRS classes is the result of their primordial forms, called Protozymes, being encoded on opposite strands of the same gene. Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes. Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.\n\nAuthor summaryAminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS) are primordial enzymes essential for interpretation and transfer of genetic information. Understanding the origin of the peculiarities observed with aaRS can explain what constituted the earliest life forms and how the genetic code was established. The increasing amount of experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of aaRS opens up new avenues for high-throughput analyses of molecular mechanisms. In this study, we present an exhaustive structural analysis of ATP binding motifs. We unveil an oppositional implementation of enzyme substrate binding in each aaRS Class. While Class I binds via interactions mediated by backbone hydrogen bonds, Class II uses a pair of arginine residues to establish salt bridges to its ATP ligand. We show how nature realized the binding of the same ligand species with completely different mechanisms. In addition, we demonstrate that sequence or even structure analysis for conserved residues may miss important functional aspects which can only be revealed by ligand interaction studies. Additionally, the placement of those key residues in the structure supports a popular hypothesis, which states that prototypic aaRS were once coded on complementary strands of the same gene.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006101"

For ectothermic species with broad geographical distributions, latitudinal/altitudinal variation in environmental temperatures (averages and extremes) are expected to shape the evolution of physiological tolerances and the acclimation capacity (i.e., degree of phenotypic plasticity) of natural populations. This can create geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favour individuals that maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural selection targets this trait in natural populations. Here we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge by measuring survival, through mark recapture integrated into an information-theoretic approach, as a function of the plasticity of critical thermal limits for activity, behavioural thermal preference and the thermal sensitivity of metabolism in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog Pleurodema thaul. Overall, our results indicate that thermal acclimation in this population is not being targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models, survival decreased in individuals with less tolerance to cold when cold-acclimated (probably because daily low extremes are frequent during the cooler periods of the year) and increased with body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates were non-significant.","10.1111/eva.12702"

In the present study, we used a laser-aided isolation technique to investigate the clonal relationship between the primary tumor and tumor spheroids found in the malignant ascites of an EOC patient. Somatic alteration profiles of ovarian cancer-related genes were determined for eight spatially separated samples from primary ovarian tumor tissues and ten tumor spheroids from the malignant ascites using next-generation sequencing.\n\nResultsWe observed high levels of intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) in copy number alterations (CNAs) and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the primary tumor and the tumor spheroids. As a result, we discovered that tumor cells in the primary tissues and the ascites were genetically different lineages. We categorized the CNAs and SNVs into clonal and subclonal alterations according to their distribution among the samples. Also, we identified focal amplifications and deletions in the analyzed samples. For SNVs, a total of 171 somatic mutations were observed, among which 66 were clonal mutations present in both the primary tumor and the ascites, and 61 and 44 of the SNVs were subclonal mutations present in only the primary tumor or the ascites, respectively.\n\nConclusionsBased on the somatic alteration profiles, we constructed phylogenetic trees and inferred the evolutionary history of tumor cells in the patient.

Glutamatergic excitability and regulation of TrkB neurotrophin receptor and GSK3{beta} (glycogen synthase kinase 3{beta}) signaling are considered as molecular-level determinants for ketamines antidepressant effects. Recent clinical observations suggests that nitrous oxide (N2O, \""laughing gas\""), another NMDA-R blocking dissociative anesthestic, also produces rapid antidepressant effects but the underlying mechanisms remain essentially unstudied. In this animal study we show that N2O, with a clinically relevant dosing regimen, evokes an emergence of rebound slow EEG (electroencephalogram) oscillations, a phenomenon considered to predict the efficacy and onset-of-action ECT. Very similar rebound slow oscillations are induced by subanesthetic ketamine and flurothyl (a treatment analogous to ECT). These responses become best evident upon drug withdrawal, i.e. after the peak of acute pharmacological actions, when their most prominent effects on cortical excitability have subsided. Most importantly, TrkB and GSK3{beta} signaling remain unchanged during N2O administration (ongoing NMDA-R blockade) but emerge gradually upon gas withdrawal along with increased slow EEG oscillations.

Under a range of conditions and in all trajectories examined, TOGs are initially captured and oriented by tubulin at high radius so that their basic loops faced inwards towards the tubulin. Thereafter, the loops continue to face inwards towards the tubulin and to scan its surface until stereospecific docking the crystallographic binding site occurs. We find that the acidic C-terminal tails of tubulin are not required for electrostatic steering, but instead serve to widen the acceptance angles for electrostatically steered diffusion-to-capture. All-atom normal mode analysis indicates that TOGs are remarkably stiff, enabling them to drive free GTP-tubulin into a partially-curved state by conformational selection. Electrostatic free energy calculations show that the complex that each TOG makes with its cognate tubulin is stable. Our work argues that TOGs accelerate microtubule plus end growth by two complementary electrostatic mechanisms, first by electrostatically steered diffusion-to-capture, and second by electrostatic stabilisation of a partially bent conformation of GTP-tubulin that exchanges rapidly into the tip-lattice. To explain this rapid exchange, we propose a model in which simultaneous binding of the GTP-tubulin to the TOG and the microtubule tip-lattice can occur and is required to de-stabilise the crystallographic complex and release and recycle the TOG.\n\nAuthor SummaryTOG domain microtubule polymerases are protein machines that accelerate the growth of microtubule plus ends by capturing tubulin building blocks from solution and feeding them into the growing microtubule tip. Exactly how TOGs manage to do this remains unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest that electrostatic interactions play a key role, but the detailed role of electrostatics in the polymerase mechanism of TOGs is so far little explored. Here using linked computational approaches we analyse the electrostatic fields of TOGs from the TOG polymerase superfamily and simulate their tubulin binding trajectories. We find that each TOG domain has a shaped electrostatic field that is precisely matched to its tubulin binding partner, such that each TOG is electrostatically orientated at high radius and thereafter electrostatically guided to its capture site. Our work shows that electrostatic steering dramatically accelerates the diffusion-to-capture of tubulin by TOGs. The resulting TOG-tubulin complexes are electrostatically stabilized and we suggest that release of the TOG from this complex requires that tubulin first be incorporated into the growing microtubule, thereby being driven into a TOG-incompatible conformation.","NA"

Establishing a pathophysiological model that accounts for both heterogeneity and phenotypic similarity is essential to inform stratified treatment approaches. In this cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study, we recruited 77 healthy controls (HC), and 71 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (SCZ), and reconstructed the structural connectivity of 90 brain regions covering entire cerebral cortex. We first confirmed the heterogeneity in structural connectivity by showing a reduced inter-individual similarity in SCZ compared with HC. Moreover, we found it was not possible to cluster patients into subgroups with shared patterns of dysconnectivity, indicating a high degree of mechanistic divergence in schizophrenia. Instead of the strength of connectivity between any particular brain regions, we investigated the diversity (or statistically, the variance) of the topographic distribution of the strength was reduced. HC had higher topographic diversity in whole brain structural connectivity compared to the patient group\n\n(P = 2 x 10-6, T = 4.96, Cohen'S d = 0.87). In 62 of the 90 brain regions, the topographic diversity was significantly reduced in patients compared to controls after FDR correction (<0.05). When topographic diversity was used as a discriminant feature for classification between patients and controls, we significantly (P = 4.29 x 10-24) improved the classification accuracy to 79.6% (sensitivity 78.3%, specificity 81.3%). This finding suggests highly individualized pattern of structural dysconnectivity underlying the heterogeneity of schizophrenia converges to a convergent common pathway as reduced topographic diversity for the clinical construct of the disease.","10.1016/j.schres.2019.10.034"

Using time resolved fluorescence, NMR and molecular dynamics we show for the first time that soluble Cse4 can exist in a  closed conformation, inaccessible to various regulatory components. We further determined that binding of its obligate partner H4, alters the inter-domain interaction within Cse4, ensuring an  open state that will lend itself to proteolysis. This dynamic model allows kinetochore formation only in presence of H4, as the N-terminus, which is required for interaction with centromeric components will be unavailable in absence of H4. The specific requirement of H4 binding for the conformational regulation of Cse4 suggests a unique structure-based regulatory mechanism for Cse4 localization and prevention of premature kinetochore assembly.","NA"

We evaluated the microhabitat heterogeneity through multivariate statistics, using onto 23 habitat variables for vertical-horizontal habitat structure along pluvial seasons. To detect specific microdistribution changes and habitat preferences by two species of small mammals, we used second order spatial statistics and general linear models. According to their respective morphology and locomotive adaptations, the middle sized, midscansorial P. difficilis was resident all year long and preferred microhabitats with a high log ground cover, while the opportunistic, small sized, cursorial P. melanotis changed its occupancy area, depending on density of herbaceous and woody plants cover. Under the more benign microhabitat conditions of rainy season (denser plant coverage, milder temperature), both species showed closer microdistribution patterns; while these became repulsive at the less benign conditions of dry season (scarcer plant cover, colder temperature). Thus, we could confirm that seasonal changes of microhabitat heterogeneity promoted Peromyscus coexistence, through dispersion patterns reflecting partition of microhabitat resources.","NA"

We therefore characterised the initiation of gene transcription in the spiny mouse embryo and compared the pattern of gene expression during the embryonic genome activation (EGA) with common mouse and human embryos. Naturally-mated spiny mouse embryos were obtained at the 2-cell, 4-cell and 8-cell stages of development (n=4 biological replicates per stage). RNA-Seq of these samples produced 709.1M paired-end reads in total. De novo assembly of reads was conducted using Trinity. Embryo-specific transcripts were extracted from the de novo assembly and added to the reference spiny mouse transcriptome. Transcription was first detected between the 2-cell and 4-cell stages for the majority of genes (n=3,428), with fewer genes first transcribed between the 4-cell and 8-cell stages (n=1,150).

This late stage response was initiated by oxidative stress and Myc. It was driven via a JNK - IFN{beta} - PKR feed-forward circuit locking the susceptible macrophages in a state of escalating stress. Consequently, prolonged TNF stimulation of the susceptible macrophages reduced their resilience to subsequent infection with intracellular bacteria.\n\nThe data support a generalizable paradigm in host - pathogen interactions, where susceptibility emerges gradually within inflammatory tissue due to imbalanced macrophage responses to growth, differentiation, activation and stress stimuli prior to encountering pathogens.

Here we have used nasal curette biopsies from a serotype 6B Experimental Human Pneumococcal Carriage Model (EHPC) to visualize S. pneumoniae colonisation and relate these interactions to epithelial surface marker expression and transcriptomic profile upregulation. We have used a Detroit 562 cell co-culture model to further understand these processes and develop an integrated epithelial transcriptomic module to interrogate gene expression in the EHPC model. We have shown for the first time that pneumococcal colonisation in humans is characterised by microcolony formation at the epithelial surface, microinvasion, cell junction protein association, epithelial sensing, and both epithelial endocytosis and paracellular transmigration. Comparisons with other clinical strains in vitro has revealed that the degree of pneumococcal epithelial surface adherence and microinvasion determines the host cell surface marker expression (ICAM-1 and CD107), cytokine production (IL-6, IL-8 and ICAM-1) and the transcriptomic response. In the context of retained barrier function, epithelial microinvasion is associated with the upregulation of a wide range of epithelial innate signalling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, cellular metabolism and stress response genes. The prominence of epithelial TLR4R signalling pathways implicates pneumolysin, a key virulence factor, but although pneumolysin gene deletion partially ameliorates the inflammatory transcriptional response in vitro, critical inflammatory pathways persist in association with enhanced epithelial adhesion and microinvasion. Importantly, the pattern of the host-bacterial interaction seen with the 6B strain in vitro is also reflected in the EHPC model, with evidence of microinvasion and a relatively silent epithelial transcriptomic profile that becomes most prominent around the time of bacterial clearance.

Although comparative genomic studies reveal large-scale turnover of enhancers, a specific understanding of the molecular steps by which mammalian or primate enhancers evolve remains elusive.\n\nResultsWe identified candidate hominoid-specific liver enhancers from H3K27ac ChIP-seq data. After locating orthologs in 11 primates spanning [~]40 million years, we synthesized all orthologs as well as computational reconstructions of 9 ancestral sequences for 348 \""active tiles\"" of 233 putative enhancers. We concurrently tested all sequences (20 per tile) for regulatory activity with STARR-seq in HepG2 cells, with the goal of characterizing the evolutionary-functional trajectories of each enhancer. We observe groups of enhancer tiles with coherent trajectories, most of which can be explained by one or two mutational events per tile. We quantify the correlation between the number of mutations along a branch and the magnitude of change in functional activity. Finally, we identify 57 mutations that correlate with functional changes; these are enriched for cytosine deamination events within CpGs, compared to background events.\n\nConclusionsWe characterized the evolutionary-functional trajectories of hundreds of liver enhancers throughout the primate phylogeny.

Furthermore, we present experimental evidence that two nucleation mechanisms control spontaneous Ex1Q49 fibrillogenesis: (1) a relatively slow primary fibril-independent nucleation process, which involves the spontaneous formation of aggregation-competent fibrillary structures, and (2) a fast secondary fibril-dependent nucleation process, which involves nucleated branching and promotes the rapid assembly of highly complex fibril bundles with multiple ends. The proposed aggregation mechanism is supported by studies with the small molecule O4, which perturbs early events in the aggregation cascade and delays Ex1Q49 fibril assembly, comprehensive mathematical and computational modelling studies, and seeding experiments with small, preformed fibrillar Ex1Q49 aggregates that promote the assembly of amyloid fibrils. Together, our results suggest that nucleated branching in vitro plays a critical role in the formation of complex fibrillar HTT exon-1 aggregates with multiple ends.","10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.017"

Here we examined the relative role of schema-consistent temporal structure and arbitrary but consistent temporal structure on the human posterior medial network. We tested whether, with repeated viewing, the network becomes engaged by scrambled movies with temporal structure. Replicating prior studies, posterior medial regions were immediately locked to stimulus structure upon exposure to intact but not scrambled movies. However, for temporally structured scrambled movies, functional coupling within the network increased across stimulus repetitions, rising to the level of intact movies. Thus, temporal structure is a key determinant of network dynamics and function.","10.1162/jocn_a_01308"

Little is known about the composition, organization and regulation of deuterosomes. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that human deuterosome-stage MCCs are characterized by the expression of many cell cycle-related genes. We further investigated the uncharacterized vertebrate-specific cell division cycle 20B (CDC20B) gene, the host gene of microRNA-449abc. We show that the CDC20B protein associates to deuterosomes and is required for the release of centrioles and the subsequent production of cilia in mouse and Xenopus MCCs. CDC20B interacts with PLK1, which has been shown to coordinate centriole disengagement with the protease Separase in mitotic cells. Strikingly, over-expression of Separase rescued centriole disengagement and cilia production in CDC20B-deficient MCCs. This work reveals the shaping of a new biological function, deuterosome-mediated centriole production in vertebrate MCCs, by adaptation of canonical and recently evolved cell cycle-related molecules.","10.1038/s41467-018-06768-z"

To investigate the contribution of A-fiber nociceptors to secondary hyperalgesia the present study assessed if the perception and brain responses elicited by low-intensity intra-epidermal electrical stimulation (IES), a method preferentially activating A{delta}-fiber nociceptors, are increased in the area of secondary hyperalgesia. HFS was delivered to one of the two forearms of seventeen healthy volunteers. Mechanical pinprick stimulation and IES were delivered at both arms before HFS (T0), 20 minutes after HFS (T1) and 45 minutes after HFS (T2). In all participants, HFS induced an increase in pinprick perception at the HFS-treated arm, adjacent to the site of HFS. This increase was significant at both T1 and T2. HFS did not affect the percept elicited by IES, but did enhance the magnitude of the N2 wave of IES-evoked brain potentials, both at T1 and at T2. HFS induced a long-lasting enhancement of the N2 wave elicited by IES in the area of secondary hyperalgesia, indicating that HFS enhances the responsiveness of the central nervous system to nociceptive inputs conveyed by AMH-II nociceptors.

IgG (under)galactosylation is a promising biomarker to assess disease severity, and monitor and adjust therapy. However, this biomarker has not been implemented in routine clinical chemistry due to a complex analytical procedure that necessitates IgG purification, which is difficult to perform and validate at high throughput.\n\nWe addressed this issue by using endo-{beta}-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Streptococcus pyogenes (endoS) to specifically release Fc N-glycans in whole serum. The entire assay can be completed in a few hours and only entails adding endoS and labeling the glycans with APTS. Glycans are then readily analyzed through capillary electrophoresis. We demonstrate in two independent patient cohorts that IgG undergalactosylation levels obtained with this assay correlate very well with scores calculated from PNGaseF-released glycans of purified antibodies.

We studied whether auditory predictions are sharply tuned to even carry tonotopic specific information. For this purpose, we conducted a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment in which participants passively listened to sound sequences that varied in their regularity (i.e. entropy). Sound presentations were temporally predictable (3 Hz rate), but were occasionally omitted. Training classifiers on the random (high entropy) sound sequence and applying them to all conditions in a time-generalized manner, allowed us to assess whether and how carrier frequency specific information in the MEG signal is modulated according to the entropy level.

Recent theoretical and empirical work has proposed that large microbial communities may exhibit an emergent cohesiveness, as a result of collective consumer-resource interactions and metabolic feedbacks between microbial growth and the environment. A fundamental prediction of this proposal is the presence of ecological co-selection during community coalescence, where the invasion success of a given taxon is determined by its community members. To establish the generality of this prediction in experimental microbiomes, we have performed over one hundred invasion and coalescence experiments with environmental communities of different origins that had spontaneously and stably assembled in two different synthetic aerobic environments. We show that the dominant species of the coalesced communities can both recruit their community members (top-down co-selection) and be recruited by them (bottom-up co-selection) into the coalesced communities. Our results provide direct evidence that collective invasions generically produce ecological co-selection of interacting species, emphasizing the importance of community-level interactions during microbial community assembly.","NA"

We introduce a novel best prediction (BP) approach for the additive genomic variance in both the current and the base population in the framework of genomic prediction using the gBLUP-method. The resulting best predictor is the conditional (or posterior) expectation of the additive genomic variance when using the additional information given by the phenotypic data, and is structurally in accordance with the genomic equivalent of the classical additive genetic variance in random-effects models. In particular, the best predictor includes the contribution of (marker) linkage disequilibrium to the additive genomic variance and eliminates the missing contribution of LD that is caused by the assumptions of statistical frameworks such as the random-effects model.

Here, we have examined the immune-stimulatory properties of different variants of guide RNAs (gRNAs) - in vitro transcribed gRNA (IVT-gRNA) and synthetic gRNAs with or without chemical modifications, full-length or duplexed. We find that only IVT-gRNA evokes strong expression of cytokines in a panel of cell lines while all the synthetic RNAs do not. We further find that sensing of IVT-gRNA proceeds mainly through the RIG-I/MAVS RNA sensing axis. One potential use of CRISPR is for antiviral therapy. The antiviral actions of the gRNA tested up until now have been relying purely on the gene editing function of the CRISPR machinery, which weakens its feasibility due to the difficulty to target all infected cells. When IVT-gRNA was combined with unmodified Cas9 mRNA, which also induces cytokine expression, strong immune response was obtained while maintaining nuclease activity of CRISPR. Remarkably, such combination inhibited herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) replication even though the nuclease activity was modest, and provided  bystander protection to the cells that were not transfected with CRIPSR molecules. The antiviral activity of IVT-gRNA was also observed in vivo in HSV-1-infected Cas9+ mice, thus demonstrating the therapeutic potential.

Earlier, we showed that mDiaphanous1, an effector of adhesion-dependent RhoA-signalling promotes MyoD expression in myoblasts, linking contractility to lineage determination. Here, we report that paradoxically, mDia1 negatively regulates MyoD function in myotubes. Knockdown of endogenous mDia1 during differentiation enhances MyoD and Myogenin expression, while over-expression of mDia1{Delta}N3, a RhoA-independent mutant, suppresses Myogenin promoter activity and expression. We investigated mechanisms that may counteract mDia1 to promote Myogenin expression and timely differentiation by analysing mDia1-interacting proteins. We report that mDia1 has a stage-specific interactome, including Prohibitin2, MyoD, Akt2, and {beta}-Catenin, of which Prohibitin2 colocalises with mDia1 in cytoplasmic punctae and opposes mDia1 function in myotubes. Co-expression of mDia1-binding domains of Prohibitin2 reverses the anti-myogenic effects of mDia1{Delta}N3. Our results suggest that Prohibitin2 sequesters mDiaphanous1 to dampen its activity and finetune RhoA-mDiaphanous1 signalling to promote differentiation. Overall, we report that mDia1 is multi-functional signaling effector with opposing functions in different cellular stages, but is modulated by a differentiation-dependent interactome.\n\nSummary statementmDia1 has common and stage-specific functions in muscle cells. In myotubes, mDia1 is sequestered by an interacting protein Prohibitin2, which promotes Myogenin expression and mitigates mDia1s inhibitory effects on differentiation.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=119 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/283044v1_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b1578eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eb6b13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c2c913org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f1f9c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","10.1038/s41598-019-44749-4"

Direct comparison to conventional pronuclear injection demonstrates significantly reduced physical damage and thus improved embryo development with successful genome editing in up to 100% of living offspring.

These findings suggest that such preferences are stable traits with common neural substrates. We hypothesized instead that animals tailor their preferences to subtle changes in task contexts, making risk attitudes flexible. Previous studies used a limited number of outcomes, trial types, and contexts. To gain a broader perspective, we examined two large datasets of male macaques risky choices: one from a task with real (juice) gains and another from a token task with gains and losses. In contrast to previous findings, monkeys were risk-seeking for both gains and losses (i.e. lacked a reflection effect) and showed steeper gain than loss curves (loss-seeking). Utility curves for gains were substantially different in the two tasks. Monkeys showed nearly linear probability weightings in one task and S-shaped ones in the other; neither task produced a consistent inverse-S-shaped curve. To account for these observations, we developed and tested various computational models of the processes involved in the construction of reward value. We found that adaptive differential weighting of prospective gamble outcomes could partially account for the observed differences in the utility functions across the two experiments and thus, provide a plausible mechanism underlying flexible risk attitudes. Together, our results support the idea that risky choices are flexibly constructed at the time of elicitation and place important constraints on neural models of economic choice.","10.1523/jneurosci.2260-17.2018"

Animal models indicate that this process is neurally underpinned by a shift in ventral to dorsal striatal control of behavior, however this shift has not been directly examined in humans. Against this background the present resting state fMRI study employed a two-step approach to (1) precisely map striatal alterations using a novel, data-driven network classification strategy combining Intrinsic Connectivity Contrast (ICC) with Multivoxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) and, (2) to determine whether a ventral to dorsal striatal shift in connectivity with reward and and regulatory control regions can be observed in abstinent (28 days) male cannabis-dependent individuals (n = 24) relative to matched controls (n = 28). Network classification revealed that the groups can be reliably discriminated by global connectivity profiles of two striatal regions that mapped onto the ventral (nucleus accumbens) and dorsal striatum (caudate). Subsequent functional connectivity analysis demonstrated a relative shift between ventral and dorsal striatal communication with fronto-limbic regions that have been consistently involved in reward processing (rostral ACC) and executive / regulatory functions (dorsomedial PFC). Specifically, in the cannabis dependent subjects connectivity between the ventral striatum with the rostral ACC increased, whereas both striatal regions were uncoupled from the regulatory dorsomedial PFC. Together these findings suggest a shift in the balance between dorsal and ventral striatal control in cannabis dependence. Similar changes have been observed in animal models and may promote the loss of control central to addictive behavior.","NA"

However, the principles by which these groups are organized to encode information remain poorly understood. A leading hypothesis is that similarly tuned pyramidal cells that preferentially connect to each other may form multi-cellular encoding units yoked to a similar purpose. The existence of such groups would be reflected on the profile of spontaneous events observed in neocortical networks. We used 2-photon calcium imaging to study spontaneous population-burst events in layer 2/3 of mouse area V1 during postnatal maturation (postnatal day 8-52). Throughout the period examined both size and duration of spontaneously occurring population-bursts formed scale-free distributions obeying a power law. The same was true for the degree of \""functional connectivity,\"" a measure of pairwise synchrony across cells. These observations are consistent with a hierarchical small-world-net architecture, characterized by groups of cells with high local connectivity (\""small worlds\"", cliques) connected to each other via a restricted number of \""hub\"" cells\"" (Bonifazi et al., 2009, Sporns, 2011, Luce & Perry, 1949). To identify candidate \""small world\"" groups we searched for cells whose calcium events had a consistent temporal relationship to events recorded from local inhibitory interneurons. This was guided by the intuition that groups of neurons whose synchronous firing represents a \""temporally coherent computational unit\"" (or feature) ought to be inhibited together. This strategy allowed us to identify clusters of pyramidal neurons whose firing is temporally \""linked\"" to one or more local interneurons. These \""small-world\"" clusters did not remain static, during postnatal development: both cluster size and overlap with other clusters decreased over time as pyramidal neurons became progressively more selective, \""linking\"" to fewer neighboring interneurons. Notably, pyramidal neurons in a cluster show higher tuning function similarity than expected with each other and with their \""linked\"" interneurons. Our findings suggest that spontaneous population events in the visual cortex are shaped by \""small-world\"" networks of pyramidal neurons that share functional properties and work in concert with one or more local interneurons. We argue that such groups represent a fundamental neocortical unit of computation at the population level.","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2275-18.2019"

Recently, Mainland et al. [Sci. data, (2015) 2:sdata20152] have measured {gtrsim} 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics [J. Phys. Chem. B (2017) 121, 1304-1311], we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC50, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006175"

In addition, most well-established bioinformatics tools for DNA metabarcoding were originally 10 designed for short reads and are therefore not suitable. Here we used Pacifc Biosciences circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to DNA-metabarcode environmental samples using a ca. 4,500 bp marker that included most of the eukaryote ribosomal SSU and LSU rRNA genes and the ITS spacer region. We developed a long-read analysis pipeline that reduced error rates to levels 15 comparable to short-read platforms.

During transport, conformational changes that switch accessibility of substrate and ion binding sites from one side of the membrane to the other must be controlled so as to prevent uncoupled movement of ions or substrates. In the Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporter (NSS) family, Na+ stabilizes the transporter in an outward-open state, thus decreasing the likelihood of uncoupled Na+ transport. In a step essential for coupled transport, substrate binding must overcome the effect of Na+, allowing intracellular substrate and Na+ release from an inward-open state. However, it is unclear which specific elements of the protein mediate this conformational response to substrate binding. Previously, we showed that in the prokaryotic NSS transporter LeuT, the effect of Na+ on conformation occurs at the Na2 site, where it influences conformation by fostering interaction between two domains of the protein (JBC 291: 1456, 2016). Here, we identify a conserved tyrosine residue in the substrate binding site required for substrate to enable conversion to inward-open states by establishing an interaction between the two transporter domains. We further identify additional interactions between the two transporter domains in the extracellular pathway that are required. Together with our previous work on the conformational effect of Na+, these results identify mechanistic components underlying ion-substrate coupling in NSS transporters.","10.1073/pnas.1716870115"

First, we use one of the variable importance measures generated by the random forests classification algorithm as a metric to rank genes. Second, we define the EPS (extreme pseudo-samples) pipeline, making use of VAEs (Variational Autoencoders) and regressors to extract a ranking of genes while leveraging the feature space of both virtual and comparable samples.\n\nWe show that, on 12 cancer RNA-Seq data sets ranging from 323 to 1210 samples, using either a random forests based gene selection method or the EPS pipeline outperforms differential expression analysis for 9 and 8 out of the 12 datasets respectively, in terms of identifying subsets of genes associated with survival.\n\nThese results demonstrate the potential of supervised learning-based gene selection methods in RNA-Seq studies and highlight the need to use such multivariate gene selection methods alongside the widely used differential expression analysis.","10.3389/fgene.2018.00297"

We investigated the degree to which meaning versus image salience predicted human viewers spatial distribution of attention over scenes, with attention operationalized as duration-weighted fixation density. The results showed that both meaning and salience predicted the distribution of attention, but that when the correlation between meaning and salience was statistically controlled, meaning accounted for unique variance in attention but salience did not. This pattern was observed for early as well as late fixations, for fixations following short as well as long saccades, and for fixations including or excluding the centers of the scenes.

Here we show in planarians that modulations to body-wide patterning systems shift the target site for eye regeneration while still enabling homeostasis of eyes outside this region. The uncoupling of homeostasis and regeneration, which can occur during normal positional rescaling after axis truncation, is not due to altered injury signaling or stem cell activity, nor specific to eye tissue. Rather, pre-existing tissues, which are misaligned with patterning factor expression domains, compete with properly located organs for incorporation of migratory progenitors. These observations suggest that patterning factors determine sites of organ regeneration but do not solely determine the location of tissue homeostasis. These properties provide candidate explanations for how regeneration integrates pre-existing tissues and how regenerative abilities could be lost in evolution or development without eliminating long-term tissue maintenance and repair.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHomeostatic tissue maintenance can occur independent of precise positional information in planarians.","10.7554/elife.33680"

The mechanism by which CSD enhances the activity and mechanosensitivity of meningeal afferents remains poorly understood, but may involve cortical metabolic perturbations. We employed extracellular single-unit recording of meningeal afferent activity and monitored changes in cortical blood flow and tissue partial pressure of oxygen (tpO2) in anesthetized male rats to test whether the prolonged cortical hypoperfusion and reduction in tissue oxygenation that occur in the wake of CSD contribute to meningeal nociception. Suppression of CSD-evoked cortical hypoperfusion with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor naproxen blocked the reduction in cortical tpO2, but had no effect on the activation of meningeal afferents. Naproxen, however, distinctly prevented CSD-induced afferent mechanical sensitization. Counteracting the CSD-evoked persistent hypoperfusion and reduced tpO2 by preemptively increasing cortical blood flow using the K(ATP) channel opener levcromakalim did not inhibit the sensitization of meningeal afferents, but prevented their activation. Our data show that the cortical hypoperfusion and reduction in tpO2 that occur in the wake of CSD can be dissociated from the activation and mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferent responses suggesting that the metabolic changes do not contribute directly to these neuronal nociceptive responses.\n\nSignificance statementCSD-evoked activation and mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents is thought to mediate the headache phase in migraine with aura. We report that blocking the CSD-evoked cortical hypoperfusion and reduced tpO2 by cyclooxygenase inhibition is associated with the inhibition of the afferent sensitization but not their activation. Normalization of these CSD-evoked metabolic perturbations by activating K(ATP) channels is, however, associated with the inhibition of afferent activation but not sensitization. These results question the contribution of cortical metabolic perturbations to the triggering mechanism underlying meningeal nociception and the ensuing headache in migraine with aura, further point to distinct mechanisms underlying the activation and sensitization of meningeal afferents in migraine and highlight the need to target both processes for an effective migraine therapy.","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0115-18.2018"

Using the hidden and cued platform variants of the Morris water task, a longitudinal assessment of spatial navigation was conducted on TgF344-AD (n=16) and Fischer 344 (n=12) male and female rats at three age ranges: 4 to 5 months, 7 to 8, and 10 to 11 months of age. TgF344-AD rats exhibited largely intact navigation at 4-5 and 7-8 months of age, with deficits in the hidden platform task emerging at 10-11 months of age. In general, TgF344-AD rats displayed less accurate swim trajectories to the platform and a wider search area around the platform region compared to wildtype rats. Impaired navigation occurred in the absence of deficits in acquiring the procedural task demands or navigation to the cued platform location.

We present an in-depth analysis of 178 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella strains, with a high background diversity and two dominant lineages, as well as several equally resistant lineages with less prevalence. Neither the overall resistance profile nor the virulence factors explain the prevalence of some lineages; we observe several putative hypervirulence factors across the population, including a reduced virulence plasmid, but this does not correlate with expansion of one or few highly virulent and resistant lineages. Phenotypic analysis of the profiles of resistance traits shows that the vast majority of the phenotypic resistance profiles can be explained by detailed genetic analyses. The main discrepancies are observed for beta-lactams combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors, where most, but not all, resistant strains carry a carbapenemase or ampC. Complete genomes for six selected strains, including three of the 21 carbapenem-resistant ones, are reported, which give detailed insights into the early evolution of the bla-NDM-1 enzyme, a carbapenemase that was first reported in 2009 and is now globally distributed. Whole-genome based high-resolution analyses of the dominant lineages suggests a very dynamic picture of gene transfer and selection, with phenotypic changes due to plasmid acquisition and chromosomal changes, and emphasize the need to monitor the bacteria at high resolution to understand the rise of high-risk clones, which cannot be explained by obvious differences in resistance profiles or virulence factors.\n\nImportanceCarbapenem-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) carrying Enterobacteriaceae were recently highlighted as critical priority fo the development of new treatments by the WHO. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae and has seen a dramatic rise in clinical relevance due to its uncanny ability to accumulate multidrug-resistance plasmids. We present a detailed analysis of a set of ESBL-resistant K. pneumoniae clinical isolates, and our high-resolution whole-genome sequence analyses highlight that acquisition of drug resistances is not a one-way street in K. pneumoniae, but a highly dynamic process of gain and loss, and that the most successful lineages in the clinic are not necessarily the most resistant or most virulent ones. Analysis of the virulence potential also shows that these strains harbour some, but not all, hallmarks of hypervirulent strains, emphasizing that it is not a clear distinction between hypervirulent and other strains, but equally in flux.","10.1038/s41598-019-38943-7"

In a classroom setting, we attempted to assess the contribution of specific tissues to polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthesis using currently available tissue-specific RNAi strains. We discovered that rde-1 (ne219), a commonly used RNAi-resistant mutant strain, retains considerable RNAi capacity against RNAi directed at PUFA synthesis genes. Using GC/MS, we measured changes in the fatty acid products of the desaturase enzymes that synthesize PUFAs in a gene dosage sensitive manner. With this method, we tested a panel of previously described RNAi-deficient mutant strains, and found that almost all of them retained a certain degree of RNAi capacity. Importantly, we found that the before mentioned strain, rde-1 (ne219) and the reported germline only RNAi strain, rrf-1 (pk1417) are not appropriate genetic backgrounds for tissue-specific RNAi experiments. However, the knockout mutant rde-1 (ne300) was strongly resistant to dsRNA induced RNAi, and may be appropriate for construction of robust tissue-specific RNAi strains.","NA"

Mutations in CHIP are the driver of spinocerebellar autosomal recessive 16 (SCAR16), or cerebellar CHIPopathy, as we initially discovered this disease was caused by a loss of CHIP ubiquitin ligase function. The initial mutation describing SCAR16 was a missense mutation in the ubiquitin ligase domain of CHIP (p.T246M). Using multiple biophysical and cellular approaches, we demonstrate that T246M mutation results in structural disorganization and misfolding of the CHIP U-box domain, promoting oligomerization, and increased proteasome-dependent turnover. CHIP-T246M has no ligase activity, but maintains interactions with chaperones and alters the co-chaperone function of CHIP. To establish preclinical models of SCAR16, we engineered T246M at the endogenous locus in both mice and rats. Animals homozygous for T246M had both cognitive and motor cerebellar dysfunction distinct from those observed in the CHIP null animal model, as well as deficits in learning and memory, reflective of the cognitive deficits reported in SCAR16 patients. We conclude that the T246M mutation is not equivalent to the total loss of CHIP, supporting the concept that disease-causing CHIP mutations have different biophysical and functional repercussions on CHIP function that may directly correlate to the spectrum of clinical phenotypes observed in SCAR16 patients. Our findings both further expand our basic understanding of CHIP biology and provide meaningful mechanistic insight underlying the molecular drivers of SCAR16 disease pathology, which may be used to inform the development of novel therapeutics for this devastating disease.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007664"

Method 1 utilised a network of small protected areas around known spawning sites. It was the least resilient to change with only 3.9% of post-quake habitat remaining protected in the worst performing scenario. Method 2, based on mapped reaches of potential habitat, remained effective in one catchment (98%) but not in the other (52.5%). Method 3, based on a habitat model, achieved near 100% protection in both catchments but used planning areas far larger than the area of habitat actually used. This example illustrates resilience considerations for protected area design. Redundancy can help maintain effectiveness in face of dynamics and may be a pragmatic choice if planning area boundaries lack in-built adaptive capacity or require lengthy processes for amendment. However, an adaptive planning area coupled with monitoring offers high effectiveness from a smaller protected area. Incorporating elements of both strategies provides a promising conceptual basis for adaptation to major perturbations or responding to slow change.","NA"

Since multi-locus genomic data are becoming increasingly available, there has been considerable interests in the use of DNA sequence data to delimit species. In this paper, we show that machine learning can be used for species delimitation. There exists no species delimitation methods that are based on machine learning. Our method treats the species delimitation problem as a classification problem. It is a problem of identifying the category of a new observation on the basis of training data. Extensive simulation is first conducted over a broad range of evolutionary parameters for training purpose. Each pair of known populations are combined to form training samples with a label of \""same species\"" or \""different species\"". We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to train a classifier using a set of summary statistics computed from training samples as features. The trained classifier can classify a test sample to two outcomes: \""same species\"" or \""different species\"". Given multi-locus genomic data of multiple related organisms or populations, our method (called CLADES) performs species delimitation by first classifying pairs of populations. CLADES then delimits species by maximizing the likelihood of species assignment for multiple populations. CLADES is evaluated through extensive simulation and also tested on real genetic data. We show that CLADES is both accurate and efficient for species delimitation when compared with existing methods. CLADES can be useful especially when existing methods have difficulty in delimitation, e.g. with short species divergence time and gene flow.","10.1111/1755-0998.12887"

While much of the recent work on material perception has focused on static image cues (e.g., textures and shape), little is known whether humans can integrate information over time to make a judgment. Here, we investigate the effect of spatiotemporal information across multiple frames (multi-frame motion) on estimating the bending stiffness of cloth. Using high-fidelity cloth animations, we first examined how the perceived bending stiffness changed as a function of the physical bending stiffness defined in the simulation model. Using maximum likelihood difference scaling methods (MLDS) we found that the perceived stiffness and the physical bending stiffness were highly correlated. A second experiment in which we scrambled the frame sequences diminished this correlation. This suggests that multi-frame motion plays an important role. To provide further evidence for this finding, we extracted dense motion trajectories from the videos across 15 consecutive frames and used the trajectory descriptors to train a machine-learning model with the measured perceptual scales. The model can predict human perceptual scales in new videos with varied winds, optical properties of cloth, and scene setups. When the correct multi-frame was removed (using either scrambled videos or 2-frame optical flow to train the model), the predictions significantly worsened. Our findings demonstrate that multi-frame motion information is important for both humans and machines to estimate the mechanical properties. In addition, we show that dense motion trajectories are effective features to build a successful automatic cloth estimation system.","10.1167/18.5.12"

This measure can be supplemented, and in some cases, replaced by the degree of evenness of the intensity of different ways of using resources. As a result of modeling with use of a new class of mathematical models called Discrete Models of Dynamical Systems, the appearance of matrices representing the sets of these strategies corresponding to combinations of values of the systems parameters in columns, strategies observed for the regimes of maximum and limited usage of resources was analyzed. Using the case study related to a local fish population in a pond, it was shown that, in comparison with the regimes of limited use of resources, the regime of maximum usage distinguishes by a larger degree of evenness of the intensities of different ways of using resources by the system. Different size-age groups of the population play the role of resources.

TF knockdown experiments have revealed correlations between TF binding profiles and gene expression levels. We present a general framework capable of predicting genes with similar tissue-wide expression patterns from activated or repressed TF targets using machine learning to combine TF binding and epigenetic features.\n\nMethodsGenes with correlated expression patterns across 53 tissues were identified according to their Bray-Curtis similarity. DNase I HyperSensitive region (DHS) -accessible promoter intervals of direct TF target genes were scanned with previously derived information theory-based position weight matrices (iPWMs) of 82 TFs. Features from information density-based TFBS clusters were used to predict target genes with machine learning classifiers. The accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the classifiers were determined for different feature sets. Mutations in TFBSs were also introduced to examine their impact on cluster densities and the regulatory states of predicted target genes.\n\nResultsWe initially chose the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1), whose regulation has been extensively studied, to test this approach. SLC25A32 and TANK were found to exhibit the most similar expression patterns to this gene across 53 tissues. Prediction of other genes with similar expression profiles was significantly improved by eliminating inaccessible promoter intervals based on DHSs. A Random Forest classifier exhibited the best performance in detecting such coordinately regulated genes (accuracy was 0.972 for training, 0.976 for testing). Target gene prediction was confirmed using CRISPR knockdown data of TFs, which was more accurate than siRNA inactivation. Mutation analyses of TFBSs also revealed that one or more information-dense TFBS clusters in promoters are required for accurate target gene prediction.\n\nConclusionsMachine learning based on TFBS information density, organization, and chromatin accessibility accurately identifies gene targets with comparable tissue-wide expression patterns. Multiple, information-dense TFBS clusters in promoters appear to protect promoters from the effects of deleterious binding site mutations in a single TFBS that would effectively alter the expression state of these genes.","10.12688/f1000research.17363.1"

It is unclear whether Hsp70 can utilize the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to fold a protein into a native state that is thermodynamically unstable in the chaperone-free equilibrium. Here we present a model of Hsp70-mediated protein folding, which predicts that Hsp70, as a result of differential stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by its Hsp40 cochaperone, dissociates faster from a substrate in fold-competent conformations than from one in misfolding-prone conformations, thus elevating the native concentration above and suppressing the misfolded concentration below their respective equilibrium values. Previous models would not make or imply these predictions, which are experimentally testable. Our model quantitatively reproduces experimental refolding kinetics, predicts how modulations of the Hsp70/Hsp40 chaperone system affect protein folding, and suggests new approaches to regulating cellular protein quality.","10.1038/s41598-018-31641-w"

The dataset included sequences of both bacteria (16S) and fungi (ITS), across multiple environments diverging markedly in abiotic conditions, over three collection times. Despite quantitative differences in microbial richness, we found that all alpha- and beta-diversity metrics were highly positively correlated (r > 0.90) between samples analyzed with both approaches. Moreover, the community composition of the dominant taxa did not vary between approaches. Consequently, statistical inferences were nearly indistinguishable.

Although these T-DNA transfer mechanisms are well understood, detailed understanding of structure and epigenomic status of insertion events was limited by current technologies. To fill this gap, we analyzed transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines from three widely used collections (SALK, SAIL and WISC) with two single molecule technologies, optical genome mapping and nanopore sequencing. Optical maps for four randomly selected T-DNA lines revealed between one and seven insertions/rearrangements, and for the first time the actual length of individual transgene insertions from 27 to 236 kilobases. De novo nanopore sequencing-based genome assemblies for two segregating lines resolved T-DNA structures up to 36 kb into the insertions and revealed large-scale T-DNA associated translocations and exchange of chromosome arm ends. The multiple internally rearranged nature of T-DNA arrays made full assembly impossible, even with long nanopore reads. For the current TAIR10 reference genome, nanopore contigs corrected 83% of non-centromeric misassemblies. This unprecedented nucleotide-level definition of T-DNA insertions enabled the mapping of epigenome data. We identify variable small RNA transgene targeting and DNA methylation.

In type I CRISPR-Cas systems, the Cas protein complex that binds DNA is known as Cascade. Association of Cascade with target DNA can also lead to acquisition of new immunity elements in a process known as primed adaptation. Here, we assess the specificity determinants for Cascade-DNA interaction, interference, and primed adaptation in vivo, for the type I-E system of Escherichia coli. Remarkably, as few as 5 bp of crRNA-DNA are sufficient for association of Cascade with a DNA target. Consequently, a single crRNA promotes Cascade association with numerous off-target sites, and the endogenous E. coli crRNAs direct Cascade binding to >100 chromosomal sites. In contrast to the low specificity of Cascade-DNA interactions, >18 bp are required for both interference and primed adaptation. Hence, Cascade binding to sub-optimal, off-target sites is inert. Our data support a model in which initial Cascade association with DNA targets requires only limited sequence complementarity at the crRNA 5{square} end, whereas recruitment and/or activation of the Cas3 nuclease, a prerequisite for interference and primed adaptation, requires extensive base-pairing.\n\nIMPORTANCEMany bacterial and archaeal species encode CRISPR-Cas immunity systems that protect against invasion by foreign DNA. In the Escherichia coli CRISPR-Cas system, a protein complex, Cascade, binds 61 nt CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs). The Cascade complex is directed to invading DNA molecules through base-pairing between the crRNA and target DNA. This leads to recruitment of the Cas3 nuclease that destroys the invading DNA molecule and promotes acquisition of new immunity elements. We make the first in vivo measurements of Cascade binding to DNA targets. Thus, we show that Cascade binding to DNA is highly promiscuous; endogenous E. coli crRNAs can direct Cascade binding to >100 chromosomal locations. By contrast, we show that target degradation and acquisition of new immunity elements requires highly specific association of Cascade with DNA, limiting CRISPR-Cas function to the appropriate targets.","10.1128/mBio.02100-17"

Previous studies show that arthropod herbivores account for much tropical diversity, yet differences in diversity of arthropod predators between tropical and temperate systems have not been quantified. Here, we present the first standardized tropical-temperate forest comparison of species richness and evenness for understory spiders, a dominant and mega-diverse taxa of generalist predators. Species richness was 13-82 times higher in tropical vs. temperate forests. Evenness was also higher with tropical assemblages having 12-55 times more common and 10-40 times more dominant species. By contrast, proportion of rare species were only up to two times greater than that of temperate measurements. These differences in diversity far surpass previous estimates, and exceed tropical-temperate difference for herbivorous taxa. Thus, the extreme diversity of arthropod predators is associated not only with the higher diversity of prey in tropical vs. temperate ecosystems, but probably also with increased diet breadth of understory spiders in the tropics. This work contradicts the widely accepted hypothesis that tropical diversity is associated with more specialization of predators.","NA"

However, it remains largely untested in vivo whether PcG proteins define chromatin accessibility or other chromatin features. To address this important question, we measured chromatin accessibility and examined the nucleosome landscape at PcG protein-bound promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq. Combined with genetic ablation strategies, we unexpectedly discover that although PcG protein-occupied gene promoters exhibit reduced accessibility, this does not rely on PcG proteins. Instead, the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) appears to play a unique role in driving elevated nucleosome occupancy and decreased nucleosomal spacing in Polycomb chromatin domains. Our new genome-scale observations argue, in contrast to the prevailing view, that PcG proteins and Polycomb chromatin domains do not significantly affect chromatin accessibility and highlight an underappreciated complexity in the relationship between chromatin accessibility, the nucleosome landscape and PcG-mediated transcriptional repression.","10.1101/gr.237180.118"

TEs themselves evolve, with clade specific LTR/ERV, LINEs and SINEs responsible for the bulk of species specific genomic features. Because TEs can contain regulatory motifs, they can be exapted as regulators of gene expression. While TE insertions can provide evolutionary novelty for the regulation of gene expression, their overall impact on the evolution of gene expression is unclear. Previous investigators have shown that tissue specific gene expression in amniotes is more similar across species than within species, supporting the existence of conserved developmental gene regulation. In order to understand how species specific TE insertions might affect the evolution/conservation of gene expression, we have looked at the association of gene expression in six tissues with TE insertions in six representative amniote genomes (human, opossum, platypus, anole lizard, bearded dragon and chicken).\n\nResultsWe have used a novel bootstrapping approach to minimise the conflation of effects of repeat types on gene expression. We compared the expression of orthologs containing different types of recent TE insertions to orthologs that contained older TE insertions and found significant differences in gene expression associated with TE insertions. Likewise, we compared the expression of non-ortholog genes containing different types of recent TE insertions to non-orthologs with older TE insertions and found significant differences in gene expression associated with TE insertions. As expected TEs were associated with species-specific changes in gene expression, but the magnitude and direction of change of expression changes were unexpected. Overall, orthologs containing clade specific TEs were associated with lower gene expression, while in non-orthologs, non clade-specific TEs were associated with higher gene expression. Exceptions were SINE elements in human and chicken, which had an opposite association with gene expression compared to other species.\n\nConclusionsOur observed species-specific associations of TEs with gene expression support a role for TEs in speciation/response to selection by species. TEs do not exhibit consistent associations with gene expression and observed associations can vary depending on the age of TE insertions. Based on these observations, it would be prudent to refrain from extrapolating these and previously reported associations to distantly related species.","10.1186/s13100-018-0124-5"

We identified 49,903 regions exhibiting differential H3K27ac enrichment in asthma, clustered at genes associated with type-2-high asthma (CLCA1) and epithelial processes (EMT). Asthma dramatically influenced the BEC enhancer landscape and we identified asthma-associated Super-Enhancers encompassing genes encoding transcription factors (TP63) and enzymes regulating lipid metabolism (NOX4). We integrated published protein, epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets and identified epithelium-specific transcription factors associated with H3K27ac in asthma (TP73) and dynamic relationships between asthma-associated changes in H3K27ac, DNA methylation, genetic susceptibility and transcriptional profiles. Finally, we used a CRISPR-based approach to recapitulate the H3K27ac-asthma landscape in vitro and provide proof of principal that asthma-associated gene expression (SERPINB2) is driven in part by aberrant histone acetylation, validating the combination of genome-wide and epigenome-editing approaches in deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma pathogenesis.","NA"

To assess whether this goal is being met, we quantified the effect of GWAS on the overall distribution of biomedical research publications and on the subsequent publication history of genes newly associated with complex disease. We found that the historical skew of publications toward genes involved in Mendelian disease has not changed since the advent of GWAS. Genes newly implicated by GWAS in complex disease do experience additional publications compared to control genes, and they are more likely to become exceptionally studied. But the magnitude of both effects has declined dramatically over the past decade. Our results suggest that reforms to encourage follow-up studies may be needed for GWAS to most successfully guide biomedical research toward the molecular mechanisms underlying complex human disease.\n\nAuthor summaryOver the past decade, thousands of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to link genetic variation with complex human disease. A major goal of such studies is to identify novel disease genes, so they can be further studied. We tested whether this goal is being met, by studying patterns of scientific research publications on human genes. We found that publications are still concentrated on genes involved in simple Mendelian disease, even after the advent of GWAS. Compared to other genes, disease genes discovered by GWAS do experience additional publications, but that effect has declined dramatically since GWAS were first performed. Our results suggest that the ability of GWAS to stimulate research into novel disease genes is declining. To realize the full potential of GWAS to reveal the molecular mechanisms driving human disease, this decline and the reasons for it must be understood, so that it can be reversed.","10.1186/s40246-018-0172-4"

A.","Christopher DeBoever","Stanford University","2018-03-16",2,"1","new results","genetics","Whole genome sequencing studies applied to large populations or biobanks with extensive phenotyping raise new analytic challenges. The need to consider many variants at a locus or group of genes simultaneously and the potential to study many correlated phenotypes with shared genetic architecture provide opportunities for discovery and inference that are not addressed by the traditional one variant-one phenotype association study. Here we introduce a model comparison approach we refer to as MRP for rare variant association studies that considers correlation, scale, and location of genetic effects across a group of genetic variants, phenotypes, and studies. We consider the use of summary statistic data to apply univariate and multivariate gene-based meta-analysis models for identifying rare variant associations with an emphasis on protective protein-truncating variants that can expedite drug discovery. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed model comparison approach can improve ability to detect rare variant association signals. We also apply the model to two groups of phenotypes from the UK Biobank: 1) asthma diagnosis, eosinophil counts, forced expiratory volume, and forced vital capacity; and 2) glaucoma diagnosis, intra-ocular pressure, and corneal resistance factor. We are able to recover known associations such as the protective association between rs146597587 in IL33 and asthma. We also find evidence for novel protective associations between rare variants in ANGPTL7 and glaucoma. Overall, we show that the MRP model comparison approach is able to retain and improve upon useful features from widely-used meta-analysis approaches for rare variant association analyses and prioritize protective modifiers of disease risk.\n\nAuthor summaryDue to the continually decreasing cost of acquiring genetic data, we are now beginning to see large collections of individuals for which we have both genetic information and trait data such as disease status, physical measurements, biomarker levels, and more. These datasets offer new opportunities to find relationships between inherited genetic variation and disease. While it is known that there are relationships between different traits, typical genetic analyses only focus on analyzing one genetic variant and one phenotype at a time. Additionally, it is difficult to identify rare genetic variants that are associated with disease due to their scarcity, even among large sample sizes. In this work, we present a method for identifying associations between genetic variation and disease that considers multiple rare variants and phenotypes at the same time. By sharing information across rare variant and phenotypes, we improve our ability to identify rare variants associated with disease compared to considering a single rare variant and a single phenotype. The method can be used to identify candidate disease genes as well as genes that might represent attractive drug targets.","NA"

Although polyploidy is recognized as an important component of plant evolution, it is generally considered to play a relatively minor role in animal evolution. Ancient polyploidy is found in the ancestry of some animals, especially fishes, but there is little evidence for ancient WGDs in other metazoan lineages. Here we use recently published transcriptomes and genomes from more than 150 species across the insect phylogeny to investigate whether ancient WGDs occurred during the evolution of Hexapoda, the most diverse clade of animals. Using gene age distributions and phylogenomics, we found evidence for 18 ancient WGDs and six other large-scale bursts of gene duplication during insect evolution. These bursts of gene duplication occurred in the history of lineages such as the Lepidoptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata. To further corroborate the nature of these duplications, we evaluated the pattern of gene retention from putative WGDs observed in the gene age distributions. We found a relatively strong signal of convergent gene retention across many of the putative insect WGDs. Considering the phylogenetic breadth and depth of the insect phylogeny, this observation is consistent with polyploidy as we expect dosage-balance to drive the parallel retention of genes. Together with recent research on plant evolution, our hexapod results suggest that genome duplications contributed to the evolution of two of the most diverse lineages of eukaryotes on Earth.","10.1073/pnas.1710791115"

To shed light on this subject, we characterised the landscape of pathway alterations associated with somatic mutations observed in 4,415 patients across ten cancer types, using 374 orthogonal pathway gene-sets mapped onto canonical cancer hallmarks. Towards this end, we developed SLAPenrich: a computational method based on population-level statistics, freely available as an open source R package. Assembling the identified pathway alterations into sets of hallmark signatures allowed us to connect somatic mutations to clinically interpretable cancer mechanisms. Further, we explored the heterogeneity of these signatures, in terms of ratio of altered pathways associated with each individual hallmark, assuming that this is reflective of the extent of selective advantage provided to the cancer type under consideration. Our analysis revealed the predominance of certain hallmarks in specific cancer types, thus suggesting different evolutionary trajectories across cancer lineages.\n\nFinally, although many pathway alteration enrichments are guided by somatic mutations in frequently altered high-confidence cancer genes, excluding these driver mutations preserves the hallmark heterogeneity signatures, thus the detected hallmarks predominance across cancer types.

Most patients present with malignant ascites and peritoneal seeding at diagnosis. In the present study, we used a laser-aided isolation technique to investigate the clonal relationship between the primary tumor and tumor spheroids found in the malignant ascites of an EOC patient. Somatic alteration profiles of ovarian cancer-related genes were determined for eight spatially separated samples from primary ovarian tumor tissues and ten tumor spheroids from the malignant ascites using next-generation sequencing.\n\nResultsWe observed high levels of intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) in copy number alterations (CNAs) and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the primary tumor and the tumor spheroids. As a result, we discovered that tumor cells in the primary tissues and the ascites were genetically different lineages. We categorized the CNAs and SNVs into clonal and subclonal alterations according to their distribution among the samples. Also, we identified focal amplifications and deletions in the analyzed samples. For SNVs, a total of 171 somatic mutations were observed, among which 66 were clonal mutations present in both the primary tumor and the ascites, and 61 and 44 of the SNVs were subclonal mutations present in only the primary tumor or the ascites, respectively.\n\nConclusionsBased on the somatic alteration profiles, we constructed phylogenetic trees and inferred the evolutionary history of tumor cells in the patient. The phylogenetic trees constructed using the CNAs and SNVs showed that two branches of the tumor cells diverged early from an ancestral tumor clone during an early metastasis step in the peritoneal cavity.

Ecosystem dynamics are ruled by a subset of dominant species, but it is not clear how losing several of these key species would affect plant-pollinator interactions. We tested how the experimental loss of the most highly visited generalist plants would affect flower visitor abundances (visitation) and pollinator effectiveness (quantity of pollen-tubes within pistils) in several sites. Significant changes in the plant-pollinator communities were detected. Firstly, visitation decreased after removing 1-2 most visited plants, suggesting that these species mostly facilitate other plants by keeping high flower visitor abundances in the sites. Nevertheless, we recorded within-site variations of these trends, especially among sampled transects and among plant species, suggesting that complex facilitation-competition interactions occur among plants, but that these vary among transects within the same sites. Pollinator effectiveness fluctuated but not in a clear linear way and was not directly linked to changes of flower visitation. This suggests that fluctuations of pollinator effectiveness might be due to destabilization of the pollinators by the removal of key resources. In addition, we detected a constrained flexibility of the foraging of flower visitors because they did not switch among flower shapes and they favoured specific plant traits such as high sugar content, small inflorescences and taller plants. Indeed, these constraints would eventually limit utilisation of new resources after perturbations, possibly undermining the stability of the system. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that the loss of dominant, highly generalist plants alters plant-pollinator interactions with implications for pollination and insect foraging. Therefore, in order to preserve ecosystems, generalist plants should not get lost, because they sustain the complex pattern of interactions between plants and flower visitors.","10.1038/s41598-019-43553-4"

Yet scans for positive selection rely on codon models which incorporate an assumption of effectively neutral synonymous substitution rate, constant between sites of each gene. Here we perform a large-scale comparison of approaches which incorporate codon substitution rate variation and propose our own simple yet effective modification of existing models. We find strong effects of substitution rate variation on positive selection inference. More than 70% of the genes detected by the classical branch-site model are presumably false positives caused by the incorrect assumption of uniform synonymous substitution rate. We propose a new model which is strongly favored by the data while remaining computationally tractable. With the new model we can capture signatures of nucleotide level selection acting on translation initiation and on splicing sites within the coding region. Finally, we show that rate variation is highest in the highly recombining regions, and we propose that recombination and mutation rate variation, such as high CpG mutation rate, are the two main sources of nucleotide rate variation. While we detect fewer genes under positive selection in Drosophila than without rate variation, the genes which we detect contain a stronger signal of adaptation of dynein, which could be associated with Wolbachia infection.

Previously, it was shown that iron is required for effective killing of bacterial cells by numerous bactericidal antibiotics. Here, our high-resolution Tn-seq analysis demonstrated that transposon mutants of S. Typhimurium with insertions in essential genes escaped immediate killing or growth inhibition under iron-restricted conditions for approximately one-third of all essential genes.\n\nResultsWe grouped essential genes into two categories, iron-dependent and iron-independent essential genes. The iron-dependency of the iron-dependent essential genes was further validated by the fact that the relative abundance of these essential gene mutants increased further with more severe iron restrictions. Our unexpected observation can be explained well by the recently proposed common killing mechanisms of bactericidal antibiotics via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this model iron restriction would inhibit production of ROS, leading to reduced killing activity following blocking of an essential function. Interestingly, the targets of most antibiotics currently in use clinically, whether bacteriostatic or bactericidal, are iron-dependent essential genes.\n\nConclusionsOur result suggests that targeting iron-independent essential genes may be a better strategy for future antibiotic development, because blocking these genes would lead to immediate cell death regardless of iron concentration. On the contrary, blocking iron-dependent pathways under iron limited in vivo environment could lead to reduced killing action, which might increase drug-resistance by mutagenic action of sublethal concentrations of ROS. This work expands our knowledge on the role of iron to a broader range of essential pathways, and provides novel insights for development of more effective antibiotics.","10.1186/s12864-018-4986-1"

Although methods to detect rhythmicity in genome-scale data are well established, methods to detect changes in rhythmicity or in average expression between experimental conditions are often ad hoc. Here we present LimoRhyde (linear models for rhythmicity, design), a flexible approach for analyzing transcriptome data from circadian systems. Borrowing from cosinor regression, LimoRhyde decomposes circadian or zeitgeber time into multiple components, in order to fit a linear model to the expression of each gene. The linear model can accommodate any number of additional experimental variables, whether discrete or continuous, making it straightforward to detect differential rhythmicity and differential expression using state-of-the-art methods for analyzing microarray and RNA-seq data. In this approach, differential rhythmicity corresponds to a statistical interaction between an experimental variable and circadian time, whereas differential expression corresponds to the main effect of an experimental variable while accounting for circadian time. To demonstrate LimoRhydes versatility, we applied it to murine and human circadian transcriptome datasets acquired under various experimental designs. Our results show how LimoRhyde systematizes the analysis of such data, and suggest that LimoRhyde could become a valuable approach for assessing how circadian systems respond to genetic and environmental perturbations.","10.1177/0748730418813785"

The main D. melanogaster anterior determinant, bicoid, is maternally transcribed, but it is not translated until early embryogenesis. We investigated the possibility that its translational repression during oogenesis is mediated by miRNA activity. We found that the bicoid 3UTR contains a highly conserved, predicted binding site for miR-305. Our studies reveal that miR-305 regulates the translation of a reporter gene containing the bicoid 3UTR in cell culture, and that miR-305 only partially contributes to bicoid mRNA translational repression during oogenesis. We also found that Processing bodies (P-bodies) in the egg chamber may play a role in stabilizing bicoid and other maternal transcripts. Here, we offer insights into the possible role of P-bodies and the miRNA pathway in the translational repression of bicoid mRNA during oogenesis.","NA"

Recent work has broadened the scope of QTL mapping to identify genetic loci that influence phenotype variance, termed \""variance QTL\"", or some combination of mean and variance, which we term \""mean-variance QTL\"". Even these approaches, however, fail to address situations where some other factor, be it an environmental factor or a distant genetic locus, influences phenotype variance. We term this situation \""background variance heterogeneity\"" (BVH) and used simulation to explore its effects on the power and false positive rate of tests for mean QTL, variance QTL, and mean-variance QTL. Specifically, we compared traditional tests, linear regression for mean QTL and Levenes test for variance QTL, with tests more recently developed, namely Caos tests for all three types of QTL, and tests based on the double generalized linear model (DGLM), which, unlike the other approaches, explicitly models BVH. Simulations showed that, when used in conjunction with a permutation procedure, the DGLM-based tests accurately control false positive rate and are more powerful than the other tests. We also discovered that the rank-based inverse normal transform, often used to corral unruly phenotypes, can be used to mitigate the adverse effects of BVH in some circumstances. We applied the DGLM approach, which we term \""mean-variance QTL mapping\"", to publicly available data on a mouse backcross of CAST/Ei into M16i and, after accommodating BVH driven by father, identified a new mean QTL for bodyweight at three weeks of age.","10.1534/g3.118.200790"

In some winged insects, the imago is altered by life history changes. For instance, in scale insects and mealybugs, reproductive females retain juvenile features and are wingless. The transcription factor E93 triggers metamorphosis and plays in concert with the juvenile hormone pathway to guarantee the successful transition from juvenile to adult. We previously provided evidence of an atypical down-regulation of the juvenile hormone pathway during female adult development in the Japanese mealybug. Here, we further investigate how E93 is involved in the production of neotenic wingless females, by identifying its isoforms, assessing their expression patterns and evaluating the effect of exogenous juvenile hormone mimic treatment on E93. This study identifies three E93 isoforms on the 5 end based on Japanese mealybug cDNA and shows that female development occurs with the near absence of E93 transcripts, as opposed to male metamorphosis. Additionally, while male development is typically affected by exogenous juvenile hormone mimic treatments, females seem to remain insensitive to the treatment, and up-regulation of the juvenile hormone signaling is not observed. Furthermore, juvenile hormone mimic treatment on female nymphs did not have obvious effect on E93 transcription, while treatment on male prepupae resulted in decreased E93 transcripts. In this study, we emphasize the importance of examining cases of atypical metamorphosis as complementary systems to provide a better understanding on the molecular mechanisms underlying insect metamorphosis. For instance, the factors regulating the expression of E93 are largely unclear. Investigating the regulatory mechanism of E93 transcription could provide clues towards identifying the factors that induce or suppress E93 transcription, in turn triggering male adult development or female neoteny.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=91 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/283556v1_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dca37corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7142a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce7675org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c30267_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- Neotenic female Planococcus kraunhiae (Japanese mealybug) develops with low E93 expression.\n- E93 expression pattern during male development is typical to other insects.\n- Juvenile hormone mimic treatment on male prepupae results in decreased E93 transcripts.\n- Juvenile hormone mimic treatment on female nymphs does not have obvious effects on E93 transcription.\n- Female mealybugs have low sensitivity to juvenile hormone mimic treatments compared to males and other insects.","10.1016/j.ibmb.2018.11.008"

Various models have been proposed to describe the durations of each phase, including a two-state model with fixed S-G2-M duration and random G1 duration1,2; a \""stretched\"" model in which phase durations are proportional3; and an inheritance model in which sister cells show correlated phase durations2,4. A fundamental challenge is to understand the quantitative laws that govern cell-cycle progression and to reconcile the evidence supporting these different models. Here, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to quantify the durations of G1, S, G2, and M phases for thousands of individual cells from three human cell lines. We found no evidence of correlation between any pair of phase durations. Instead, each phase followed an Erlang distribution with a characteristic rate and number of steps. These observations suggest that each cell cycle phase is memoryless with respect to previous phase durations. We challenged this model by perturbing the durations of specific phases through oncogene activation, inhibition of DNA synthesis, reduced temperature, and DNA damage. Phase durations remained uncoupled in individual cells despite large changes in durations in cell populations. To explain this behavior, we propose a mathematical model in which the independence of cell-cycle phase durations arises from a large number of molecular factors that each exerts a minor influence on the rate of cell-cycle progression. The model predicts that it is possible to force correlations between phases by making large perturbations to a single factor that contributes to more than one phase duration, which we confirmed experimentally by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). We further report that phases can show coupling under certain dysfunctional states such as in a transformed cell line with defective cell cycle checkpoints. This quantitative model of cell cycle progression explains the paradoxical observation that phase durations are both inherited and independent and suggests how cell cycle progression may be altered in disease states.","10.15252/msb.20188604"

HA is commercially produced from pathogenic microbial sources. HA-producing recombinant cell factories that are being developed with GRAS organisms are comparatively less productive than the best natural producers.

Here, we use a genome-scale metabolic network model to account for the entire metabolic network of the cell to predict strategies for improving HA production. We here analyze the metabolic network of Lactococcus lactis adapted to produce HA, and identify non-conventional overexpression and knock-out strategies to enhance HA flux.\n\nTo experimentally validate our predictions, we identify an alternate route for enhancement of HA synthesis, originating from the nucleoside inosine, which has the capacity to function in parallel with the traditionally known route from glucose. Adopting this strategy resulted in a 2.8-fold increase in HA yield. The strategies identified and the experimental results show that the cell is capable of involving a larger subset of metabolic pathways in HA production. Apart from being the first report of the use of a nucleoside to improve HA production, our study shows how experimental results enable model refinement.

This allowed us to build a predictive model to compute DNA stretching stiffness from solely its structure. Sequences with very little crookedness show extremely high stiffness and have been previously shown to form unstable nucleosomes and promote gene expression. Interestingly, the crookedness can be tailored by epigenetic modifications, known to affect gene expression.

Phylogenetic mapping shows that in all lineages except Characoidei (Characiformes) adipose fins develop from a domain of the larval median fin fold. To inform how the larvas median fin fold contributes to the adipose fin, we study Corydoras aeneus (Siluriformes). As the fin fold reduces around the prospective site of the adipose fin, a fin spine develops in the fold, growing both proximally and distally, and sensory innervation, which appears to originate from the recurrent ramus of the facial nerve and from dorsal rami of the spinal cord, develops in the adipose fin membrane. Collectively, these data show how a plesiomorphic median fin fold can serve as scaffolding for the evolution and development of novel, individuated median fins, consistent with the median fin fold hypothesis.","10.1038/s41598-018-37040-5"

Converging lines of evidence motivate the hypothesis that these effects are mediated by the central extended amygdala (EAc)--including the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST)--but the relevance of this circuitry to acute alcohol effects in humans remains poorly understood. Using a single-blind, randomized-groups design, multiband imaging data were acquired from 49 social drinkers while they performed an fMRI-optimized emotional-faces/places paradigm after consuming alcohol or placebo. Relative to placebo, alcohol significantly dampened reactivity to threat-related emotional faces in the BST. To rigorously assess potential regional differences in activation, data were extracted from anatomically defined Ce and BST regions-of-interest. Analyses revealed a similar pattern of dampening across the two regions. In short, alcohol acutely dampens reactivity to threat-related faces in humans and it does so similarly across the two major divisions of the EAc. These observations provide a framework for understanding the translational relevance of addiction models derived from work in rodents, inform on-going debates about the functional organization of the EAc, and set the stage for bi-directional translational models aimed at developing improved treatment strategies for alcohol abuse and other addictions.","NA"

This calculus entails finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic attractor landscape, affording an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they can be controlled on the other plane. Based on these methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the systems actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields a suite of universal parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle and a systems (re)programmability index.

Fixed major QTL in species differences lead to hybrids with higher trait variation, and hence evolvability, than the parent species. Back and crown plumage show no correlation between current within-parent variability and among-parent differentiation. For these traits, Italian sparrow phenotypes are biased towards axes of high parental differentiation and show greater phenotypic novelty along axes of low current parental evolvability, as predicted when major QTL are involved in species differences. Crown color has consistently evolved back towards one parent, while back color varies among islands. We also find significant among-population diversification within the Italian sparrow.

The need to consider many variants at a locus or group of genes simultaneously and the potential to study many correlated phenotypes with shared genetic architecture provide opportunities for discovery and inference that are not addressed by the traditional one variant-one phenotype association study. Here we introduce a model comparison approach we refer to as MRP for rare variant association studies that considers correlation, scale, and location of genetic effects across a group of genetic variants, phenotypes, and studies. We consider the use of summary statistic data to apply univariate and multivariate gene-based meta-analysis models for identifying rare variant associations with an emphasis on protective protein-truncating variants that can expedite drug discovery. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed model comparison approach can improve ability to detect rare variant association signals. We also apply the model to two groups of phenotypes from the UK Biobank: 1) asthma diagnosis, eosinophil counts, forced expiratory volume, and forced vital capacity; and 2) glaucoma diagnosis, intra-ocular pressure, and corneal resistance factor. We are able to recover known associations such as the protective association between rs146597587 in IL33 and asthma. We also find evidence for novel protective associations between rare variants in ANGPTL7 and glaucoma. Overall, we show that the MRP model comparison approach is able to retain and improve upon useful features from widely-used meta-analysis approaches for rare variant association analyses and prioritize protective modifiers of disease risk.\n\nAuthor summaryDue to the continually decreasing cost of acquiring genetic data, we are now beginning to see large collections of individuals for which we have both genetic information and trait data such as disease status, physical measurements, biomarker levels, and more. These datasets offer new opportunities to find relationships between inherited genetic variation and disease. While it is known that there are relationships between different traits, typical genetic analyses only focus on analyzing one genetic variant and one phenotype at a time. Additionally, it is difficult to identify rare genetic variants that are associated with disease due to their scarcity, even among large sample sizes. In this work, we present a method for identifying associations between genetic variation and disease that considers multiple rare variants and phenotypes at the same time.

They play an essential role in a range of metabolic, physiological, and developmental processes, including the development of the nervous system (NS). These transcription factors have been studied in many metazoans, especially in vertebrates but also in early branching metazoan clades such as the cnidarians and sponges. However, currently very little is known about their expression in the most basally branching bilaterian group, the xenacoelomorphs. Recently, our laboratory has characterized the full complement of bHLH in the genome of two members of the Xenacoelomorpha, the xenoturbellid Xenoturbella bocki and the acoel Symsagittifera roscoffensis. Understanding the patterns of bHLH gene expression in members of this phylum (in space and time) provides critical new insights into the conserved roles of the bHLH and their putative specificities in this group. Our focus is on deciphering the specific roles that these genes have in the process of neurogenesis.\n\nResultsHere, we analyze the developmental expression of the whole complement of bHLH genes identified in the acoel S. roscoffensis. Based on their expression patterns several members of bHLH class A appear to have specific conserved roles in neurogenesis, while other class A genes (as well as members of other classes) have likely taken on more generalized functions. All gene expression patterns are described in embryos and early juveniles.\n\nConclusionOur results suggest that the main roles of the bHLH genes of S. roscoffensis are evolutionarily conserved, with a specific subset dedicated to patterning the nervous system: SrAscA, SrAscB, SrHes/Hey, SrNscl, SrSrebp, SrE12/E47 and SrOlig.","10.1186/s13227-018-0097-y"

We characterised the skin and gut microbiome of seven populations of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) inhabiting a diverse range of environments, including hatchery-reared and wild populations. We found shared skin OTUs across all populations and core gut microbiota for all wild fish, but the diversity and structure of both skin and gut microbial communities were distinct between populations. There was a marked difference between the gut microbiome of wild and captive fish. Hatchery-reared fish had lower intestinal microbial diversity, lacked core microbiota found in wild fish, and showed altered community structure and function. Captive fish skin and gut microbiomes were also less variable within populations, reflecting more uniform artificial rearing conditions. Surrounding water influenced the microbiome of the gut and, especially, the skin, but could not explain the degree of variation observed between populations. For both the gut and the skin, we found that there was greater difference in microbial community structure between more genetically distinct fish populations, and also that population genetic diversity was positively correlated with microbiome diversity. However, dietary differences are likely to be the major factor contributing to the large differences found in the gut microbiome between wild and captive fish. Our results highlight the scope of inter-population variation in the microbiome, and offer insights into the contributing deterministic factors.","10.1128/aem.00691-18"

Despite having similar biological developmental steps, pollen grain surface features are remarkably geometrically varied. Previous work suggests that a physical process may drive this pattern formation and that the observed diversity of patterns can be explained by viewing pollen pattern development as a phase transition to a spatially modulated phase. Several studies have shown that the polysaccharide material of plant cell walls undergoes phase separation in the absence of cross-linking stabilizers of the mixed phase. Here we show experimental evidence that phase separation of the extracellular polysaccharide material (primexine) during pollen cell development leads to a spatially modulated phase. The spatial pattern of this phase-separated primexine is also mechanically coupled to the undulation of the pollen cell membrane. The resulting patterned pools of denser primexine form the negative template of the ultimate sites of sporopollenin deposition, leading to the final micropattern observed in the mature pollen. We then present a general physical model of pattern formation via modulated phases. Using analytical and numerical techniques, we find that most of the pollen micropatterns observed in biological evolution could result from a physical process of modulated phases. However, an analysis of the relative rates of transitions from states that are equilibrated to or from states that are not equilibrated suggests that while equilibrium states of this process have occurred throughout evolutionary history, there has been no particular evolutionary selection for symmetric, equilibrated states.","10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.014"

For ectothermic species with broad geographical distributions, latitudinal/altitudinal variation in environmental temperatures (averages and extremes) are expected to shape the evolution of physiological tolerances and the acclimation capacity (i.e., degree of phenotypic plasticity) of natural populations. This can create geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favour individuals that maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural selection targets this trait in natural populations. Here we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge by measuring survival, through mark recapture integrated into an information-theoretic approach, as a function of the plasticity of critical thermal limits for activity, behavioural thermal preference and the thermal sensitivity of metabolism in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog Pleurodema thaul. Overall, our results indicate that thermal acclimation in this population is not being targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models, survival decreased in individuals with less tolerance to cold when cold-acclimated (probably because daily low extremes are frequent during the cooler periods of the year) and increased with body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates were non-significant.","10.1111/eva.12702"

In the past decades, much effort has been devoted to infer the importance of a particular structure by its capacity to tolerate an external perturbation on its structure or dynamics. Here we demonstrate that such a perspective leads to inconsistent conclusions. That is, the importance of a network structure changes as a function of the external perturbations acting on a community at any given point in time. Thus, we discuss a research agenda to investigate the relative importance of the structure of ecological networks under an environment-dependent framework. We hypothesize that only by studying systematically the link between network structure and community dynamics under an environment-dependent framework, we can uncover the limits at which communities can tolerate environmental changes.\n\n\""Variation stands out as the only meaningful reality\""\n\nStephen J.

To address this problem, we generated an adeno-associated virus vector named RPF2 that was engineered to express domains of leukemia inhibitory factor fused to the destabilization domain of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase. Fusion proteins containing the destabilization domain are degraded in mammalian cells but can be stabilized with the binding of the drug trimethoprim. Our data show that expression levels of RPF2 are tightly regulated by the dose of trimethoprim, and can be reversed by trimethoprim withdrawal.

Here, we instead propose that top-down effects are more complex and manifest in ways that depend not only on attention but also other cognitive processes involved in executing a task. To substantiate this theory, we analyze fMRI responses in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in a study where stimulus eccentricity and cognitive task are varied. We find that as stimuli are presented farther into the periphery, bottom-up stimulus-driven responses decline but top-down attentional enhancement increases substantially. This disproportionate enhancement of weak responses cannot be easily explained by conventional models of attention. Furthermore, we find that attentional effects depend on the specific cognitive task performed by the subject, indicating the influence of additional cognitive processes other than attention (e.g., decision-making). The effects we observe replicate in an independent experiment from the same study, and also generalize to a separate study involving different stimulus manipulations (contrast and phase coherence).

Organisms that can survive such conditions merit planetary protection concern and if that resistance can be transferred to other organisms, a health concern too. To further efforts to understand these resistances, the complete genome of Bacillus safensis strain FO-36b, which produces spore resistant to peroxide and radiation was determined. The genome was compared to the complete genome of B. pumilus SAFR-032, as well as draft genomes of B. safensis JPL-MERTA-8-2 and the type strain B. pumilus ATCC7061T. In addition, comparisons were made to 61 draft genomes that have been mostly identified as strains of B. pumilus or B. safensis.\n\nResultsThe FO-36b gene order is essentially the same as that in SAFR-032 and other B. pumilus strains [1]. The annotated genome has 3850 open reading frames and 40 noncoding RNAs and riboswitches. Of these, 307 are not shared by SAFR-032, and 65 are also not shared by either MERTA or ATCC7061T. The FO-36b genome was found to have ten unique reading frames and two phage-like regions, which have homology with the Bacillus bacteriophage SPP1 (NC_004166) and Brevibacillus phage Jimmer1 (NC_029104). Differing remnants of the Jimmer1 phage are found in essentially all safensis/pumilus strains. Seven unique genes are part of these phage elements. Comparison of gyrA sequences from FO-36b, SAFR-032, ATCC7061T, and 61 other draft genomes separate the various strains into three distinct clusters.

It is quite possible that distinctions in gene regulation can change the level of expression of key proteins thereby changing the organisms resistance properties without gain or loss of a particular gene. What is clear is that phage elements contribute significantly to genome variability.

Mechanisms that determine how the distinct and overlapping functions of multiple activity-responsive transcription factors, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B), give rise to stimulus-appropriate neuronal responses remain unclear. We report that the p65/RelA subunit of NF-{kappa}B confers subcellular enrichment at neuronal dendritic spines and engineer a p65 mutant that lacks spine-enrichment ({Delta}SEp65) but retains inherent transcriptional activity equivalent to wild-type p65. Wild-type p65 or {Delta}SEp65 both rescue NF-{kappa}B-dependent gene expression in p65-deficient murine hippocampal neurons responding to diffuse (PMA/ionomycin) stimulation. In contrast, neurons lacking spine-enriched NF-{kappa}B are selectively impaired in NF-{kappa}B-dependent gene expression induced by elevated excitatory synaptic stimulation (bicuculline or glycine). We used the setting of excitatory synaptic activity during development that produces NF-{kappa}B-dependent growth of dendritic spines to test physiological function of spine-enriched NF-{kappa}B in an activity-dependent response. Expression of wild-type p65, but not {Delta}SEp65, is capable of rescuing spine density to normal levels in p65-deficient pyramidal neurons. Collectively, these data reveal that spatial localization in dendritic spines contributes unique capacities to the NF-{kappa}B transcription factor in synaptic activity-dependent responses.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTExtensive research has established a model in which the regulation of neuronal gene expression enables enduring forms of plasticity and learning. However, mechanisms imparting stimulus-specificity to gene regulation, insuring biologically appropriate responses, remain incompletely understood. NF-{kappa}B is a potent transcription factor with evolutionarily-conserved functions in learning and the growth of excitatory synaptic contacts. Neuronal NF-{kappa}B is localized in both synapse and somatic compartments, but whether the synaptic pool of NF-{kappa}B has discrete functions is unknown. This study reveals that NF-{kappa}B enriched in dendritic spines (the postsynaptic sites of excitatory contacts) is selectively required for NF-{kappa}B activation by synaptic stimulation and normal dendritic spine development.

Bile acids (BA), products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer disease (AD).\n\nMethodsSerum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1,464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults (CN), 284 with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 505 with late MCI, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for cofounders and multiple testing.\n\nResultsIn AD compared to CN, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic acid CA) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, deoxycholic acid (DCA), and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of DCA:CA, which reflects 7-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles.\n\nConclusionWe report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study. These findings warrant further investigation of gut dysbiosis and possible role of gut liver brain axis in the pathogenesis of AD.","10.1016/j.jalz.2018.07.217"

The mechanisms that drive AIV evolution are complex at sites where various duck and gull species from multiple flyways breed, winter or stage. The Republic of Georgia is located at the intersection of three migratory flyways: Central Asian Flyway, East Asian/East African Flyway and Black Sea/Mediterranean Flyway. For six consecutive years (2010-2016), we collected AIV samples from various duck and gull species that breed, migrate and overwinter in Georgia. We found substantial subtype diversity of viruses that varied in prevalence from year to year. Low pathogenic (LP)AIV subtypes included H1N1, H2N3, H2N5, H2N7, H3N8, H4N2, H6N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N1, H9N3, H10N4, H10N7, H11N1, H13N2, H13N6, H13N8, H16N3, plus two H5N5 and H5N8 highly pathogenic (HP)AIVs belonging to clade 2.3.4.4. Whole genome phylogenetic trees showed significant host species lineage restriction for nearly all gene segments and significant differences for LPAIVs among different host species in observed reassortment rates, as defined by quantification of phylogenetic incongruence, and in nucleotide diversity. Hemagglutinin clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 viruses, circulated in Eurasia during 2014-2015 did not reassort, but analysis after its subsequent dissemination during 2016-2017 revealed reassortment in all gene segments except NP and NS. Some virus lineages appeared to be unrelated to AIVs in wild bird populations in other regions with maintenance of local AIV viruses in Georgia, whereas other lineages showed considerable genetic inter-relationship with viruses circulating in other parts of Eurasia and Africa, despite relative under-sampling in the area.\n\nImportanceWaterbirds (e.g., gulls/ducks) are natural reservoirs of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and have been shown to mediate dispersal of AIV at inter-continental scales during seasonal migration. The segmented genome of influenza viruses enables viral RNA from different lineages to mix or re-assort when two viruses infect the same host. Such reassortant viruses have been identified in most major human influenza pandemics and several poultry outbreaks. Despite their importance, we have only recently begun to understand AIV evolution and reassortment in their natural host reservoirs. This comprehensive study illustrates of AIV evolutionary dynamics within a multi-host ecosystem at a stop-over site where three major migratory flyways intersect. Our analysis of this ecosystem over a six-year period provides a snapshot of how these viruses are linked to global AIV populations. Understanding the evolution of AIVs in the natural host is imperative to both mitigating the risk of incursion into domestic poultry and potential risk to mammalian hosts including humans.","10.1128/jvi.00433-18"

Using a new experimentally validated PC model, we describe the full range of modifiability of CF responses to explain the experimental data and make new predictions. We find voltage state gates the initiation and propagation of dendritic spikes. PC dendrites exhibit inhomogeneous excitability with individual branches as computational units for CF input. Somatic CSs are regulated by voltage state, CF activation phase and instantaneous CF firing rate. Concurrent synaptic inputs can affect CSs by modulating dendritic responses in a spatially precise way. These voltage- and branch-specific CF responses will increase dendritic computational capacity and give PCs an active role in integrating CF signals.","10.1016/j.celrep.2018.07.011"

Golden","University of California, San Diego","2018-03-17",1,"15","new results","microbiology","The recurrent pattern of light and darkness generated by Earths axial rotation has profoundly influenced the evolution of organisms, selecting for both biological mechanisms that respond acutely to environmental changes and circadian clocks that program physiology in anticipation of daily variations. The necessity to integrate environmental responsiveness and circadian programming is exemplified in photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria, which depend on light-driven photochemical processes. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 is an excellent model system for dissecting these entwined mechanisms. Its core circadian oscillator, consisting of three proteins KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, transmits time-of-day signals to clock-output proteins, which reciprocally regulate global transcription. Research performed under constant light facilitates analysis of intrinsic cycles separately from direct environmental responses, but does not provide insight into how these regulatory systems are integrated during light-dark cycles. Thus, we sought to identify genes that are specifically necessary in a day-night environment. We screened a dense bar-coded transposon library in both continuous light and daily cycling conditions and compared the fitness consequences of loss of each nonessential gene in the genome. Although the clock itself is not essential for viability in light-dark cycles, the most detrimental mutations revealed by the screen were those that disrupt KaiA. The screen broadened our understanding of light-dark survival in photosynthetic organisms, identified unforeseen clock-protein interaction dynamics, and reinforced the role of the clock as a negative regulator of a night-time metabolic program that is essential for S. elongatus to survive in the dark.\n\nSignificanceUnderstanding how photosynthetic bacteria respond to and anticipate natural light-dark cycles is necessary for predictive modeling, bioengineering, and elucidating metabolic strategies for diurnal growth. Here, we identify the genetic components that are important specifically under light-dark cycling conditions and determine how a properly functioning circadian clock prepares metabolism for darkness, a starvation period for photoautotrophs. This study establishes that the core circadian clock protein KaiA is necessary to enable rhythmic de-repression of a night-time circadian program.","10.1073/pnas.1802940115"

The factors that give rise to these individual differences, however, remain largely unknown. To examine these factors, we separately measured fMRI responses to moving gratings in the motion-selective region MT, and perceptual duration thresholds for motion direction discrimination within the same group of male and female subjects. Further, we acquired MR spectroscopy data that allowed us to quantify an index of neurotransmitter levels in the region surrounding MT. We show that individual differences in the Glx (glutamate + glutamine) signal in the MT region are associated with both higher fMRI responses and improved psychophysical task performance. Our results suggest that individual differences in baseline levels of glutamate within MT contribute to motion perception by increasing neural responses in this region.\n\nSignificanceWhat factors govern the relationship between neural activity and behavior? Our results suggest that one such factor is the level of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, within a particular region of cortex. By measuring an index of glutamate in vivo using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that human subjects with more glutamate in the visual motion area known as MT also have larger fMRI responses (an index of neural activity) in this region. Further, people with more glutamate in MT can accurately perceive moving images presented more briefly within a behavioral task. Our findings point to an important role for glutamate levels in determining the relationship between neural responses and behavior during visual motion perception.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.001"

These signals, often interpreted as the representation of a decision variable (DV), have been identified in several motor preparation circuits and provide insight about mechanisms underlying the decision-making process. However, single-trial dynamics of this process or its representation at the neural population level remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the representation of the DV in simultaneously recorded neural populations of dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortices of monkeys performing a random dots direction discrimination task with arm movements as the behavioral report. We show that single-trial DVs covary with stimulus difficulty in both areas but are stronger and appear earlier in PMd compared to M1 when the stimulus duration is fixed and predictable. When temporal uncertainty is introduced by making the stimulus duration variable, single-trial DV dynamics are accelerated across the board and the two areas become largely indistinguishable throughout the entire trial. These effects are not trivially explained by the faster emergence of motor kinematic signals in PMd and M1. All key aspects of the data were replicated by a computational model that relies on progressive recruitment of units with stable choice-related modulation of neural population activity. In contrast with several recent results in rodents, decision signals in PMd and M1 are not carried by short sequences of activity in non-overlapping groups of neurons but are instead distributed across many neurons, which once recruited, represent the decision stably during individual behavioral epochs of the trial.","NA"

Representatives of the species-rich families Gyrodactylidae and Dactylogyridae, especially those infecting cichlid fishes and clariid catfishes, are important parasites in African aquaculture, even more so due to the massive anthropogenic translocation of their hosts worldwide. Several questions on their evolution, such as the phylogenetic position of Macrogyrodactylus and the highly speciose Gyrodactylus, remain unresolved with available molecular markers. Also, diagnostics and population-level research would benefit from the development of higher-resolution genetic markers. We aim to advance genetic work on African monogeneans by providing mitogenomic data of four species (two each belonging to the Gyrodactylidae and Dactylogyridae), and analysing their gene sequences and gene order from a phylogenetic perspective.\n\nResultsBased on Illumina technology, the first four mitochondrial genomes of African monogeneans were assembled and annotated for the cichlid parasites Gyrodactylus nyanzae, Cichlidogyrus halli, Cichlidogyrus mbirizei (near-complete mitogenome) and the catfish parasite Macrogyrodactylus karibae (near-complete mitogenome). The start codon TTG is new for Gyrodactylus and for the Dactylogyridae, as is the incomplete stop codon TA for the Dactylogyridae. The most variable markers are nad genes and these are under relaxed selection. Especially nad2 is promising for primer development. Gene order was identical for protein-coding genes and differed between the African representatives of these families only in a tRNA gene transposition. A mitochondrial phylogeny based on an alignment of nearly 12,500 bp including 12 protein-coding and two ribosomal RNA genes confirms that the Neotropical oviparous Aglaiogyrodactylus forficulatus takes a sister group position with respect to the other gyrodactylids, rather than the supposedly  primitive African Macrogyrodactylus. Inclusion of the African Gyrodactylus nyanzae confirms the paraphyly of Gyrodactylus. The position of the African dactylogyrid Cichlidogyrus is unresolved, although gene order suggests it is closely related to marine ancyrocephalines.\n\nConclusionsThe amount of mitogenomic data available for gyrodactylids and dactylogyrids is increased by roughly one-third. Our study underscores the potential of mitochondrial genes and gene order in flatworm phylogenetics, and of next-generation sequencing for marker development for these non-model helminths for which few primers are available while they constitute a risk to tropical aquaculture.","10.1186/s12864-018-4893-5"

This theory, however, makes several ecologically unrealistic assumptions. First, this theory assumes that consumers have a linear, resource-dependent functional response, ignoring well-documented effects of resource handling times and consumer dependence. Second, this theory assumes that the trait under selection only influences the percapita attack rates of the consumer, ignoring other effects of the trait that may influence feeding rates and hence fitness. Here, I develop a one consumer-two resource model to investigate how nonlinear functional responses and ecological pleiotropy (traits that have multiple simultaneous ecological effects) influence the strength of disruptive selection. I find that handling times and interference among consumers are capable of altering disruptive selection by changing feeding rates differentially across consumer phenotypes. In particular, handling times cause a decrease in the strength of disruptive selection while the effects of interference depend on the mechanism through which interference occurs. The effects of handling times and interference, however, are dependent on whether and how ecological pleiotropy causes correlations between handling times or interference rates and attack rates. Overall, my results suggest that features defining the functional responses of consumers and the relationships among those features determine the likelihood and strength of disruptive selection. In particular, disruptive selection should be strongest in generalist populations composed of individual diet specialists who experience lower handling times and interference rates on the resources for which their attack rates are highest.","NA"

However, reversible inhibition experiments suggest that the ventromedial hypothalamus and periaqueductal grey play distinct roles in the control of defensive behavior, with the former proposed to encode an internal state necessary for the motivation of defensive responses, while the latter serves as a motor pattern initiator.

We demonstrate that systematic conservation planning is efficient for identifying priority areas representing a predefined part of the total genetic diversity of a whole landscape. With the exception of private allelic richness, classical genetic diversity indices (allelic richness, genetic uniqueness) were poor predictors for identifying priority areas. Moreover, we identified weak surrogacies among conservation solutions found for each species, implying that conservation solutions are highly species-specific.

We introduce a model-free normalization procedure where features (i.e. bacterial taxa) in case samples are converted to percentiles of the equivalent features in control samples within a study prior to pooling data across studies. We look at how this percentile-normalization method compares to traditional meta-analysis methods for combining independent p-values and to limma and ComBat, widely used batch-correction models developed for RNA microarray data.

In statistical terms, this means that traits measured on one species will not be independent of traits measured on others. Since their introduction in the 1980s, phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have been framed as a solution to this problem. In this paper, we argue that this way of thinking about PCMs is deeply misleading. Not only has this sowed widespread confusion in the literature about what PCMs are doing but has led us to develop methods that are susceptible to the very thing we sought to build defenses against -- unreplicated evolutionary events. Through three Case Studies, we demonstrate that the susceptibility to singular events is indeed a recurring problem in comparative biology that links several seemingly unrelated controversies. In each Case Study we propose a potential solution to the problem. While the details of our proposed solutions differ, they share a common theme: unifying hypothesis testing with data-driven approaches (which we term \""phylogenetic natural history\"") to disentangle the impact of singular evolutionary events from that of the factors we are investigating. More broadly, we argue that our field has, at times, been sloppy when weighing evidence in support of causal hypotheses. We suggest that one way to refine our inferences is to re-imagine phylogenies as probabilistic graphical models; adopting this way of thinking will help clarify precisely what we are testing and what evidence supports our claims.","10.1093/sysbio/syy031"

Another species, Tritonia diomedea, reliably swims and does not vary in serotonergic neuromodulation. A third species, Hermissenda crassicornis, never produces this behavior and lacks the neuromodulation. We found that expression of particular 5-HT receptor genes in C2 correlates with swimming. Seven 5-HT receptor subtype genes were identified from whole-brain transcriptomes. We isolated individual C2 neurons and sequenced their RNA or measured 5-HT receptor gene expression using quantitative PCR. C2 neurons isolated from Pleurobranchaea individuals that produced a swim motor pattern just prior to isolation expressed the 5-HT2a and 5-HT7 receptor genes, as did the Tritonia samples. These subtypes were absent from C2 neurons isolated from Pleurobranchaea individuals that did not swim that day and from Hermissenda C2 neurons. Expression of other receptors did not correlate with swimming. This suggests that 5-HT2a and 5-HT7 receptors mediate the modulation of C2 synaptic strength and play an important role in swimming. Furthermore, the results suggest that regulation of receptor expression might underlie daily changes in behavior as well as behavioral evolution.","NA"

Such a representation contains all sequence information but does not store contextual information and metadata.\n\nResultsWe present two new approaches for a compressed representation of a graph coloring: a lossless compression scheme based on a novel application of wavelet tries as well as a highly accurate lossy compression based on a set of Bloom filters. Both strategies retain a coloring with dynamically changing graph topology. We present construction and merge procedures for both methods and evaluate their performance on a wide range of different datasets.

We have integrated transposon mutagenesis screening in an EGFR-mutant cell line and clinical genomic sequencing in cases of acquired resistance to identify novel mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors. The most prominent candidate genes identified by insertions in or near the genes during the screen were MET, a gene whose amplification is known to mediate resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and the gene encoding the Src family kinase YES1. Cell clones with transposon insertions that activated expression of YES1 exhibited resistance to all three generations of EGFR inhibitors and sensitivity to pharmacologic and siRNA-mediated inhibition of YES1. Analysis of clinical genomic sequencing data from cases of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors revealed amplification of YES1 in 5 cases, 4 of which lacked any other known mechanisms of resistance. Pre-inhibitor samples, available for 2 of the 5 patients, lacked YES1 amplification. None of 136 post-inhibitor samples had detectable amplification of other Src family kinases (SRC, FYN). YES1 amplification was also found in 2 of 17 samples from ALK fusion-positive lung cancer patients who had progressed on ALK TKIs.

Lombardo","University of Cyprus","2018-03-17",2,"4","new results","neuroscience","Autism is a diagnostic label based on behavior. While the diagnostic criteria attempts to maximize clinical consensus, it also masks a wide degree of heterogeneity between and within individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Understanding this multi-level heterogeneity is of high clinical and translational importance. Here we present organizing principles to frame the work examining multi-level heterogeneity in autism. Theoretical concepts such as  spectrum or  autisms reflect non-mutually exclusive explanations regarding continuous/dimensional or categorical/qualitative variation between and within individuals. However, common practices of small sample size studies and case-control models are suboptimal for tackling heterogeneity. Big data is an important ingredient for furthering our understanding heterogeneity in autism. In addition to being  feature-rich, big data should be both  broad (i.e. large sample size) and  deep (i.e. multiple levels of data collected on the same individuals). These characteristics help ensure the results from a population are more generalizable and facilitate evaluation of the utility of different models of heterogeneity. A models utility can be shown by its ability to explain clinically or mechanistically important phenomena, but also by explaining how variability manifests across different levels of analysis. The directionality for explaining variability across levels can be bottom-up or top-down, and should include the importance of development for characterizing change within individuals. While progress can be made with  supervised models built upon a priori or theoretically predicted distinctions or dimensions of importance, it will become increasingly important to complement such work with unsupervised data-driven discoveries that leverage unknown and multivariate distinctions within big data. Without a better understanding of how to model heterogeneity between autistic people, progress towards the goal of precision medicine may be limited.","10.1038/s41380-018-0321-0"

Here we deconvolute a highly efficient cellulose-degrading consortium (SEM1b) that is co-dominated by Clostridium (Ruminiclostridium) thermocellum- and multiple heterogenic strains affiliated to C. proteolyticus. Metagenomic analysis of SEM1b recovered metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for each constituent population, whilst in parallel two novel strains of C. proteolyticus were successfully isolated and sequenced. Annotation of all C. proteolyticus genotypes (two strains and one MAG) revealed their genetic acquisition of various carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), presumably derived from horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events involving C. thermocellum- or Thermotogae-affiliated populations that are historically co-located. HGT material included whole saccharolytic operons and dockerin-encoding enzymatic subunits that are synonymous with cellulosomes. Finally, temporal genome-resolved metatranscriptomic analysis of SEM1b revealed expression of C. proteolyticus CAZymes at different SEM1b life-stages as well as co-expression of CAZymes from multiple SEM1b populations, inferring deeper microbial interactions that are dedicated towards co-degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose.

This is exploited in genotoxic chemotherapy where ICL induction is used to kill highly proliferative cancer cells. Repair of ICLs involves a complex interplay of numerous proteins, including those in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, though alternative and parallel pathways have been postulated. Here, we investigate the role of the 3-5 exonuclease, EXD2, and the highly related WRN exonuclease (implicated in premature ageing human Werner syndrome), in repair of interstrand crosslinks in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We find that flies mutant for EXD2 (DmEXD2) have elevated rates of genomic instability resulting from chromosome breakage and loss of the resulting acentric fragments, in contrast to WRN exonuclease (DmWRNexo) mutants where excess homologous recombination is the principal mechanism of genomic instability. Most notably, we demonstrate that proliferating larval neuroblasts mutant for either DmWRNexo or DmEXD2 are deficient in repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks caused by diepoxybutane or mitomycin C, strongly suggesting that each nuclease individually plays a role in repair of ICLs in flies.

At conception, zygotes inherit genes that regulate TL during early development, but at the same time already express a phenotype, which is the TL of the parental gametes that formed the zygote. Whether the effect of gamete TL is transient or affects TL for life depends on the extent to which regulatory genes compensate for gamete TL variation during early development. A carry-over effect of parental TL, resulting in epigenetic inheritance, has been suggested to explain the observed relationship between parental age and offspring TL in humans and other species. However, reports of parental age effects are based on cross-sectional data, and age at reproduction has numerous confounds. Furthermore, parental age may affect offspring telomere dynamics between conception and sampling, which could also explain the paternal age effect. Using longitudinal telomere data of jackdaw parents and their chicks, we show that chicks hatched with shorter telomeres as individual fathers aged, whereas mother age had no effect. By cross-fostering eggs, we confirmed the paternal age effect to be independent of paternal care after conception. The epigenetic effect accounted for 34% of the variance in offspring TL that was explained by paternal telomere length; the remaining 66% we ascribe to a combination of environmental and additive genetic effects. Thus, our results strongly indicate epigenetic inheritance of TL, with potential consequences for offspring fitness prospects.\n\nSignificance statementTelomeres are DNA-protein structures at chromosome ends and their length predicts remaining lifespan in humans and other organisms. Variation in telomere length is thought to be largely of genetic origin, but telomere inheritance may be unusual because a fertilised cell already has a telomere length (most traits are first expressed later in life). Telomeres shorten with age, and, using long-term individual-based data of jackdaw families, we show that as fathers aged, they produced chicks with shorter telomeres. This shows that paternal telomere length directly affects offspring telomere length, i.e. is inherited genetically but without the involvement of genes. This is known as an epigenetic effect and explained a large part ([&ge;]34%) of the telomere resemblance between fathers and their offspring.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007827"

Importantly, this system is also a highly applicable tool for aging studies.

We compared 41 unselected lines from the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS) population to 21 highly selected lines developed by modern commercial breeding programs and show that tassel size and weight were reduced significantly. We assayed genetic differences between the two groups using selection statistics XP-EHH, XP-CLR, and FST. All three selection statistics show evidence of selection at genomic regions associated with tassel morphology relative to genome-wide null distributions. These results support the tremendous effect, both phenotypic and genotypic, that selection has had on maize male inflorescence morphology.","10.1534/genetics.118.301487"

Because of the lifestyle of the original isolate, however, the nutritional repertoire of P. putida EM42 is centered largely on organic acids, aromatic compounds and some hexoses (glucose and fructose). To enlarge the biochemical network of P. putida EM42 to include disaccharides and pentoses, we implanted heterologous genetic modules for D-cellobiose and D-xylose metabolism into the enzymatic complement of this strain. Cellobiose was actively transported into the cells through the ABC complex formed by native proteins PP1015-PP1018. The knocked-in {beta}-glucosidase BglC from Thermobifida fusca catalyzed intracellular cleavage of the disaccharide to D-glucose, which was then channelled to the default central metabolism. Xylose oxidation to the dead end product D-xylonate was prevented by by deleting the gcd gene that encodes the broad substrate range quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase. Intracellular intake was then engineered by expressing the Escherichia coli proton-coupled symporter XylE. The sugar was further metabolized by the products of E. coli xylA (xylose isomerase) and xylB (xylulokinase) towards the pentose phosphate pathway. The resulting P. putida strain co-utilized xylose with glucose or cellobiose to complete depletion of the sugars. These results not only show the broadening of the metabolic capacity of a soil bacterium towards new substrates, but also promote P. putida EM42 as a platform for plug-in of new biochemical pathways for utilization and valorization of carbohydrate mixtures from lignocellulose processing.","10.1016/j.ymben.2018.05.019"

Here, we investigated the correlative associations among genome-wide features of introns from protein-coding genes (e.g., size, density, genome-content, repeats), genome size and multicellular complexity on 461 eukaryotes. Thus, we formally distinguished simple from complex multicellular organisms (CMOs), and developed the program GenomeContent to systematically estimate genomic traits. We performed robust phylogenetic controlled analyses, by taking into account significant uncertainties in the tree of eukaryotes and variation in genome size estimates. We found that changes in the variation of some intron features (such as size and repeat composition) are only weakly, while other features measuring intron abundance (within and across genes) are not, scaling with changes in genome size at the broadest phylogenetic scale. Accordingly, the strength of these associations fluctuates at the lineage-specific level, and changes in the length and abundance of introns within a genome are found to be largely evolving independently throughout Eukarya. Thereby, our findings are in disagreement with previous estimations claiming a concerted evolution between genome size and introns across eukaryotes. We also observe that intron features vary homogeneously (with low repetitive composition) within fungi, plants and stramenophiles; but they vary dramatically (with higher repetitive composition) within holozoans, chlorophytes, alveolates and amoebozoans. We also found that CMOs and their closest ancestral relatives are characterized by high intron-richness, regardless their genome size. These patterns contrast the narrow distribution of exon features found across eukaryotes. Collectively, our findings unveil spliceosomal introns as a dynamically evolving non-coding DNA class and strongly argue against both, a particular intron feature as key determinant of eukaryotic gene architecture, as well as a major mechanism (adaptive or non-adaptive) behind the evolutionary dynamics of introns over a large phylogenetic scale. We hypothesize that intron-richness is a pre-condition to evolve complex multicellularity.","NA"

We identify several putative horizontal transfer events, and examine the role that horizontal transfer plays in the spread of TE families to new species and the homogenization of TE content in these species. Despite rampant exchange of TE families between species, we find that both TE content differs hugely across the group, likely due to differing activity of each TE family and differing suppression of TEs due to divergence in Y chromosome size, and its resulting effects of TE regulation.

Given the mixed evidence for these predictions, we re-examined this hypothesis by training three groups of rats to lever press under ratio, interval and RPI schedules across two phases while matching reward rates within triads. At the end of the first phase, the master ratio and RPI groups responded at similar rates.

While thalamocortical inputs onto pyramidal neurons were depressed, there was stronger depression onto PV+ interneurons, which shifted the thalamocortical-evoked E-I ratio toward excitation.

Two of WT1s major isoforms are distinguished by the presence or absence of a 3 amino acid insert, Lysine-Threonine-Serine (KTS) in the linker between zinc-fingers 3 and 4. This KTS insert is conserved throughout all life forms expressing WT1.

In two independent studies (both n=24), we found that goal-directed eye movements activate a dorsal fronto-parietal network and transiently deactivate the amygdala. Connectivity analyses revealed this down-regulation engages a ventromedial prefrontal pathway known to be involved in cognitive regulation of emotion. Critically, when eye movements followed memory reactivation during extinction learning, this reduced spontaneous fear recovery 24 hours later. Stronger amygdala deactivation furthermore predicted a stronger reduction in subsequent fear recovery after reinstatement. In conclusion, we show that extinction learning can be improved with a non-invasive eye-movement intervention that triggers a transient suppression of the amygdala. Our finding that another task which taxes working memory leads to a similar amygdala suppression furthermore indicates that this effect is likely not specific to eye movements, which is in line with a large body of behavioral studies. This study contributes to the understanding of a widely used treatment for traumatic symptoms by providing a parsimonious account for how working memory tasks and goal-directed eye movements can enhance extinction-based psychotherapy, namely through neural circuits similar to those that support cognitive control of emotion.\n\nSignificant statementFear-related disorders represent a significant burden on individual sufferers and society. There is a high need to optimize treatment, in particular via non-invasive means. One potentially effective intervention is execution of eye movements following trauma recall. However, a neurobiological understanding of how eye movements can reduce traumatic symptoms is lacking. We demonstrate that goal-directed eye-movements, like working memory tasks, deactivate the amygdala, the core neural substrate of fear learning. Effective connectivity analyses revealed amygdala deactivation engaged dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal pathways. When applied during safety learning, this deactivation predicts a reduction in later fear recovery.

We now report an alternative mechanism for scaffolding that is necessary for RhoA-mediated contractile signaling. We find that anillin binding stabilizes active, GTP-RhoA, and promotes contractility at both the epithelial zonula adherens (ZA) and the cytokinetic furrow. However, anillin does not conform to the classical picture of a multi-domain tether, since its RhoA-binding AH domain alone was sufficient to promote contractile signaling. Moreover, anillin competes with contractile effectors for a common site on RhoA, presenting the conundrum of how an inhibitory interaction can otherwise promote signaling. To explain this, we propose that inactivation of RhoA is non-Poissonian, having a rate that increases with time, unless the process is reset via transient binding to anillin. Repeated cycles of binding and un-binding therefore increase cortical residence times of non-sequestered GTP-RhoA and hence the probability of engaging contractile effectors. We identify the modification of the local lipid environment as a potential mechanism underlying such non-Poisson statistics, and demonstrate agreement with a minimal cellular system. Finally, we show that Myosin II anchors anillin at the cortex to form a feedback pathway that enhances RhoA signaling. This new paradigm of scaffolding is a regulatory analogue of kinetic proofreading and may be employed by other binding proteins that do not fit the classical picture.","NA"

Here, we quantitatively identified several modes of state-unspecific individual variation in whole-brain functional connectivity patterns, called \""Common Neural Modes (CNMs)\"", from a large fMRI dataset including eight task/rest states, obtained from the Human Connectome Project. Furthermore, we tested how CNMs account for variability in individual behavioral measures. The results revealed that three CNMs were robustly extracted under various different preprocessing conditions. Each of these CNMs was significantly correlated with different aspects of behavioral measures of both fluid and crystalized intelligence. The three CNMs were also able to predict several life outcomes, such as income and life satisfaction, achieving the highest performance when combined with behavioral intelligence measures as inputs. Our findings highlight the importance of state-unspecific brain networks to characterize fundamental individual variation.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116036"

Most of these efforts have focused on mutations in protein-coding sequences. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) strongly suggests that variants important to human diseases often lie in non-coding regions. Extending DNM-based approaches to non-coding sequences is, however, challenging because the functional significance of non-coding mutations is difficult to predict. We propose a new statistical framework for analyzing DNMs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This method, TADA-Annotations (TADA-A), is a major advance of the TADA method we developed earlier for DNM analysis in coding regions. TADA-A is able to incorporate many functional annotations such as conservation and enhancer marks, learn from data which annotations are informative of pathogenic mutations and combine both coding and non-coding mutations at the gene level to detect risk genes. It also supports meta-analysis of multiple DNM studies, while adjusting for study-specific technical effects. We applied TADA-A to WGS data of [~]300 autism family trios across five studies, and discovered several new autism risk genes.

Understanding the current evolution of coat patterns requires reliably measuring traits, quantifying heritability of the traits, and identifying the fitness consequences of specific phenotypes. Giraffe coat markings are highly variable and it has been hypothesized that variation in coat patterns most likely affects fitness by camouflaging neonates against predators. We quantified spot pattern traits of wild Masai giraffes using image analysis software, determined whether spot pattern traits were heritable, and assessed whether variation in heritable spot pattern traits was related to fitness as measured by juvenile survival. The methods we described comprise a framework for objective quantification of mammalian coat pattern traits based on photographic coat pattern data. We demonstrated that characteristics of giraffe coat spot shape are heritable. We did not find evidence for juvenile survival consequences of variation in spot traits, suggesting that spot traits are currently not under strong directional, disruptive, or stabilizing selection for neonate camouflage in our study population, but our sample size could not detect small differences in survival. Spot trait variation also may be more relevant to other components of fitness, such as adult survival or fecundity. We hope this case study will inspire further investigations of coat pattern traits.","10.7717/peerj.5690"

The degree of salt concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct equilibrium statistics for an ({Delta}{micro}, N, p, T) ensemble.

WT1 binds DNA using it C-terminal domain made up of 4 C2H2-typ zinc fingers. This same zinc finger domain is used to bind RNA and proteins and it is still not clear how each zinc finger contributes to this promiscuous binding behavior. The molecular details of DNA binding by zinc finger 2 to 4 have been described but it remains to be determined whether or not zinc finger 1 binds DNA and if so whether it exhibits any DNA binding specificity. We present the X-ray structures of zinc finger 1 to 3 bound to a 9 bp and an 8 bp DNA. The two structures refined to 1.7 [A], show no DNA binding specificity for zinc finger 1. The only DNA interactions involving zinc finger 1 are crystal-packing interactions with a symmetry related molecule.

It also required participants to switch their attention between feature dimensions on a trial-by-trial basis, thus taxing executive processes. Furthermore, we used a response paradigm that captured task-irrelevant motor output (TIMO), reflecting failures to use the correct stimulus-response rule. ADHD participants had substantially higher perceptual variability than Controls, especially for orientation, as well as higher TIMO. In both ADHD and Controls, TIMO was strongly affected by the switch manipulation. Across participants, the perceptual variability parameter was correlated with TIMO, suggesting that perceptual deficits are associated with executive function deficits. Based on perceptual variability alone, we were able to classify participants into ADHD and Controls with a mean accuracy of about 77%.

TEs themselves evolve, with clade specific LTR/ERV, LINEs and SINEs responsible for the bulk of species specific genomic features. Because TEs can contain regulatory motifs, they can be exapted as regulators of gene expression. While TE insertions can provide evolutionary novelty for the regulation of gene expression, their overall impact on the evolution of gene expression is unclear. Previous investigators have shown that tissue specific gene expression in amniotes is more similar across species than within species, supporting the existence of conserved developmental gene regulation. In order to understand how species specific TE insertions might affect the evolution/conservation of gene expression, we have looked at the association of gene expression in six tissues with TE insertions in six representative amniote genomes (human, opossum, platypus, anole lizard, bearded dragon and chicken).\n\nResultsWe have used a novel bootstrapping approach to minimise the conflation of effects of repeat types on gene expression. We compared the expression of orthologs containing different types of recent TE insertions to orthologs that contained older TE insertions and found significant differences in gene expression associated with TE insertions. Likewise, we compared the expression of non-ortholog genes containing different types of recent TE insertions to non-orthologs with older TE insertions and found significant differences in gene expression associated with TE insertions. As expected TEs were associated with species-specific changes in gene expression, but the magnitude and direction of change of expression changes were unexpected. Overall, orthologs containing clade specific TEs were associated with lower gene expression, while in non-orthologs, non clade-specific TEs were associated with higher gene expression. Exceptions were SINE elements in human and chicken, which had an opposite association with gene expression compared to other species.\n\nConclusionsOur observed species-specific associations of TEs with gene expression support a role for TEs in speciation/response to selection by species. TEs do not exhibit consistent associations with gene expression and observed associations can vary depending on the age of TE insertions. Based on these observations, it would be prudent to refrain from extrapolating these and previously reported associations to distantly related species.","10.1186/s13100-018-0124-5"

Multiple thalamic nuclei send convergent information to each region of the forebrain, but whether there is a conserved architecture across the set of thalamic pathways projecting to each forebrain area has remained unresolved3-5. To uncover organizational principles of thalamic pathways, we produced a near-comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of thalamus. This revealed a common logic for thalamic nuclei serving all major cortical modalities. We found that almost all nuclei belong to one of three major profiles, with a given cortical area getting input from each of these profiles. These profiles lie on a single axis of variance aligned with the mediolateral axis of thalamus, and this axis is strongly enriched in genes encoding receptors and ion channels. We further show that each projection profile exhibits different electrophysiological signatures. Single-cell profiling revealed that rather than forming discrete classes, thalamic neurons lie on a spectrum, with intermediate cells existing between profiles. Thus, in contrast to canonical models of thalamus that suggest it is a switchboard primarily concerned with routing distinct modalities of information to distinct cortical regions, we show that the thalamocortical system is more akin to a molecularly-defined  filter bank repeatedly applied across modality. Together, we reveal striking covariation in the organization of thalamic pathways serving all input modalities and output targets, establishing a simple and comprehensive thalamic functional architecture.","NA"

We identify several putative horizontal transfer events, and examine the role that horizontal transfer plays in the spread of TE families to new species and the homogenization of TE content in these species. Despite rampant exchange of TE families between species, we find that both TE content differs hugely across the group, likely due to differing activity of each TE family and differing suppression of TEs due to divergence in Y chromosome size, and its resulting effects of TE regulation.

The result of these signalling events is to rapidly modulate synapse structure and function, as well as epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications. Ultimately these mechanisms are thought to contribute to long-lasting changes in neural circuitry, and thus influences cognitive functions such as learning and memory. However, the mechanisms by which estrogen-mediated local synaptic and nuclear signalling events are coordinated are not well understood. In this study we have found that the scaffold protein afadin, (also known as AF-6), undergoes a bi-directional trafficking to both synaptic and nuclear compartment in response to acute 17{beta}-estradiol (estradiol) treatment. Interestingly, nuclear accumulation of afadin was coincidental with an increase in the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (H3S10p). This histone modification is associated with the remodelling of chromatin into an open euchromatin state, allowing for transcriptional activation and related learning and memory processes. Critically, the cyto-nuclear trafficking of afadin was required for estradiol-dependent H3S10p. We further determined that nuclear accumulation of afadin is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of the mitogentic kinases ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) within the nucleus. Moreover, nuclear pERK1/2 was required for estradiol-dependent H3S10p. Taken together, we propose a model whereby estradiol incudes the bi-directional trafficking of afadin to synaptic and nuclear sub-compartments. Within the nucleus, afadin is required for increased pERK1/2 which in turn is required for H3S10p. Therefore this represents a mechanism through which estrogens may be able to coordinate both synaptic and nucleosomal events within the same neuronal population.","10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.09.041"

In genetic bandwagoning, a bandwagoning allele evaluates the outlook for lineage fitness of the individual holding the allele. If its holders lineage fitness figures to be low, the bandwagoning allele induces its holder to relinquish some, or all, of the holders own resources (e.g., food, territory, mates), which are then used by individuals that happen to be nearby. While some nearby individuals may not possess a copy of the bandwagoning allele, it is likely, if assortment is sufficiently positive, that numerous individuals do and most of those that do have a better lineage fitness outlook than that of the individual that was induced to forfeit the resources, since the inducement is contingent upon a poor lineage fitness outlook. Due to their better lineage fitness outlook, the nearby individuals make better usage of the resources than the forfeiting individuals would have and the ratio between the quantity of descendants nearby individuals produce with the resources and the quantity of descendants that would have been produced by the forfeiting individuals tends to increase with each generation due to multiple reasons examined in section 2. If assortment is sufficiently positive, more copies of the allele are produced over the ensuing generations than if the resources had not been forfeited, as the allele is selected by \""jumping on the bandwagon\"" of these fit lineages that use the resources.\n\nTwo ways to bandwagon are introduced: resonation and reservation. In resonation, the bandwagoning allele accomplishes the two steps of bandwagoning--1) evaluating its holders lineage fitness outlook and 2) inducing a holder with a low (i.e., poor) outlook to relinquish resources--sequentially. The necessity for reservation occurs because a lineages fitness outlook can depend upon aspects of quality which are difficult to evaluate during a generation in which many individuals are able to avoid death or serious harm. In reservation, a bandwagoning allele solves this problem of evaluating quality by inducing its holder to reserve from (i.e., withhold) some of its ability to survive against one or more natural enemies, particularly predators or parasites: An individual that can remain healthy in spite of reserving from its ability to survive predators or parasites is likely to have genes that enable its descendants to survive when the predator or parasite threat is more severe; however, if the individual perishes or becomes sick as a result of reservation, its lineage fitness outlook is determined to be low and the relinquishment of resources occurs with this same perishing or sickness. That is, the individuals perishing or sickness due to reservation serves simultaneously: 1) to identify that individual as having a low lineage fitness outlook and 2) as the source of relinquishing the individuals resources on the basis of this low lineage fitness outlook.\n\nGenetic bandwagoning constitutes a novel mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Numerous paradoxes can be explained by the actions of bandwagoning alleles that use a combination of resonation and reservation, including the phenotypic cooccurrences of robust defenses against parasites and depressive symptoms; phenotypic cooccurrences of robust defenses against parasites and photosynthetic costs; phenotypic cooccurrences of susceptibility to parasites and androgenic benefits; the maintenance of honest signals when there are opportunities to cheat; the forfeiture of reproductive opportunities by functionally capable individuals; and the differential nurturing of offspring.","NA"

Activation of these immune receptors typically results in activation of the immune system and subsequent suppression of pathogen proliferation. Although many examples of NLR receptors are known, a mechanistic understanding of how receptor activation ultimately leads to an immune response is not well understood. A subset of the NLR proteins contain a TIR domain at their N terminus (TNL). One such TNL, the N gene, was previously shown to depend on a non-TIR NLR protein, N requirement gene 1 (NRG1) for immune function. We tested additional NLR proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana for dependency on NRG1. We found that two additional TIR-NLR proteins, Roq1 and RPP1, also require NRG1 but that two coiled-coil NLR proteins, Bs2 and Rps2, do not. This finding suggests that NRG1 may be a conserved component of TNL signaling pathways.","NA"

Thus, we evaluated the virtual screening performance of homology models of human GPCRs with respect to the corresponding crystal structures. Among the 19 GPCRs involved in this study, we observed that 10 GPCRs have homology models that have better or comparable performance with respect to the corresponding X-ray structures, making homology models a viable choice for virtual screening. For a small subset of GPCRs, we also explored how certain methods like consensus enrichment and sidechain perturbation affect the utility of homology models in virtual screening, as well as the selectivity between agonists and antagonists. Most notably, consensus enrichment across multiple homology models often yields results comparable to the best performing model, suggesting that ligand candidates predicted with consensus scores from multiple models can be the optimal option in practical applications where the performance of each model cannot be estimated.","10.1002/prot.25533"

Using simple experimental data extracted from complex experimental images, we estimate three model parameters:(i) the melanoma cell proliferation rate,{lambda} ; (ii) the melanoma cell diffusivity, D; and (iii){delta} , a constant that determines the rate that melanoma cells degrade the skin tissue. The Bayesian sequential learning frame-work involves a sequence of increasingly-sophisticated experimental data from:(i) a spatially uniform cell proliferation assay; (ii) a two-dimensional circular barrier assay; and, (iii) a three-dimensional invasion assay. The Bayesian sequential learning approach leads to well-defined parameter estimates. In contrast, taking a naive approach that attempts to estimate all parameters from a single set of images from the same experiment fails to produce meaningful results. Overall our approach to inference is simple-to-implement, computationally efficient, and well-suited for many cell biology phenomena that can be described by low dimensional continuum models using ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. We anticipate that this Bayesian sequential learning framework will be relevant in other biological contexts where it is challenging to extract detailed, quantitative biological measurements from experimental images and so we must rely on using relatively simple measurements from complex images.","10.1007/s11538-018-0532-1"

The Bayesian brain hypothesis, predictive coding, the free energy principle and active inference are increasingly popular theories of cognitive functions that claim to unify understandings of life and cognition within general mathematical frameworks derived from information theory, statistical physics and machine learning. Furthermore, it has been argued that one such proposal, active inference, combines both information and control theory and has its roots in cybernetics studies of the brain. The connections between information and control theory have been discussed since the 1950s by scientists like Shannon and Kalman and have recently risen to prominence in modern stochastic optimal control theory. How-ever, the implications of the confluence of these two theoretical frame-works for the biological sciences have been slow to emerge. Here we argue that if the active inference proposal is to be taken as a general process theory for biological systems, we need to consider how existing control theoretical approaches to biological systems relate to it. In this work we will focus on PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers, one of the most common types of regulators employed in engineering and more recently used to explain behaviour in biological systems, e.g. chemotaxis in bacteria and amoebae or robust adaptation in biochemical networks. Using active inference, we derive a probabilistic interpretation of PID controllers, showing how they can fit a more general theory of life and cognition under the principle of (variational) free energy minimisation once we use only simple linear generative models.","NA"

It performs alignments using BFAST, leveraging its multithreading functionality and thorough hash-based indexing strategy. BisPin is feature rich and supports directional, nondirectional, PBAT, and hairpin construction strategies. BisPin approaches read mapping by converting the Cs to Ts and the Gs to As in both the reads and the reference genome. BisPin uses fast rescoring to disambiguate ambiguously aligned reads for a superior amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers. The performance of BisPin was evaluated on both real and simulated data in comparison to other read mappers.\n\nBFAST-Gap is a modified version of BFAST meant for Ion Torrent reads. It uses a parameterized logistic function to determine the weights of the gap open and extension penalties based on the homopolymer run length of the DNA read. This is because the Ion Torrent sequencing technology can overcall and undercall homopolymer runs. BisPin works with both BFAST-Gap and BFAST. BFAST-Gap is compatible with indexes built with BFAST. There are few mappers that specifically address Ion Torrent data. BFAST-Gap works with Illumina reads as well.\n\nResultsBisPin with BFAST consistently had a higher amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers on real data using a variety of construction strategies. Using a hairpin validation strategy, BisPin was superior using the maximum score, and it mapped 73% of reads correctly.\n\nBisPin with BFAST-Gap on Ion Torrent reads with a logistic gap open penalty function improved mapping accuracy with real and simulated data. On simulated bisulfite Ion Torrent data, the area under the curve was improved by approximately seven, and on one real data set, the uniquely mapped percent was improved by seven percent. BFAST-Gap performed better than TMAP on simulated regular Ion Torrent reads, and TMAP is designed for Ion Torrent reads. Other read mappers had worse performance.\n\nConclusionsBisPin and BFAST-Gap have consistently good accuracy with a variety of data. BisPin is feature-rich.

However, footprinting and the impact of sequence bias have not been extensively studied for ATAC-seq. Here, we undertake a systematic comparison of the two methods and show that a modification to the ATAC-seq protocol increases its yield and its agreement with DNase-seq data from the same cell line. We demonstrate that the two methods have distinct sequence biases and correct for these protocol-specific biases when performing footprinting. Despite differences in footprint shapes, the locations of the inferred footprints in ATAC-seq and DNase-seq are largely concordant.

RNAi in non-bilaterians - sponges, ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians - appears to be more diverse than that of bilaterians, and includes structurally variable miR-NAs in sponges, an enormous number of piRNAs in cnidarians and the absence of miRNAs in ctenophores and placozoans.\n\nResultsHere we identify thousands of endo-siRNAs and piRNAs from the sponge Amphimedon queens-landica, the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi and the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis using a computational approach that clusters mapped small RNA sequences and annotates each cluster based on the read length and relative abundance of the constituent reads. This approach was validated on 11 small RNA libraries in Drosophila melanogaster, demonstrating the successful annotation of RNAi associated loci with properties consistent with previous reports. In the non-bilaterians we uncover seven new miRNAs from Amphimedon and four from Nematostella as well as sub-populations of candidate cis-natural antisense transcript (cis-NAT) endo-siRNAs. In the ctenophore, the absence of miRNAs is confirmed and an abundance of endo-siRNAs is revealed. Analysis of putative piRNA structure suggests that conserved localised secondary structures in primary transcripts may be important for the production of mature piRNAs in Amphimedon and Nematostella, as is also the case for endo-siRNAs.\n\nConclusionTogether, these findings suggest that the last common ancestor of animals did not have the entrained RNAi system that typifies bilaterians.

Imaging data provide quantitative information about biological systems, however, mechanisms causing spatial patterning often remain illusive. In recent years, spatio-temporal mathematical modelling helped to overcome this problem. Yet, outliers and structured noise limit modelling of whole imaging data, and models often consider spatial summary statistics. Here, we introduce an integrated data-driven modelling approach that can cope with measurement artefacts and whole imaging data. Our approach combines mechanistic models of the biological processes with robust statistical models of the measurement process. The parameters of the integrated model are calibrated using a maximum likelihood approach. We used this integrated modelling approach to study in vivo gradients of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21). CCL21 gradients guide dendritic cells and are important in the adaptive immune response. Using artificial data, we verified that the integrated modelling approach provides reliable parameter estimates in the presence of measurement noise and that bias and variance of these estimates are reduced compared to conventional approaches. The application to experimental data allowed the parameterisation and subsequent refinement of the model using additional mechanisms. Among others, model-based hypothesis testing predicted lymphatic vessel dependent concentration of heparan sulfate, the binding partner of CCL21. The selected model provided an accurate description of the experimental data and was partially validated using published data. Our findings demonstrate that integrated statistical modelling of whole imaging data is computationally feasible and can provide novel biological insights.","10.1098/rsif.2018.0600"

Here we used optogenetics to probe feedforward thalamocortical and feedback intracortical excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratios following brief MD. While thalamocortical inputs onto pyramidal neurons were depressed, there was stronger depression onto PV+ interneurons, which shifted the thalamocortical-evoked E-I ratio toward excitation. In contrast, feedback intracortical E-I ratio was shifted toward inhibition, and a computational model of layer 4 demonstrated that these opposing shifts produced an overall suppression of layer 4 excitability.

Tau hyperphosphorylation may result from the downregulation of phosphatases, especially protein phosphatase 2A. In an attempt to model and analyze these molecular events we treated SH-SY5Y cells with okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. In addition to the low molecular weight tau, such treatment lead to the appearance of heat-stable protein species with apparent high molecular weight around 100 kDa, which were immunoreactive to tau antibodies against phosphorylated Ser202 and phosphorylated Ser396. Based on the observation that high molecular weight tau-immunoreactive proteins (HMW-TIP) correspond to the predicted size of two monomers of tau, one possibility is that HMW-TIP represent tau oligomers. The absence of HMW-TIP detection by anti-total tau antibodies used may be a consequence of epitope masking, or a combination of epitope masking and protein truncation. We noted the stability of HMW-TIP in the presence of strong denaturing agents, such as urea and guanidine, as well as upon partial dephosphorylation by the alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, as HMW-TIP did not dissociate the presence of {beta}-mercaptoethanol, it was also independent from disulfide bonds. Taken together, these data show that OA treatment of SH-SY5Y cells induces the appearance of HMW-TIP, which may represent tau oligomer or tau-crossreactive phospho-proteins. Our findings have implications for further studies of tau under the conditions of protein phosphatase downregulation.","10.1016/j.jneumeth.2018.09.030"

In these pathologies, iterative cycles of damage and repair result in the development of a regenerative microenvironment surrounding the bile ducts, which orchestrates both epithelial proliferation and also biliary fibrosis. Ultimately, fibrosis at the cost of repair results in cholestasis and liver failure, necessitating liver transplantation. Whilst the fibrogenic mechanisms in hepatocellular disease have been widely studied, little is known about the processes that regulate biliary scarring. We sought to determine how the injured biliary epithelium communicates to adjacent stromal cells to regulate scar formation, and to identify therapeutically targetable pathways that could be inhibited to reduce biliary scarring, whilst maintaining the pro-regenerative stroma. Using human tissue, bile duct organoids and animal models of biliary disease, we show that non-canonical Wnt signalling is important in initiating biliary scarring. This process is driven by myeloid Wnt5a and acts through epithelial Vangl2, which is upstream of Jnk/cJun signalling. Activation of this pathway drives a pro-fibrotic signalling process which instructs portal fibroblasts to synthesise collagen. Finally, we determine that therapeutic Wnt ligand inhibition reduces biliary scarring, identifying non-canonical Wnt signalling as a novel target for anti-fibrotic therapy in cholestatic biliary disease.","NA"

However, existing studies had shown that frameshift genes/proteins are widely existing and sometimes functional. It is puzzling how a frameshift kept its structure and functionality while its amino-acid sequence is changed substantially. Here we demonstrate that the protein sequences of the frameshifts are highly conservative when compared with the wild-type protein sequence, and the similarities among the three protein sequences encoded in the three reading frames of a coding gene are defined mainly by the genetic code. In the standard genetic code, amino acid substitutions assigned to frameshift codon substitutions are far more conservative than those assigned to random substitutions. The frameshift tolerability of the standard genetic code ranks in the top 1.0-5.0% of all possible genetic codes, showing that the genetic code is optimal in terms of frameshift tolerance. In some higher species, the shiftability is further optimized at gene- or genome-level by a biased usage of codons and codon pairs, in which frameshift-tolerable codons/codon pairs are overrepresented in their genomes.","NA"

Here, we evaluated whether this phenotypic correlation between immune diseases and schizophrenia might be explained by shared genetic risk factors (genetic correlation). We used data from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia (N=35,476 cases and 46,839 controls) to compare the genetic architecture of schizophrenia to 19 immune diseases. First, we evaluated the association with schizophrenia of 581 variants previously reported to be associated with immune diseases at genome-wide significance. We identified three variants with pleiotropic effects, located in regions associated with both schizophrenia and immune disease. Our analyses provided the strongest evidence of pleiotropy at rs1734907 ([~]85kb upstream of EPHB4), a variant which was associated with increased risk of both Crohns disease (OR = 1.16, P = 1.67x10-13) and schizophrenia (OR = 1.07, P = 7.55x10-6). Next, we investigated genome-wide sharing of common variants between schizophrenia and immune diseases using polygenic risk scores (PRS) and cross-trait LD Score regression (LDSC). PRS revealed significant genetic overlap with schizophrenia for narcolepsy (p=4.1x10-4), primary biliary cirrhosis (p=1.4x10-8), psoriasis (p=3.6x10-5), systemic lupus erythematosus (p=2.2x10-8), and ulcerative colitis (p=4.3x10-4). Genetic correlations between these immune diseases and schizophrenia, estimated using LDSC, ranged from 0.10 to 0.18 and were consistent with the expected phenotypic correlation based on epidemiological data. We also observed suggestive evidence of sex-dependent genetic correlation between schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis (interaction p=0.02), with genetic risk scores for multiple sclerosis associated with greater risk of schizophrenia among males but not females. Our findings suggest that shared genetic risk factors contribute to the epidemiological co-occurrence of schizophrenia and certain immune diseases, and suggest that in some cases this genetic correlation is sex-dependent.

Author SummaryImmune diseases occur at different rates among patients with schizophrenia compared to the general population. While the reasons for this phenotypic correlation are unclear, shared genetic risk (genetic correlation) has been proposed as a contributing factor. Prior studies have estimated the genetic correlation between schizophrenia and a handful of immune diseases, with conflicting results. Here, we performed a comprehensive cross-disorder investigation of schizophrenia and 19 immune diseases. We identified three individual genetic variants associated with both schizophrenia and immune diseases, including a variant near EPHB4 - a gene whose protein product guides the migration of lymphocytes towards infected cells in the immune system and the migration of neuronal axons in the brain. We demonstrated significant genome-wide genetic correlation between schizophrenia and narcolepsy, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ulcerative colitis. Finally, we identified a potential sex-dependent pleiotropic effect between schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. Our findings point to shared genetic risk for schizophrenia and at least a subset of immune diseases, which likely contributes to their epidemiological co-occurrence. These results raise the possibility that the same genetic variants may exert their effects on neurons or immune cells to influence the development of psychiatric and immune disorders, respectively.","NA"

In recent years, key computational models have conceptualized habits as arising from model-free reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, which typically select between available actions based on the future value expected to result from each. Traditionally, however, habits have been understood as behaviors that can be triggered directly by a stimulus, without requiring the animal to evaluate expected outcomes. Here, we develop a computational model instantiating this traditional view, in which habits develop through the direct strengthening of recently taken actions rather than through the encoding of outcomes. We demonstrate that this model accounts for key behavioral manifestations of habits, including insensitivity to outcome devaluation and contingency degradation, as well as the effects of reinforcement schedule on the rate of habit formation. The model also explains the prevalent observation of perseveration in repeated-choice tasks as an additional behavioral manifestation of the habit system. We suggest that mapping habitual behaviors onto value-free mechanisms provides a parsimonious account of existing behavioral and neural data.

Appling empirical dynamic modelling that acknowledges nonlinear dynamics on nine subpopulations of tiger mosquitos from three neighbouring reef islets of the Raiatea atoll, we identified temperature, precipitation, dew point, air pressure, and mean tide level as causal environmental variables. Interestingly, responses of subpopulations in close proximity (100-500 m) differed with respect to their causal environmental variables and the time delay of effect, highlighting complexity in mosquito-environment causality network. Moreover, we demonstrated how to explore the effects of changing environmental variables on number and strength of mosquito outbreaks, providing a new framework for pest control and disease vector ecology.","NA"

Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells (Treg) require TCR signals for their suppressive function and maintenance in the periphery. It is, however, unclear how TCR signalling controls the transcriptional programme of Treg. Since most of studies identified the transcriptional features of Treg in comparison to naive T cells, the relationship between Treg and non-naive T cells including memory-phenotype T cells (Tmem) and effector T cells (Teff) is not well understood. Here we dissect the transcriptomes of various T cell subsets from independent datasets using the multidimensional analysis method Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). We show that resting Treg share gene modules for activation with Tmem and Teff. Importantly, Tmem activate the distinct transcriptional modules for T cell activation, which are uniquely repressed in Treg. The activation signature of Treg is dependent on TCR signals, and is more actively operating in activated Treg. Furthermore, by analysing single cell RNA-seq data from tumour-infiltrating T cells, we revealed that FOXP3 expression occurs predominantly in activated T cells. Moreover, we identified FOXP3-driven and T follicular helper (Tfh)-like differentiation pathways in tumour microenvironments, and their bifurcation point, which is enriched with recently activated T cells. Collectively, our study reveals the activation mechanisms downstream of TCR signals for the bifurcation of Treg and Teff differentiation and their maturation processes.","10.3389/fimmu.2018.01444"

Early studies suggested a network of amygdala, limbic regions and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) involved in fear processing. Excitability regulation in the dmPFC might be crucial for physiological fear processing, while an abnormal excitability pattern could lead to mental illness. Non-invasive paradigms to measure excitability regulation during fear processing in humans are missing.\n\nMethodsWe adapted an experimental approach of excitability characterization using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dmPFC during an instructed fear paradigm to dynamically dissect its role in fear processing. Event-related (ERP) and TMS-evoked potentials (TEP) were analyzed to trace dmPFC excitability in healthy young volunteers (n = 40, age = 27.6 {+/-} 5.7 years, 22 females). Moreover, we linked the excitability regulation patterns to individual structural MRI-derived properties of gray matter microstructural integrity of the fear network.\n\nResultsAn increased cortical excitability was demonstrated in the threat (T) condition in comparison to no-threat (NT) as showed by increased amplitude of evoked potentials. Furthermore, TMS over the dmPFC induced markedly increased evoked responses during T condition in relation to NT. Moreover, we found that the structural integrity of the dmPFC and the amygdala predict excitability regulation patterns as measured by ERP and TEP during fear processing.\n\nConclusionsWe describe the dynamic range of excitability regulation in dmPFC during fear processing.

Its potential for use in QTL mapping has been described previously, but it remains underutilized, with certain key advantages undemonstrated until now. In the first case study, we use mean-variance QTL mapping to reanalyze a reduced complexity intercross of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice examining circadian behavior and find a mean-controlling QTL for circadian wheel running activity that was not detected by traditional interval mapping. Mean-variance QTL mapping was more powerful than traditional interval mapping at the QTL because it accounted for the fact that mice homozygous for the C57BL/6N allele had less residual variance than the other mice. In the second case study, we reanalyze an intercross between C57BL/6J and C58/J mice examining anxiety-like behaviors, and identify a variance-controlling QTL for rearing behavior.

Consistent with an important role in this process, HECATE (HEC) bHLH transcription factors display diverse functions, from photomorphogenesis to the control of shoot meristem dynamics and gynoecium patterning. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their functional versatility and the deployment of specific HEC sub-programs still remain elusive.\n\nTo address this issue, we systematically identified proteins with the capacity to interact with HEC1, the best characterized member of the family, and integrated this information with our data set of direct HEC1 target genes. The resulting core genetic modules were consistent with specific developmental functions of HEC1, including its described activities in light signalling, gynoecium development and auxin homeostasis. Importantly, we found that in addition, HEC genes play a role in the modulation of flowering time and uncovered that their role in gynoecium development may involve the direct transcriptional regulation of NGATHA1 (NGA1) and NGA2 genes. NGA factors were previously shown to contribute to fruit development, but our data now show that they also modulate stem cell homeostasis in the SAM.\n\nTaken together, our results suggest a molecular network underlying the functional versatility of HEC transcription factors. Our analyses have not only allowed us to identify relevant target genes controlling shoot stem cell activity and a so far undescribed biological function of HEC1, but also provide a rich resource for the mechanistic elucidation of further context dependent HEC activities.\n\nSignificance statementAlthough many transcription factors display diverse regulatory functions during plant development, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains poor.

For ectothermic species with broad geographical distributions, latitudinal/altitudinal variation in environmental temperatures (averages and extremes) are expected to shape the evolution of physiological tolerances and the acclimation capacity (i.e., degree of phenotypic plasticity) of natural populations. This can create geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favour individuals that maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural selection targets this trait in natural populations. Here we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge by measuring survival, through mark recapture integrated into an information-theoretic approach, as a function of the plasticity of critical thermal limits for activity, behavioural thermal preference and the thermal sensitivity of metabolism in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog Pleurodema thaul. Overall, our results indicate that thermal acclimation in this population is not being targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models, survival decreased in individuals with less tolerance to cold when cold-acclimated (probably because daily low extremes are frequent during the cooler periods of the year) and increased with body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates were non-significant.","10.1111/eva.12702"

However, many sensors suffer from poor accuracy in estimating impact kinematics and count, motivating the need for additional independent impact exposure quantification for comparison. Here, we equipped seven collegiate American football players with instrumented mouthguards, and video recorded practices and games to compare video-based and sensor-based exposure rates and impact location distributions. Over 50 player-hours, we identified 271 helmet contact periods in video, while the instrumented mouthguard sensor recorded 2,032 discrete head impacts. Matching video and mouthguard real-time stamps yielded 193 video-identified helmet contact periods and 217 sensor-recorded impacts. To compare impact locations, we binned matched impacts into frontal, rear, side, oblique, and top locations based on video observations and sensor kinematics. While both video-based and sensor-based methods found similar location distributions, our best method utilizing integrated linear and angular position only correctly predicted 81 of 217 impacts. Finally, based on the activity timeline from video assessment, we also developed a new exposure metric unique to American football quantifying number of cross-verified sensor impacts per player-play. We found significantly higher exposure during games (0.35, 95% CI: 0.29-0.42) than practices (0.20, 95% CI: 0.17-0.23) (p<0.05). In the traditional impacts per player-hour metric, we observed higher exposure during practices (4.7) than games (3.7) due to increased player activity in practices.

However, its estimates of SNP heritability are derived from an unrealistic model in which each SNP is expected to contribute equal heritability. As a consequence, LDSC tends to over-estimate confounding bias, under-estimate the total phenotypic variation explained by SNPs, and provide misleading estimates of the heritability enrichment of SNP categories. Therefore, we present SumHer, software for estimating SNP heritability from summary statistics using more realistic heritability models. After demonstrating its superiority over LDSC, we apply SumHer to the results of 24 large-scale association studies (average sample size 121 000). First we show that these studies have tended to substantially over-correct for confounding, and as a result the number of genome-wide significant loci has under-reported by about 20%. Next we estimate enrichment for 24 categories of SNPs defined by functional annotations. A previous study using LDSC reported that conserved regions were 13-fold enriched, and found a further twelve categories with above 2-fold enrichment. By contrast, our analysis using SumHer finds that conserved regions are only 1.6-fold (SD 0.06) enriched, and that no category has enrichment above 1.7-fold. SumHer provides an improved understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits, which enables more efficient analysis of future genetic data.","10.1038/s41588-018-0279-5"

Similar deformities have now been recorded in dozens of species of birds across multiple continents. Despite this, the etiology of AKD has remained elusive, making it difficult to assess the impacts of this disease on wild populations. We previously identified an association between infection with a novel picornavirus, Poecivirus, and AKD in a small cohort of black-capped chickadees.\n\nMethodsTo test if the association between Poecivirus and AKD holds in a lager study population, we used targeted PCR followed by Sanger sequencing to screen 124 symptomatic and asymptomatic black-capped chickadees for Poecivirus infection. We further compared the efficacy of multiple non-terminal field sampling methods (buccal swabs, cloacal swabs, fecal samples, and blood samples) for Poecivirus screening. Finally, we used both in situ hybridization and a strand-specific expression assay to localize Poecivirus to beak tissue of AKD-positive individuals and to determine if virus is actively replicating in beak tissue.\n\nResultsPoecivirus was detected in 29/29 (100%) individuals with AKD, but only 9/95 (9.5%) asymptomatic individuals with apparently normal beaks (p < 0.0001). We found that cloacal swabs are the most sensitive of these sample types for detecting Poecivirus in birds with AKD, but that buccal swabs should be combined with cloacal swabs in evaluating the infection status of asymptomatic birds. Finally, we used both in situ hybridization and a strand-specific expression assay to localize Poecivirus to beak tissue of AKD-positive individuals and to provide evidence of active viral replication.\n\nConclusionThe data presented here show a strong, statistically significant relationship between Poecivirus infection and AKD, and provide evidence that Poecivirus is indeed an avian virus, infecting and actively replicating in beak tissue of AKD-affected BCCH. Taken together, these data corroborate and extend the evidence for a potential causal association between Poecivirus and AKD in the black-capped chickadee.

Reverse mutations, which restore the wild-type phenotype of a mutant, have been assumed to be far rarer than a forward mutation. However, in this study, screening tests in E. coli showed that the revertants of a frameshift mutation are detected more frequently than expected. Sanger and NGS sequencing of the plasmids revealed that the reversion of the frameshift mutation is not likely caused by random mutagenesis but by an active and targeted gene repair. Molecular studies suggest that premature termination codons (PTCs) in the nonsense mRNAs signal the repair of the frameshift mutation. Genome resequencing indicates that the proofreading/mismatch repair system of the revertant is not defective but active. Transcriptome profiling identified upregulated genes/pathways involved in the frameshift repair, including DNA replication, RNA processing, RNA editing, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination. Based on these data and a review of previous studies, we hypothesized a model for frameshift repair, referred to as nonsense-mediated gene repair (NMGR). In essence, nonsense mRNAs are recognized, edited by RNA editing, and then used to direct the repair of their defective coding DNA sequence through mismatch repair and homologous recombination. Moreover, NMGR may also serve as a driving force for molecular evolution, and a new source of genetic diversity leads to the widespread existence of frameshift homologs.","NA"

We obtained a 98%-complete genome of this low-abundance species, Candidatus Desulfosporosinus infrequens, by metagenomics. To test for environmentally relevant metabolic activity of Ca.

Compared to the no-substrate control, transcriptional activity of Ca. D. infrequens increased 56- to 188-fold in incubations with sulfate and acetate, propionate, lactate, or butyrate, revealing a versatile substrate use. Cellular activation was due to a significant overexpression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and carbon-degradation pathways, but not of genes encoding DNA or cell replication.

We further describe the genome and transcriptome of Ca. N. brevis str. U25, a new strain capable of urea utilization. Ammonia limitation in CN25 resulted in reduced expression of transcripts coding for ammonia oxidation proteins, and increased expression of a gene coding an Hsp20-like chaperone.

Engineering antibodies in mammalian cells offers advantages associated with expression in their final therapeutic format (full-length glycosylated IgG), however, the inability to express large and diverse libraries severely limits their potential throughput. To address this limitation, we have developed homology-directed mutagenesis (HDM), a novel method which extends the concept of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). HDM leverages oligonucleotides with degenerate codons to generate site-directed mutagenesis libraries in mammalian cells. By improving HDM efficiency (>35-fold) and combining mammalian display screening with next-generation sequencing (NGS), we validated this approach can be used for key applications in antibody engineering at high-throughput: rational library construction, novel variant discovery, affinity maturation, and deep mutational scanning (DMS). We anticipate that HDM will be a valuable tool for engineering and optimizing antibodies in mammalian cells, and eventually enable directed evolution of other complex proteins and cellular therapeutics.","10.1093/nar/gky550"

Reference genome structures incorporating known genetic variation have been shown to improve the accuracy of genomic analyses, but have so far remained computationally prohibitive for routine large-scale use. Here we present a graph genome implementation that enables read alignment across 2,800 diploid genomes encompassing 12.6 million SNPs and 4.0 million indels. Our Graph Genome Pipeline requires 6.5 hours to process a 30x coverage WGS sample on a system with 36 CPU cores compared with 11 hours required by the GATK Best Practices pipeline. Using complementary benchmarking experiments based on real and simulated data, we show that using a graph genome reference improves read mapping sensitivity and produces a 0.5% increase in variant calling recall, or about 20,000 additional variants being detected per sample, while variant calling specificity is unaffected. Structural variations (SVs) incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework. Finally, we show that iterative augmentation of graph genomes yields incremental gains in variant calling accuracy. Our implementation is a significant advance towards fulfilling the promise of graph genomes to radically enhance the scalability and accuracy of genomic analyses.","10.1038/s41588-018-0316-4"

The mechanisms of persistent AF are still subject to debate. Both a single mother-rotor with fibrillatory conduction and multiple meandering spiral waves have been proposed to explain persistent AF. Previous frequency domain studies have reported the presence of dominant frequency (DF) gradient (a marker of single mother-rotor) in paroxysmal, but not persistent AF.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe performed temporally-dense high-resolution frequency domain analysis of 10-40 minutes segments of intracardiac signals recorded in 24 patients undergoing ablation of persistent AF. We observed two predominant patterns. The expected signature of the mother-rotor mechanism was observed in 38% of the patients. The frequency pattern in 54% consisted of two or more distinct frequency peaks with no obvious gradient, which is consistent with multiple separate primary spiral waves in electrophysiologically heterogeneous areas of atria. The average measured number of rotors per case was 1.71 {+/-} 0.32, which provides a lower limit on the actual number of rotors. The single-zone pattern was exclusively seen in patients who were on a membrane-active antiarrhythmic medication at the time of ablation (P < 0.005).\n\nConclusionsAF is a heterogeneous disorder. High-frequency resolution analysis is a useful tool to detect the underlying mechanisms of AF and to classify it into patterns consistent with a single mother-rotor vs. multiple meandering wavelets.","NA"

During the process of investigating dietary effects on gene regulation in L1 stage worms by single-worm RNA-Seq, we found that the density of resuspended L1 larvae affects expression of many mRNAs. Specifically, a number of genes related to metabolism and signalling are highly expressed in worms arrested at low density, but are repressed at higher arrest densities. We generated a GFP reporter strain based on one of the most density-dependent genes in our dataset - lips-15 - and confirmed that this reporter was expressed specifically in worms arrested at relatively low density. Finally, we show that conditioned media from high density L1 cultures was able to downregulate lips-15 even in L1 animals arrested at low density, and experiments using daf-22 mutant animals demonstrated that this effect is not mediated by the ascaroside family of signalling pheromones. Together, our data implicate a soluble signalling molecule in density sensing by L1 stage C. elegans, and provide guidance for design of experiments focused on early developmental gene regulation.","10.1534/g3.118.200056"

However, the presence of multiple distinct subgenomes within a single lineage provides a significant logistical challenge to evaluating the origin of genetic variation in most polyploids. Here, we capitalize on three recent innovations--variation generated from ultraconserved elements (UCEs), bioinformatic techniques for assessing variation in polyploids, and model-based methods for evaluating historical gene flow--to measure the extent and tempo of introgression over the evolutionary history of an allopolyploid lineage of all-female salamanders and two ancestral sexual species. We first analyzed variation from more than a thousand UCEs using a reference mapping method developed for polyploids to infer subgenome specific patterns of variation in the all-female lineage. We then used PHRAPL to choose between sets of historical models that reflected different patterns of introgression and divergence between the genomes of the parental species and the same genomes found within the polyploids. Our analyses support a scenario in which the genomes sampled in unisexuals salamanders were present in the lineage [~]3.4 million years ago, followed by an extended period of divergence from their parental species. Recent secondary introgression has occurred at different times between each sexual species and their representative genomes within the unisexuals during the last 500,000 years. Sustained introgression of sexual genomes into the unisexual lineage has been the defining characteristic of their reproductive mode, but this study provides the first evidence that unisexual genomes have also undergone long periods of divergence without introgression. Unlike other unisexual, sperm-dependent taxa in which introgression is rare, the alternating periods of divergence and introgression between unisexual salamanders and their sexual relatives could reveal the scenarios in which the influx of novel genomic material is favored and potentially explain why these salamanders are among the oldest described unisexual animals.","10.1111/evo.13528"

SOUP involves a two-step process: identify the set of pure cells and then estimate a membership matrix. To find pure cells, SOUP uses the special block structure the K cell types form in a similarity matrix, devised by pairwise comparison of the gene expression profiles of individual cells. Once pure cells are identified, they provide the key information from which the membership matrix can be computed. SOUP is applicable to general clustering problems as well, as long as the unrestrictive modeling assumptions hold. The performance of SOUP is documented via extensive simulation studies.

In this study, we develop a triplex paralogue ratio test (PRT) assay for CR1 LCR copy number allowing large numbers of samples to be typed with a limited amount of DNA. We also develop a CR1-B allele-specific PCR based on the junction generated by an historical non-allelic homologous recombination event between CR1 LCRs.

Research has linked the experience of hallucinations in schizophrenia to differences in the length of the paracingulate sulcus (PCS), a structure in the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain which has previously been associated with the ability to differentiate perceived and imagined information. We investigated whether this notion of a specific morphological basis for hallucinations in the paracingulate cortex extends to individuals without a clinical diagnosis by testing the hypothesis that non-clinical individuals with hallucinations have shorter PCS than non-clinical individuals without hallucinations. Structural MRI scans were examined from three demographically matched groups of individuals: 50 patients with psychotic diagnoses who experienced auditory verbal hallucinations, 50 non-clinical individuals with auditory verbal hallucinations, and 50 healthy control subjects with no life-time history of hallucinations. Measurements of paracingulate sulcal length were compared between the groups and the results verified using automated data-driven gyrification analyses. Patients with hallucinations had shorter PCS than both healthy controls and non-clinical individuals with hallucinations, with no difference between non-clinical individuals with hallucinations and healthy controls. These findings suggest that the association of shorter PCS length with hallucinations is specific to patients with a psychotic disorder. This presents challenges for continuum models of psychosis and suggests possible differences in the mechanisms underlying hallucinations in clinical and non-clinical groups.","NA"

When these stimuli predict future odors, they evoke enhanced interneuron activity during the time odor normally occurs. When expectations are violated by omitting an expected \""warning tone\"" before an odor, odor presentation evokes a burst of interneuron activity.

This strategy enabled robust and reliable estimation of key repertoire features such as clonotype diversity, germline segment and isotype subclass usage, and somatic hypermutation (SHM).

In support of the hypothesis that chain formation promotes competence, we demonstrate that an autolysin mutant (lytB) is hypercompetent. As competence is initiated by the binding of a small extracellular peptide (CSP) to a membrane-anchored receptor (ComD), we wondered if chain formation alters CSP diffusion and thereby sensing by ComD. Indeed, the presence of AZT or CLA affects competence synchronization by switching CSP-based quorum sensing to autocrine-like signaling, as CSP is retained to chained cells and no longer shared in a common pool.

A conceptual replication was also made using continuous exposure for 16 days in waterborne ethanol (0.5%) and assessing anxiety-like behavior in the light/dark test after 60 min withdrawal. Withdrawal was shown to reduce preference for darkness, consistent with decreased anxiety, but to increase risk assessment, consistent with increased anxiety. Animals were also subjected to the withdrawal protocol and injected with pilocarpine in a sub-convulsive dose to assess susceptibility to epileptic seizure-like behavior. The protocol was sufficient to increase susceptibility to epileptic seizure-like behavior in animals exposed to ethanol.

However, because linkage equilibrium implicates a broad region surrounding each identified locus, the causal genes often remain unknown. This problem is especially pronounced in non-human, non-model species where functional annotations are sparse and there is frequently little information available for prioritizing candidate genes.\n\nResultsTo address this issue, we developed a computational approach called Camoco (Co-Analysis of Molecular Components) that systematically integrates loci identified by GWAS with gene co-expression networks to prioritize putative causal genes. We applied Camoco to prioritize candidate genes from a large-scale GWAS examining the accumulation of 17 different elements in maize seeds. Camoco identified statistically significant subnetworks for the majority of traits examined, producing a prioritized list of high-confidence causal genes for several agronomically important maize traits. Two candidate genes identified by our approach were validated through analysis of mutant phenotypes. Strikingly, we observed a strong dependence in the performance of our approach on the type of co-expression network used: expression variation across genetically diverse individuals in a relevant tissue context (in our case, maize roots) outperformed other alternatives.\n\nConclusionsOur study demonstrates that co-expression networks can provide a powerful basis for prioritizing candidate causal genes from GWAS loci, but suggests that the success of such strategies can highly depend on the gene expression data context.

A dynamics simulation by modeling M. magneticum AMB-1 cell as an ellipsoid showed that the difference of the motions between wild and{Delta} amb0994 is due to flagellar influence. The behavior observation being consistent with dynamics simulation indicated that Amb0994 is involved in the cellular response to magnetic torque change via controlling flagella. Besides the contribution to a better understanding of the magnetotaxis mechanism, this study demonstrates the CRISPR system as a useful genetic toolbox for high-efficiency genome editing in magnetotactic bacteria.","10.3389/fmicb.2018.01569"

These immune receptors often function to directly or indirectly mediate the perception of specific pathogen effector proteins secreted into the cell. Activation of these immune receptors typically results in activation of the immune system and subsequent suppression of pathogen proliferation. Although many examples of NLR receptors are known, a mechanistic understanding of how receptor activation ultimately leads to an immune response is not well understood. A subset of the NLR proteins contain a TIR domain at their N terminus (TNL). One such TNL, the N gene, was previously shown to depend on a non-TIR NLR protein, N requirement gene 1 (NRG1) for immune function. We tested additional NLR proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana for dependency on NRG1. We found that two additional TIR-NLR proteins, Roq1 and RPP1, also require NRG1 but that two coiled-coil NLR proteins, Bs2 and Rps2, do not. This finding suggests that NRG1 may be a conserved component of TNL signaling pathways.","NA"

Given that peripheral and central arbor formation of Mrgprd+ neurons co-occurs around the time of birth, we tested whether peripheral cues from different skin areas and/or postnatal reorganization mechanisms could instruct this somatotopic difference among central arbors. We found that, while terminal outgrowth/refinement occurs during early postnatal development in both the skin and the DH, postnatal refinement of central terminals precedes that of peripheral terminals. Further, we used single-cell ablation of Ret to genetically disrupt epidermal innervation of Mrgprd+ neurons and revealed that the somatotopic difference among their central arbors was unaffected by this manipulation. Finally, we saw that region-specific Mrgprd+ central terminal arbors are present from the earliest postnatal stages, before skin terminals are evident. Together, our data indicate that region-specific organization of Mrgprd+ neuron central arbors develops independently of peripheral target innervation and is present shortly after initial central terminal formation, suggesting that either cell-intrinsic and/or DH local signaling may establish this somatotopic difference.","NA"

For an asymmetric-reward perceptual decision-making task, three monkeys produced adaptive biases in response to changes in reward asymmetries and perceptual sensitivity. Their choices and response times were consistent with a normative accumulate-to-bound process. However, their context-dependent adjustments to this process deviated slightly but systematically from the reward-maximizing solutions. These adjustments were instead consistent with a rational process to find satisficing solutions based on the gradient of each monkeys reward-rate function.

The need to consider many variants at a locus or group of genes simultaneously and the potential to study many correlated phenotypes with shared genetic architecture provide opportunities for discovery and inference that are not addressed by the traditional one variant-one phenotype association study. Here we introduce a model comparison approach we refer to as MRP for rare variant association studies that considers correlation, scale, and location of genetic effects across a group of genetic variants, phenotypes, and studies. We consider the use of summary statistic data to apply univariate and multivariate gene-based meta-analysis models for identifying rare variant associations with an emphasis on protective protein-truncating variants that can expedite drug discovery. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed model comparison approach can improve ability to detect rare variant association signals. We also apply the model to two groups of phenotypes from the UK Biobank: 1) asthma diagnosis, eosinophil counts, forced expiratory volume, and forced vital capacity; and 2) glaucoma diagnosis, intra-ocular pressure, and corneal resistance factor. We are able to recover known associations such as the protective association between rs146597587 in IL33 and asthma. We also find evidence for novel protective associations between rare variants in ANGPTL7 and glaucoma. Overall, we show that the MRP model comparison approach is able to retain and improve upon useful features from widely-used meta-analysis approaches for rare variant association analyses and prioritize protective modifiers of disease risk.\n\nAuthor summaryDue to the continually decreasing cost of acquiring genetic data, we are now beginning to see large collections of individuals for which we have both genetic information and trait data such as disease status, physical measurements, biomarker levels, and more. These datasets offer new opportunities to find relationships between inherited genetic variation and disease. While it is known that there are relationships between different traits, typical genetic analyses only focus on analyzing one genetic variant and one phenotype at a time. Additionally, it is difficult to identify rare genetic variants that are associated with disease due to their scarcity, even among large sample sizes. In this work, we present a method for identifying associations between genetic variation and disease that considers multiple rare variants and phenotypes at the same time. By sharing information across rare variant and phenotypes, we improve our ability to identify rare variants associated with disease compared to considering a single rare variant and a single phenotype. The method can be used to identify candidate disease genes as well as genes that might represent attractive drug targets.","NA"

This assumption, however, is rarely tested, likely because observing disease transmission between host individuals is non-trivial in many infectious diseases. Quantifying the transmission of insect baculoviruses at a small scale is in contrast straightforward. We fit a disease model to data from baculovirus epizootics (= epidemics in animals) at the scale of whole forests, while using prior parameter distributions constructed from branch-scale experiments. Our experimentally-constrained model fits the large-scale data very well, supporting the role of small-scale transmission mechanisms in baculovirus epizootics. We further compared our experimentally-based model to an unconstrained model that ignores our experimental data, serving as a proxy for models that include large-scale mechanisms. This analysis supports our hypothesis that small-scale mechanisms are important, especially individual variability in host susceptibility to the virus. Comparison of transmission rates in the two models, however, suggests that large-scale mechanisms increase transmission compared to our experimental estimates. Our study shows that small-scale and large-scale mechanisms drive forest-wide epizootics of baculoviruses, and that synthesizing mathematical models with data collected across scales is key to understanding the spread of infectious disease.","10.1086/707457"

Despite this high prevalence, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of Chlamydia pathogenesis has been difficult due to limitations in genetic tools and its intracellular developmental cycle. Within a host epithelial cell, chlamydiae replicate within a vacuole called the inclusion. Many Chlamydia-host interactions are thought to be mediated by the Inc family of type III secreted proteins that are anchored in the inclusion membrane, but their array of host targets are largely unknown. To investigate how the inclusion membrane proteome changes over the course of an infected cell, we have adapted the APEX system of proximity-dependent biotinylation. APEX is capable of specifically labeling proteins within a 20 nm radius in living cells. We transformed C. trachomatis to express the enzyme APEX fused to known inclusion membrane proteins, allowing biotinylation and pull-down of inclusion-associated proteins. Using quantitative mass spectrometry against APEX labeled samples, we identified over 400 proteins associated with the inclusion membrane at early, middle, and late stages of epithelial cell infection. This system was sensitive enough to detect inclusion interacting proteins early in the developmental cycle, at 8 hours post infection, a previously intractable time point. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed a novel, early association between C. trachomatis inclusions and endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES), functional regions of the ER where COPII-coated vesicles originate. Pharmacological and genetic disruption of ERES function severely restricted early chlamydial growth and the development of infectious progeny. APEX is therefore a powerful in situ approach for identifying critical protein interactions on the membranes of pathogen-containing vacuoles. Furthermore, the data derived from proteomic mapping of Chlamydia inclusions has illuminated an important functional role for ERES in promoting chlamydial developmental growth.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007698"

Model parameters are paternal and maternal transmission rates, cost of infection, and up to two migration rates. We investigated three different population structures: (1) a single panmictic host population, (2) two populations connected by unidirectional migration (mainland-island model), and (3) two populations connected by two-way migration. According to the results, the parameter space can be divided in three zones: (1) viral spread, (2) no viral spread, (3) bistability (in a single population) or stable infection polymorphism (in the two-population models). The finding of bistability is interesting and new. It shows that infected and uninfected populations can stably coexist, if migration is below a critical value, and if the cost of infection is moderately high. In summary, our results show that spatial structure of host populations is an important factor in determining geographical differences of vertically transmitted viruses.","NA"

Mechanical and enzymatic dissociation parameters were optimized for viable cell extraction and surface protein preservation for cell sorting and mass cytometry, as well as for reproducibility in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Cryopreserved synovial samples were collectively analyzed at a central processing site by a custom-designed and validated 35-marker mass cytometry panel. In parallel, each sample was flow sorted into fibroblast, T cell, B cell, and macrophage suspensions for bulk population RNA-seq and plate-based single cell CEL-Seq2 RNA-seq.\n\nResultsUpon dissociation, cryopreserved synovial tissue fragments yielded a high frequency of viable cells, comparable to samples undergoing immediate processing. Optimization of synovial tissue dissociation across six clinical collection sites with [~]30 arthroplasty and [~]20 biopsy samples yielded a consensus digestion protocol using 100{micro}g/mL of Liberase TL enzyme. This protocol yielded immune and stromal cell lineages with preserved surface markers and minimized variability across replicate RNA-seq transcriptomes. Mass cytometry analysis of cells from cryopreserved synovium distinguished: 1) diverse fibroblast phenotypes, 2) distinct populations of memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells, and 3) multiple CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation states. Bulk RNA sequencing of sorted cell populations demonstrated robust separation of synovial lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Single cell RNA-seq produced transcriptomes of over 1000 genes/cell, including transcripts encoding characteristic lineage markers identified.\n\nConclusionWe have established a robust protocol to acquire viable cells from cryopreserved synovial tissue with intact transcriptomes and cell surface phenotypes. A centralized pipeline to generate multiple high-dimensional analyses of synovial tissue samples collected across a collaborative network was developed. Integrated analysis of such datasets from large patient cohorts may help define molecular heterogeneity within RA pathology and identify new therapeutic targets and biomarkers.","10.1186/s13075-018-1631-y"

Genetic studies have established that CRP and Sxy co-activate transcription at gene promoters containing DNA binding sites called CRP-S sites. In contrast, CRP acts without Sxy at gene promoters containing canonical CRP-N sites, suggesting that Sxy makes physical contacts with CRP and/or DNA to assist in transcriptional activation at CRP-S promoters. Despite growing interest in Sxys activity as a transcription factor, Sxy remains poorly characterized due to a lack of reliable phenotypes in E. coli. Experiments are further hampered by growth inhibition and formation of inclusion bodies when Sxy is overexpressed. In this study we applied diverse phenotypic and molecular assays to test for postulated Sxy functions and interactions. Mutations in conserved regions of Sxy and truncations in the Sxy C-terminus abolish transcriptional activation of a CRP-S promoter, and a 37 amino acid truncation of the C-terminus relieves the growth inhibition normally caused by Sxy overexpression. Sxy was unable to augment weakened CRP interactions to restore carbon metabolism phenotypes. Bandshift analysis and chromatin pull-down assays of Sxy-CRP-DNA interactions yielded intriguing evidence of CRP-Sxy and Sxy-DNA physical interactions. However, despite the careful application of standard protein purification protocols and quality control steps for nickel affinity column purification, protein mass spectrometry revealed the enrichment of additional DNA-binding proteins in nickel column eluates, presenting a probable source of artefactual protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction results. These findings highlight the importance of extensive controls and phenotypic assays for the study of poorly characterized and recalcitrant proteins like Sxy.","NA"

We analyzed OIP5-AS1 expression in oral tumors and in TCGA datasets. We observed overexpression of OIP5-AS1 in oral tumors (P<0.001) and in tumors of epithelial origin from TCGA. OIP5-AS1 expression was strongly associated with undifferentiated tumors (P=0.0038). In silico analysis showed miR-7 binding site is conserved in mouse and human OIP5-AS1. However, human NANOG 3-UTR lost the binding site for hsa-miR-7a-3. Therefore, we screened for other miRNAs that can be sponged by OIP5-AS1 and identified six potential miRNAs and their downstream target genes. Expression analysis showed downregulation of miRNAs and upregulation of downstream target genes, particularly in undifferentiated tumors with high-level of OIP5-AS1 suggesting that OIP5-AS1 could post-transcriptionally modulate the downstream target genes. Further, systematic epigenomic analysis of OIP5-AS1 promoter revealed binding motifs for MYC, NANOG and KLF4 suggesting that OIP5-AS1 could be transactivated by stemness-associated transcription factors in cancer.

This study characterises a collection of isolates associated with IMD and carriage in Shanghai and assesses current vaccine strategies.\n\nMethodsIMD epidemiological data in Shanghai from 1950-2016 were obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Registry System, with 460 isolates collected for analysis including, 169 from IMD and 291 from carriage. Serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccine coverage was evaluated using Bexsero(R) Antigen Sequence Type (BAST).\n\nResultsSeven IMD epidemic periods have been observed in Shanghai since 1950, with incidence peaking from February to April. Analyses were divided according to the period of meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPV) introduction: (i) pre-MPV-A, 1965-1980; (ii) post-MPV-A, 1981-2008; and (iii) post-MPV-A+C, 2009-2016. IMD incidence decreased from 55.4/100,000 to 0.71 then to 0.02, and corresponded with shifts from serogroup A ST-5 complex (MenA:cc5) to MenC:cc4821 then MenB:cc4821. MenB IMD became predominant (63.2%) in the post-MPV-A+C period, of which 50% were caused by cc4821, with the highest incidence in infants (0.45/100,000) and a case-fatality rate of 9.5%. IMD was positively correlated with carriage rates. Data indicate that fewer than 25% of MenB isolates in the post-MPV-A+C period may be covered by the vaccines Bexsero(R), Trumenba(R), or a PorA-based vaccine, NonaMen.\n\nConclusionsA unique IMD epidemiology is found in China, changing periodically from hyperepidemic to low-level endemic disease.

We consider different disease progressions accounting for lethal infection, immunity waning, and potential cross-species transmission when the two populations share the same refuge along the migratory path of M. schreibersii.\n\nResultsWe find that EBLV-1 persistence relies on host spatial structure through the migratory nature of M. schreibersii bats, on cross-species mixing with M. myotis population, and on a disease progression leading to survival of infected animals followed by temporary immunity. The higher fragmentation along the northern portion of the migratory path is necessary to maintain EBLV-1 sustained circulation in both species, whereas persistence would not be ensured in the single colony of M. myotis. Our study provides first estimates for the EBLV-1 transmission potential in M. schreibersii bats and average duration of immunity in the host species, yielding values compatible with previous empirical observations in M. myotis bats.\n\nConclusionsHabitats sharing and the strong spatial component of EBLV-1 transmission dynamics identified as key drivers in this ecological context may help understanding the observed spatial diffusion of the virus at a larger scale and across a diverse range of host species, through long-range migration and seeding of local populations.

The patients diagnostic leukemia transcriptome was depleted of rare and low-frequency germline alleles due to loss-of-heterozygosity, while somatic point mutations targeted low-frequency and common human alleles in proportions that offset this discrepancy.

Although many examples of NLR receptors are known, a mechanistic understanding of how receptor activation ultimately leads to an immune response is not well understood. A subset of the NLR proteins contain a TIR domain at their N terminus (TNL). One such TNL, the N gene, was previously shown to depend on a non-TIR NLR protein, N requirement gene 1 (NRG1) for immune function.

However, analyzing sequence read counts from a DNA pool instead of individual genotypes raises statistical challenges in deriving correct estimates of genetic differentiation. In this article, we provide a method-of-moments estimator of FST for Pool-seq data, based on an analysis-of-variance framework.

D.","Daniel Schrider","Rutgers University","2018-03-20",3,"1","new results","evolutionary biology","Hybridization and gene flow between species appears to be common. Even though it is clear that hybridization is widespread across all surveyed taxonomic groups, the magnitude and consequences of introgression are still largely unknown. Thus it is crucial to develop the statistical machinery required to uncover which genomic regions have recently acquired haplotypes via introgression from a sister population. We developed a novel machine learning framework, called FILET (Finding Introgressed Loci via Extra-Trees) capable of revealing genomic introgression with far greater power than competing methods. FILET works by combining information from a number of population genetic summary statistics, including several new statistics that we introduce, that capture patterns of variation across two populations. We show that FILET is able to identify loci that have experienced gene flow between related species with high accuracy, and in most situations can correctly infer which population was the donor and which was the recipient. Here we describe a data set of outbred diploid Drosophila sechellia genomes, and combine them with data from D. simulans to examine recent introgression between these species using FILET. Although we find that these populations may have split more recently than previously appreciated, FILET confirms that there has indeed been appreciable recent introgression (some of which might have been adaptive) between these species, and reveals that this gene flow is primarily in the direction of D. simulans to D. sechellia.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYUnderstanding the extent to which species or diverged populations hybridize in nature is crucially important if we are to understand the speciation process. Accordingly numerous research groups have developed methodology for finding the genetic evidence of such introgression. In this report we develop a supervised machine learning approach for uncovering loci which have introgressed across species boundaries. We show that our method, FILET, has greater accuracy and power than competing methods in discovering introgression, and in addition can detect the directionality associated with the gene flow between species. Using whole genome sequences from Drosophila simulans and Drosophila sechellia we show that FILET discovers quite extensive introgression between these species that has occurred mostly from D. simulans to D. sechellia. Our work highlights the complex process of speciation even within a well-studied system and points to the growing importance of supervised machine learning in population genetics.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007341"

Frameshift mutations have been considered as mostly harmful and of little importance for the molecular evolution of proteins. Frameshift protein sequences, encoded by the alternative reading frames of a coding gene, have been therefore considered as meaningless. However, existing studies had shown that frameshift genes/proteins are widely existing and sometimes functional. It is puzzling how a frameshift kept its structure and functionality while its amino-acid sequence is changed substantially. Here we demonstrate that the protein sequences of the frameshifts are highly conservative when compared with the wild-type protein sequence, and the similarities among the three protein sequences encoded in the three reading frames of a coding gene are defined mainly by the genetic code. In the standard genetic code, amino acid substitutions assigned to frameshift codon substitutions are far more conservative than those assigned to random substitutions. The frameshift tolerability of the standard genetic code ranks in the top 1.0-5.0% of all possible genetic codes, showing that the genetic code is optimal in terms of frameshift tolerance. In some higher species, the shiftability is further optimized at gene- or genome-level by a biased usage of codons and codon pairs, in which frameshift-tolerable codons/codon pairs are overrepresented in their genomes.","NA"

Here, we have established an approach for performing highly accurate human Ig-seq by combining synthetic standards with a comprehensive error and bias correction pipeline. First, we designed a set of 85 synthetic antibody heavy chain standards (in vitro transcribed RNA) to assess correction workflow fidelity. Next, we adapted a library preparation protocol that incorporates unique molecular identifiers (UIDs) for error and bias correction which, when applied to the synthetic standards, resulted in highly accurate data. Finally, we performed Ig-seq on purified human circulating B cell subsets (naive and memory), combined with a cellular replicate sampling strategy. This strategy enabled robust and reliable estimation of key repertoire features such as clonotype diversity, germline segment and isotype subclass usage, and somatic hypermutation (SHM). We anticipate that our standards and error and bias correction pipeline will become a valuable tool for researchers to validate and improve accuracy in human Ig-seq studies, thus leading to potentially new insights and applications in human antibody repertoire profiling.","10.3389/fimmu.2018.01401"

Motivated by this, we present a new method for pairwise relatedness inference, which requires neither allele frequency information nor information on genomic position. Furthermore, it can be applied to both genotype data and to low-depth sequencing data where genotypes cannot be accurately called. We evaluate it using data from SNP arrays and low-depth sequencing from a range of human populations and show that it can be used to infer close familial relationships with a similar accuracy as a widely used method that relies on population allele frequencies.

Dozens of proteins regulate exocytosis, yet the temporal and spatial dynamics of these factors during vesicle fusion remain unclear. Here we use total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to visualize local protein dynamics at single sites of exocytosis of small synaptic-like microvesicles in live cultured neuroendocrine PC12 cells. We employ two-color imaging to simultaneously observe membrane fusion (using vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) tagged to pHluorin) and the dynamics of associated proteins at the moments surrounding exocytosis. Our experiments show that many proteins, including the SNAREs syntaxin1 and VAMP2, the SNARE modulator tomosyn, and Rab proteins, are pre-clustered at fusion sites and rapidly lost at fusion. The ATPase NSF is locally recruited at fusion. Interestingly, the endocytic BAR domain-containing proteins amphiphysin1, syndapin2, and endophilins are dynamically recruited to fusion sites, and slow the loss of vesicle membrane-bound cargo from fusion sites. A similar effect on vesicle membrane protein dynamics was seen with the over-expression of the GTPases dynamin1 and dynamin2. These results suggest that proteins involved in classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis can regulate exocytosis of synaptic-like microvesicles. Our findings provide insights into the dynamics, assembly, and mechanistic roles of many key factors of exocytosis and endocytosis at single sites of microvesicle fusion in live cells.","10.1091/mbc.E17-12-0716"

Phage extinction was frequently observed when the proportion of phage-resistant sub-populations exceeded 34%. In silico modelling indicated that phage extinction was interdependent on phage loss during transfer between populations and the frequency of resistant populations. In a fixed-area oscillating prey assay, heterogeneity in phage resistance was observed to generate vast differences in phage densities across multiple bacterial populations resulting in protective quarantining of some populations from phage attack. We conclude that phase-variable hypermutable loci produce bacterial  herd immunity with resistant intermediary-populations acting as a barricade to reduce the viral load faced by phage-sensitive sub-populations. This paradigm of meta-population protection is applicable to evolution of hypermutable loci in multiple bacteria-phage and host-pathogen interactions.\n\nImportanceHerd immunity is a survival strategy wherein populations are protected against invading pathogens by resistant individuals within the population acting as a barrier to spread of the infectious agent. Although, this concept is normally only applied to higher eukaryotes, prokaryotic organisms also face invasion by infectious agents, such as bacterial viruses, bacteriophage (phage). Here we use novel experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, to show that bacteria exhibit a form of herd immunity through stochastically generated resistant variants acting as barricades to phage predation of sensitive cells. With hypermutable loci found in many prokaryotic systems, this phenomenon may be widely applicable to phage-bacteria interactions and could even impact phage-driven evolution in bacteria.","NA"

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are attractive approaches to complement vaccination in the prevention and reduction of influenza. Strong cyclical reduction of absolute humidity has been associated with influenza outbreaks in temperate climates. This study tested the hypothesis that raising absolute humidity above seasonal lows would impact influenza virus survival and transmission in a key source of influenza distribution, a community school. Air samples and objects handled by students (e.g. blocks and markers) were collected from preschool classrooms. All samples were processed and PCR used to determine the presence of influenza and its amount. Additionally samples were tested for their ability to infect cells in cultures. Deliberate classroom humidification (with commercial steam humidifiers) resulted in a significant reduction of the total number of influenza positive samples (air and fomite), viral copy number, and efficiency of viral infectivity. This is the first prospective study suggesting that exogenous humidification could serve as a scalable NPI for influenza or other viral outbreaks.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman influenza infections have a substantial impact on society (including lost productivity and medical costs). Children, 3-4 years of age are the main introducers and spreaders of influenza within a household and community. There is evidence from laboratory and epidemiological studies that suggests that low humidity in winter (in temperate climates) may increase the ability of influenza virus to survive and spread between individuals. We wanted to know if added in humidity (through steam humidifiers) could reduce the amount of influenza present and its spread within preschool classrooms (students aged 3-4 years)? Additionally, we looked at the infectivity of the influenza isolated and if there were differences in the number of students with influenza-like illnesses during our study. We show that humidification can reduce the amount of influenza present within samples from preschool classrooms and that there were fewer infectious samples compared to non-humidified rooms. There were small numbers of students ill with influenza like illnesses during our study so additional studies will need to look further at humidification as a way to reduce influenza infection and transmission.","10.1371/journal.pone.0204337"

Although this approach is prevalent and promising, our review identified four challenges. First, the composition of networks varied remarkably in terms of region parcellation and edge definition, which are fundamental to graph analyses. Second, many studies equated the number of connections across graphs, but this is conceptually problematic in clinical populations and may induce spurious group differences. Third, few graph metrics were reported in common, precluding meta-analyses. Fourth, some studies tested hypotheses at one level of the graph without a clear neurobiological rationale or considering how findings at one level (e.g., global topology) are contextualized by another (e.g., modular structure). Based on these themes, we conducted network simulations to demonstrate the impact of specific methodological decisions on case-control comparisons.

It has been difficult to quantify the mechanism by which structural changes disrupt the superimposed brain dynamics, leading to the emotional lability that is characteristic of BD. Average controllability is a concept from network control theory that extends structural connectivity data to estimate the manner in which local neuronal fluctuations spread from a node or subnetwork to alter the state of the rest of the brain. We used this theory to ask whether structural connectivity deficits previously observed in HR (n=84, mean age 22.4) individuals, patients with BD (n=38, mean age 23.9), and age- and gender-matched controls (n=96, mean age 22.6) translate to differences in the ability of brain systems to be manipulated between states. Localized impairments in network controllability were seen in the left parahippocampal, left middle occipital, left superior frontal, right inferior frontal, and right precentral gyri in BD and HR groups. Subjects with BD had distributed deficits in a subnetwork containing the left superior and inferior frontal gyri, postcentral gyrus, and insula (p=0.004). HR participants had controllability deficits in a right-lateralized subnetwork involving connections between the dorsomedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the superior temporal pole, putamen, and caudate nucleus (p=0.008). Between-group controllability differences were attenuated after removal of topological factors by network randomization. Some previously reported differences in network connectivity were not associated with controllability-differences, likely reflecting the contribution of more complex brain network properties. These analyses highlight the potential functional consequences of altered brain networks in BD, and may guide future clinical interventions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIControl theory estimates how neuronal fluctuations spread from local networks.\nC_LIO_LIWe compare brain controllability in bipolar disorder and their high-risk relatives.\nC_LIO_LIThese groups have impaired controllability in networks supporting cognitive and emotional control.\nC_LIO_LIWeaker connectivity as well as topological alterations contribute to these changes.\nC_LI","10.1016/j.nicl.2018.03.032"

Here we present a graph genome implementation that enables read alignment across 2,800 diploid genomes encompassing 12.6 million SNPs and 4.0 million indels.

Structural variations (SVs) incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework. Finally, we show that iterative augmentation of graph genomes yields incremental gains in variant calling accuracy.

McGregor","Oxford Brookes University","2018-03-20",2,"4","new results","evolutionary biology","Convergent phenotypic evolution is often caused by recurrent changes at particular nodes in the underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The genes at such evolutionary  hotspots are thought to maximally affect the phenotype with minimal pleiotropic consequences. This has led to the suggestion that if a GRN is understood in sufficient detail, the path of evolution may be predictable. The repeated evolutionary loss of larval trichomes among Drosophila species is caused by the loss of shavenbaby (svb) expression. svb is also required for development of leg trichomes, but the evolutionary gain of trichomes in the  naked valley on T2 femurs in Drosophila melanogaster is caused by the loss of microRNA-92a (miR-92a) expression rather than changes in svb. We compared the expression and function of components between the larval and leg trichome GRNs to investigate why the genetic basis of trichome pattern evolution differs in these developmental contexts. We found key differences between the two networks in both the genes employed, and in the regulation and function of common genes. These differences in the GRNs reveal why mutations in svb are unlikely to contribute to leg trichome evolution and how instead miR-92a represents the key evolutionary switch in this context. Our work shows that variability in GRNs across different developmental contexts, as well as whether a morphological feature is lost versus gained, influence the nodes at which a GRN evolves to cause morphological change. Therefore, our findings have important implications for understanding the pathways and predictability of evolution.\n\nAuthor SummaryA major goal of biology is to identify the genetic cause of organismal diversity. Convergent evolution of traits is often caused by changes in the same genes - evolutionary  hotspots. shavenbaby is a  hotspot for larval trichome loss in Drosophila, however microRNA-92a underlies the gain of leg trichomes. To understand this difference in the genetics of phenotypic evolution, we compared the expression and function of genes in the underlying regulatory networks. We found that the pathway of evolution is influenced by differences in gene regulatory network architecture in different developmental contexts, as well as by whether a trait is lost or gained. Therefore, hotspots in one context may not readily evolve in a different context. This has important implications for understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic change and the predictability of evolution.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007375"

J.","Fergal M Waldron","Institute of Evolutionary Biology","2018-03-20",2,"1","new results","evolutionary biology","RNA interference (RNAi)-related pathways target viruses and transposable element (TE) transcripts in plants, fungi, and ecdysozoans (nematodes and arthropods), giving protection against infection and transmission. In each case, this produces abundant TE and virus-derived 20-30nt small RNAs, which provide a characteristic signature of RNAi-mediated defence. The broad phylogenetic distribution of the Argonaute and Dicer-family genes that mediate these pathways suggests that defensive RNAi is ancient and probably shared by most animal (metazoan) phyla. Indeed, while vertebrates had been thought an exception, it has recently been argued that mammals also possess an antiviral RNAi pathway, although its immunological relevance is currently uncertain and the viral small RNAs are not detectably under natural conditions. Here we use a metagenomic approach to test for the presence of virus-derived small RNAs in five divergent animal phyla (Porifera, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, Mollusca, and Annelida), and in a brown alga--which represents an independent origin of multicellularity from plants, fungi, and animals. We use metagenomic RNA sequencing to identify around 80 virus-like contigs in these lineages, and small RNA sequencing to identify small RNAs derived from those viruses. Contrary to our expectations, we were unable to identify canonical (i.e. Drosophila-, nematode- or plant-like) viral small RNAs in any of these organisms, despite the widespread presence of abundant micro-RNAs, and transposon-derived somatic Piwi-interacting piRNAs in the animals. Instead, we identified a distinctive group of virus-derived small RNAs in the mollusc, which have a piRNA-like length distribution but lack key signatures of piRNA biogenesis, and a group of 21U virus-derived small RNAs in the brown alga. We also identified primary piRNAs derived from putatively endogenous copies of DNA viruses in the cnidarian and the echinoderm, and an endogenous RNA virus in the mollusc. The absence of canonical virus-derived small RNAs from our samples may suggest that the majority of animal phyla lack an antiviral RNAi response. Alternatively, these phyla could possess an antiviral RNAi response resembling that reported for vertebrates, which is not detectable through simple metagenomic sequencing of wild-type individuals. In either case, our findings suggest that the current antiviral RNAi responses of arthropods and nematodes are highly diverged from the ancestral metazoan state, and that antiviral RNAi may even have evolved independently on multiple occasions.\n\nAuthor summaryThe presence of abundant virus-derived small RNAs in infected plants, fungi, nematodes, and arthropods suggests that Dicer-dependent antiviral RNAi is an ancient and conserved defence. Using metagenomic sequencing from wild-caught organisms we show that antiviral RNAi is highly variable across animals. We identify a distinctive group of virus-derived small RNAs in a mollusc, which have a piRNA-like length distribution but lack key signatures of piRNA biogenesis. We also report a group of 21U virus-derived small RNAs in a brown alga, which represents an origin of multicellularity separate from that of plants, fungi, and animals. The absence of virus-derived small RNAs from our samples may suggest that the majority of animal phyla lack an antiviral RNAi response or that these phyla could possess an antiviral RNAi response resembling that reported for vertebrates, which is not detectable through simple metagenomic sequencing of wild-type individuals. In addition, we report abundant somatic piRNAs across anciently divergent animals suggesting that this is the ancestral state in Bilateria. Our study challenges the widely-held assumption that most invertebrates possess an antiviral RNAi pathway likely similar to that seen in Drosophila, other arthropods, and nematodes.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007533"

Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility, which add to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies and result in failures to replicate (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols). Mitigating these issues requires multi-study datasets and the development of pipelines that can be applied across them. We developed NeuroDatas MRI to Graphs (NDMG) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducability, to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, NDMG ran on 25 different studies ({approx}6,000 scans) from 19 sites, with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from NDMG are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that NDMG is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections. Yet, the magnitude of the differences varied across individuals and studies--much more so when pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study, site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We therefore provide a set of principles to guide the development of pipelines capable of pooling data across studies while maintaining biological variability and minimizing measurement error. This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.","NA"

By applying a dimensionality reduction approach, Probabilistic Estimation of Expression Residuals (PEER), we identified genes that correlated in expression with intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (ECM) factors. However, variation in mRNA levels could not account for outlier cell behaviour. Instead, we identified rare, deleterious SNVs in the coding sequence of genes involved in ECM adhesion that occurred in cell lines that were outliers for one or more phenotypes such as cell spreading. These also correlated with altered germ layer differentiation on micropatterned surfaces. Our study thus establishes a strategy for integrating genetic and cell biological measurements for high-throughput analysis.","NA"

However, even though the achievable spatial resolution in functional MRI has much improved over the years, it is still challenging to separate signals arising from different cortical layers. In this work, we propose a new method to extract laminar signals. We use a spatial General Linear Model in combination with the equivolume principle of cortical layers to unmix laminar signals instead of interpolating through and integrating over a cortical area: thus reducing partial volume effects. Not only do we provide a mathematical framework for extracting laminar signals with a spatial GLM, we also illustrate that the best case scenarios of existing methods can be seen as special cases within the same framework. By means of simulation, we show that this approach has a sharper point spread function, providing better signal localisation. We further assess the partial volume contamination in cortical profiles from high resolution human ex vivo and in vivo structural data, and provide a full account of the benefits and potential caveats. We eschew here any attempt to validate the spatial GLM on the basis of fMRI data as a generally accepted ground-truth pattern of laminar activation does not currently exist. This approach is flexible in terms of the number of layers and their respective thickness, and naturally integrates spatial regularisation along the cortex, while preserving laminar specificity. Care must be taken, however, as this procedure of unmixing is susceptible to sources of noise in the data or inaccuracies in the laminar segmentation.","10.1371/journal.pone.0212493"

Traditional methods for calculating CR use climate controlled chambers and define CR using a fixed budburst percentage, usually close to 50% (CR-50%), without considering the productivity level associated to this percentage. This CR-50% definition may underestimate the real CR of tree crops for optimal productivity. This underestimation is particularly important to consider as winter chill accumulation is declining in many regions due to climate change. In this work we used sweet cherry to analyse the traditional method for calculating CR in many Rosaceae species (CR-50%) and compared the results with more a restrictive, productivity focused method, with CR defined with a 90% bud break level (90%, CRm-90%) close to the optimal budburst which assures productivity. Climate projections of winter chill suitability across Europe using CR-50% and CRm-90% were calculated. Regional suitability landscape was highly dependent on the method used to define CR and differences were found for a wide area of the European geography, both cold and mild winter areas. Our results suggest a need to use an optimal budburst level for the assessment of CR for sweet cherry. The use of traditional methods to determine CR can result in an underestimation of productivity CR with negative consequences for the fruit industry, particularly as climate change advances.","10.1007/s00484-018-1649-5"

To select for WUEplant, an efficient phenotyping method that reports on the genetic contribution of component traits such as transpiration efficiency (TEi; rate of CO2 assimilation per stomatal conductance) must be developed. Leaf carbon stable isotope composition ({delta}13Cleaf) has been proposed as a high-throughput proxy for TEi, and a negative correlation between {delta}13Cleaf and both WUEplant and TEi has previously been demonstrated in several C4 grass species. Therefore, the aim of the research presented here was to determine if the same loci control {delta}13Cleaf, WUEplant, and TEi under well-watered and water-limited conditions in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of closely related C4 grasses Setaria viridis and S. italica. Three quantitative trait loci (QTL) for {delta}13Cleaf were co-localized with transpiration, biomass, and a linear model of WUE. When WUEplant was calculated for allele classes based on the three QTL for {delta}13Cleaf, {delta}13Cleaf was negatively correlated with WUEplant as theory predicts when WUEplant is in part driven by differences in TEi. In any population, multiple traits can influence WUEplant; however, the analysis of {delta}13Cleaf in this RIL population demonstrates that there is genetic control of TEi that significantly contributes to WUEplant. Furthermore, this research suggests that {delta}13Cleaf can be used in marker-assisted breeding to select for TEi and as a tool to better understand the physiology and genetic architecture of TEi and WUEplant in C4 species.\n\nSignificance StatementOverextended water resources and drought are major agricultural problems worldwide. Therefore, selection for increased plant water use efficiency (WUEplant) in food and biofuel crop species is an important trait in plant breeding programs. Leaf carbon isotopic composition ({delta}13Cleaf) has potential as a rapid and effective high throughput phenotyping method for intrinsic transpiration efficiency (TEi), an important leaf-level component trait of WUEplant. Our research shows that {delta}13Cleaf and WUEplant share a common genetic architecture through their shared relationship with TEi. This suggests that {delta}13Cleaf can be used as a screen for TEi in marker-assisted plant breeding programs to improve crop drought resistance and decrease agricultural water consumption.","10.1111/tpj.14696"

Such models typically have a constrained structure and make specific assumptions about the underlying human learning processes; these may make them underfit observed behaviours. Here we suggest an alternative method based on learning-to-learn approaches, using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a flexible family of models that have sufficient capacity to represent the complex learning and decision-making strategies used by humans. In this approach, an RNN is trained to predict the next action that a subject will take in a decision-making task, and in this way, learns to imitate the processes underlying subjects choices and their learning abilities. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach with a new dataset containing behaviour of uni-polar depression (n=34), bipolar (n=33) and control (n=34) participants in a two-armed bandit task. The results indicate that the new approach is better than baseline reinforcement-learning methods in terms of overall performance and its capacity to predict subjects choices. We show that the model can be interpreted using off-policy simulations, and thereby provide a novel clustering of subjects learning processes - something that often eludes traditional approaches to modelling and behavioural analysis.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006903"

Our analyses reveal that Cuscuta experienced accelerated evolution, and Cuscuta and the convolvulaceous morning glory (Ipomoea) shared a common whole-genome triplication event before their divergence. Importantly, C. australis genome harbors only 19805 protein-coding genes, and 11.7% of the conserved orthologs in autotrophic plants are lost in C. australis. Many of these gene loss events likely result from the plants parasitic lifestyle and large changes in its body plan.

Obviously, however, confidence also depends on the physical evidence available in the stimulus as well as on task performance. If prestimulus alpha power has a direct impact on decision confidence, this link should hold independent of variations in stimulus evidence and performance. We tested this assertion in a paradigm where human listeners (n = 17) rated their confidence in the discrimination of the pitch of two identical tones. Lower prestimulus alpha power in the electroencephalogram (EEG) was predictive of higher confidence ratings, but not of the decision outcome (i.e., judging the first or the second tone as being higher in pitch). Importantly, the link between prestimulus alpha power and decision confidence was not mediated by auditory evoked activity. Our findings demonstrate that the link between prestimulus alpha power and decision confidence does not hinge on physical evidence in the stimulus or task performance. Instead, these results speak to a model wherein low prestimulus alpha power increases neural baseline excitability, which is reflected in enhanced stimulus-evoked neural responses and higher confidence.\n\nSignificance statementIn order to understand the mechanistic relevance of neural oscillations for perception, we here relate these directly to changes in human auditory decision confidence. Human subjects rated their confidence in the discrimination of the pitch of two tones, which were, unbeknownst to the listener, physically identical. In the absence of changing evidence in the physical stimulus or changes in task performance, we demonstrate that prestimulus alpha power negatively relates to decision confidence. Our results support a model of cortical alpha oscillations as a proxy for neural baseline excitability in which lower prestimulus alpha power does not lead to more precise but rather to overall amplified neural representations.","10.1111/ejn.14226"

One facet of these disorders is attributed to the disturbance of membrane lipid composition. Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis through changes in membrane phospholipid composition results in activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and causes dramatic translational and transcriptional changes in the cell. To restore cellular homeostasis, the three highly conserved UPR transducers ATF6, IRE1, and PERK mediate cellular processes upon ER stress. The role of the UPR in proteotoxic stress caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins is well understood but much less so under lipid perturbation-induced UPR (UPRLP). We found that genetically disrupted phosphatidylcholine synthesis in C. elegans causes, lipid perturbation, lipid droplet accumulation, and induced ER stress, all hallmarks of NAFLD. Transcriptional profiling of UPRLP animals shows a unique subset of genes modulated in an UPR-dependent manner that is unaffected by proteotoxic stress (UPRPT). Among these, we identified autophagy genes bec-1 and lgg-1 and the lipid droplet-associated lipase atgl-1 to be modulated by IRE-1. Considering the important role of lipid homeostasis and how its impairment contributes to the pathology of metabolic diseases, our data uncovers the indispensable role of a fully functional UPR program in regulating lipid homeostasis in the face of chronic ER stress and lipotoxicity.","10.1242/jcs.217992"

R.","Jesse R Lasky","Pennsylvania State University","2018-03-20",1,"2","new results","evolutionary biology","Co-occurring species often differ in intraspecific genetic diversity, which in turn can affect adaptation in response to environmental change. Specifically, the simultaneous evolutionary responses of co-occurring species to temporal environmental change may influence community dynamics. Local adaptation along environmental gradients combined with gene flow can promote genetic diversity of traits under selection within populations. Here I build off existing quantitative genetic theory to study community dynamics of locally adapted species in response to temporal environmental change. I show that species with greater gene flow have lower equilibrium population size due to maladaptive immigrant genotypes (migration load). However, following abrupt environmental change that leaves all species initially maladapted, high gene flow species adapt faster due to greater standing genetic diversity. As a result, communities may undergo a transient reversal in relative abundance, sometimes only after substantial lag periods. If constant temporal environmental change is applied, the community exhibits a shift toward stable dominance by species with intermediate gene flow. High gene flow species can sometimes increase abundance under environmental change if environmental change supresses superior competitor but lower gene flow species. The community dynamics observed here parallel the purely ecological successional dynamics following disturbances and are analogous to the transient benefit of hypermutator alleles under changing environments. My results demonstrate how interspecific variation in life history can have far-reaching impacts on eco-evolutionary community response to environmental change.","10.1111/eva.12776"

The effect size of PD-off, PD-on and ASD were 0.23, 0.39, and 0.19, respectively.

Using a new inducible knock-in mouse model we report here that Plk1 overexpression does not favor cell proliferation but rather results in abnormal chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, leading to the formation of polyploid cells with reduced proliferative potential. Mechanistically, these cytokinesis defects correlate with defective loading of Cep55 and ESCRT complexes to the abscission bridge during cytokinesis in a Plk1 kinase-dependent manner. In vivo, elevated levels of Plk1 markedly prevent the development of mammary gland tumors induced either by KrasG12D or Her2, in the presence of increased rates of chromosome instability.

Here, we evaluate support for this \""early burst\"" model of adaptive radiation in 14 ecomorphological traits plus body mass for the extant mammalian order Carnivora. Strong support for an early burst adaptive radiation is recovered for molar grinding area, a key proxy for diet. However, we find no evidence for early burst-like dynamics in body mass or multivariate trait data, suggesting a decoupling of evolutionary modes among traits driven by dietary specialization. Furthermore, the signal of an early burst is only recovered for Carnivora, and not in family-level clades. The lack of support for the early burst model of morphological adaptive radiation in previous phylogenetic studies may be a consequence of focusing on the wrong traits at the wrong taxonomic levels. Osborns law predicted that adaptive radiation should be hierarchically structured, and the search for its signature and understanding of its prevalence will require a renewed focus on functional traits and their evolution over higher-level clades.","NA"

This Picamera system was used in combination with a wireless recording system for characterizing neural correlates of space in environments of various sizes up to 16.5 m2. Spatial rate maps generated using the Picamera system showed improved accuracy in estimating spatial firing characteristics of neurons compared to a popular commercial system, due to its better temporal accuracy. The system also showed improved accuracy in estimating head direction cell tuning as well as theta phase precession in place cells. This improved temporal accuracy is crucial for accurately aligning videos from multiple cameras in large spaces and characterizing spatially modulated cells in a large environment.","10.1152/jn.00215.2018"

These synthetic switches have become a powerful tool for gene regulation, allowing modulation of customized phenotypes, overcoming the obstacles of chemical inducers and replacing their use by an inexpensive resource: light. In this work, we implemented FUN-LOV; an optogenetic switch based on the photon-regulated interaction of WC-1 and VVD, two LOV (Light Oxygen Voltage) blue-light photoreceptors from the fungus Neurospora crassa. When tested in yeast, FUN-LOV yields light-controlled gene expression with exquisite temporal resolution, and a broad dynamic range of over 1300-fold, as measured by a luciferase reporter. We also tested the FUN-LOV switch for heterologous protein expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where Western blot analysis confirmed strong induction upon light stimulation, surpassing by 2.5 times the levels achieved with a classic GAL4/galactose chemical inducible system. Additionally, we utilized FUN-LOV to control the ability of yeast cells to flocculate. Light-controlled expression of the flocculin encoding gene FLO1, by the FUN-LOV switch, yielded Flocculation in Light (FIL), whereas the light-controlled expression of the co-repressor TUP1 provided Flocculation in Darkness (FID). Overall, the results revealed the potential of the FUN-LOV optogenetic switch to control two biotechnologically relevant phenotypes such as heterologous protein expression and flocculation, paving the road for the engineering of new yeast strains for industrial applications. Importantly, FUN-LOV s ability to accurately manipulate gene expression, with a high-temporal dynamic range, can be exploited in the analysis of diverse biological processes in various organisms.\n\nImportanceOptogenetic switches are molecular devices which allow the control of different cellular processes by light, such as gene expression, providing a versatile alternative to chemical inducers.

Previous methods for comparing GO terms have relied on the fact that GO terms are organized into a tree structure. In this paradigm, the locations of two GO terms in the tree dictate their similarity score. In this paper, we introduce two new solutions for this problem, by focusing instead on the definitions of the GO terms. We apply neural network based techniques from the natural language processing (NLP) domain. The first method does not rely on the GO tree, whereas the second indirectly depends on the GO tree. In our first approach, we compare two GO definitions by treating them as two unordered sets of words. The word similarity is estimated by a word embedding model that maps words into an N-dimensional space. In our second approach, we account for the word-ordering within a sentence. We use a sentence encoder to embed GO definitions into vectors and estimate how likely one definition entails another. We validate our methods in two ways. In the first experiment, we test the models ability to differentiate a true protein-protein network from a randomly generated network. In the second experiment, we test the model in identifying orthologs from randomly-matched genes in human, mouse, and fly.

One-third of ASD cases may be complicated by the presence of ADHD. Individuals with dual diagnoses face greater barriers to accessing treatment for ADHD and respond less positively to primary pharmacologic interventions. Nonpharmacologic technology-aided tools for hyperactivity and inattention in people with ASD are being developed, although research into their efficacy and safety remains limited.\n\nObjectiveThe objective of this preliminary study was to describe the changes in ADHD-related symptoms in children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD after use of the Empowered Brain system, a behavioral and social communication aid for ASD running on augmented reality smartglasses.\n\nMethodsWe recruited 8 children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD (male to female ratio of 7:1, mean age 15 years, range 11.7-20.5 years) through a Web-based research signup form. The baseline score on the hyperactivity subscale of the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC-H), a measure of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity, determined their classification into a high ADHD-related symptom group (n=4, ABC-H [&ge;]13) and a low ADHD-related symptom group (n=4, ABC-H <13). All participants received an intervention with Empowered Brain, where they used smartglasses-based social communication and behavioral modules while interacting with their caregiver. We then calculated caregiver-reported ABC-H scores at 24 and 48 hours after the session.\n\nResultsAll 8 participants were able to complete the intervention session. Postintervention ABC-H scores were lower for most participants at 24 hours (n=6, 75%) and for all participants at 48 hours (n=8, 100%). At 24 hours after the session, average participant ABC-H scores decreased by 54.9% in the high ADHD symptom group and by 20% in the low ADHD symptom group. At 48 hours after the session, ABC-H scores compared with baseline decreased by 56.4% in the high ADHD symptom group and by 66.3% in the low ADHD symptom group.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides initial evidence for the efficacy of the Empowered Brain system in reducing ADHD-related symptoms, such as hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity, in school-aged children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD. This digital smartglasses intervention can potentially be targeted at a broader array of mental health conditions that exhibit transdiagnostic attentional and social communication deficits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Further research is required to understand the clinical importance of these observed changes and to conduct longitudinal studies on this intervention with larger sample sizes.","10.2196/mental.9631"

CREs are unevenly distributed across the genome, giving rise to distinct subsets such as individual CREs and Clusters Of cis-Regulatory Elements (COREs), also known as super-enhancers. Identifying COREs is a challenge due to technical and biological features that entail variability in the distribution of distances between CREs within a given dataset. To address this issue, we developed a new unsupervised machine learning approach termed Clustering of genomic REgions Analysis Method (CREAM) that outperforms the Ranking Of Super Enhancer (ROSE) approach. Specifically CREAM identified COREs are enriched in CREs strongly bound by master transcription factors according to ChIP-seq signal intensity, are proximal to highly expressed genes, are preferentially found near genes essential for cell growth and are more predictive of cell identity. Moreover, we show that CREAM enables subtyping primary prostate tumor samples according to their CORE distribution across the genome. We further show that COREs are enriched compared to individual CREs at TAD boundaries and these are preferentially bound by CTCF and factors of the cohesin complex (e.g.: RAD21 and SMC3). Finally, using CREAM against transcription factor ChIP-seq reveals CTCF and cohesin-specific COREs preferentially at TAD boundaries compared to intra-TADs. CREAM is available as an open source R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CREAM) to identify COREs from cis-regulatory annotation datasets from any biological samples.","NA"

While reproductive trait variation has been extensively investigated and is well established in mammals, the genetic loci contributing to this variation remain largely unknown. The domestic dog, Canis lupus familiaris is a powerful model for studies of the genetics of inherited disease due to its unique history of domestication. To gain insight into the genetic basis of reproductive traits across domestic dog breeds, we collected phenotypic data for four traits - cesarean section rate (n = 97 breeds), litter size (n = 60), stillbirth rate (n = 57), and gestation length (n = 23) - from primary literature and breeders handbooks. By matching our phenotypic data to genomic data from the Cornell Veterinary Biobank, we performed genome wide association analyses for these four reproductive traits, using body mass and kinship among breeds as co-variates. We identified 14 genome-wide significant associations between these traits and genetic loci, including variants near CACNA2D3 with gestation length, MSRB3 with litter size, SMOC2 with cesarean section rate, MITF with litter size and still birth rate, KRT71 with cesarean section rate, litter size, and stillbirth rate, and HTR2C with stillbirth rate. Some of these loci, such as CACNA2D3 and MSRB3, have been previously implicated in human reproductive pathologies. Many of the variants that we identified have been previously associated with domestication-related traits, including brachycephaly (SMOC2), coat color (MITF), coat curl (KRT71), and tameness (HTR2C). These results raise the hypothesis that the artificial selection that gave rise to dog breeds also shaped the observed variation in their reproductive traits. Overall, our work establishes the domestic dog as a system for studying the genetics of reproductive biology and disease.","10.1093/emph/eoz015"

Here, we have examined the role of two highly conserved yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) histone chaperones, FACT and Spt6, in regulating transcription. We show that the H3 tail contributes to the recruitment of FACT to coding sequences in a manner dependent on acetylation. We found that deleting a H3 HAT Gcn5 or mutating lysines on the H3 tail impairs FACT recruitment at ADH1 and ARG1 genes. However, deleting the H4 tail or mutating the H4 lysines failed to dampen FACT occupancy in coding regions. Additionally, we show that FACT-depletion reduces Pol II occupancy in the 5 ends genome-wide. In contrast, Spt6-depletion leads to reduction in Pol II occupancy towards the 3 end, in a manner dependent on the gene-length. Severe transcription and histone eviction defects were also observed in a strain that was impaired for Spt6 recruitment (spt6{Delta}202) and depleted of FACT. Importantly, the severity of the defect strongly correlated with WT Pol II occupancies at these genes, indicating critical roles of Spt6 and Spt16 in promoting high-level transcription. Collectively, our results show that both FACT and Spt6 are important for transcription globally and may participate during different stages of transcription.","10.1534/genetics.118.300943"

Importantly, we show that during substrate transport, a simple conformational change in Mup1 mediates rapid relocation into a unique disperse network at the PM. Clustered Mup1 is protected from turnover, whereas relocated Mup1 actively recruits the endocytic machinery thereby initiating its own turnover.

Often these transcripts are processed (spliced, capped, polyadenylated) and some are known to have important biological functions. However, most lncRNAs have unknown or poorly understood functions. Nevertheless, because of their potential role in cancer, lncRNAs are receiving a lot of attention, and the need for computational tools to predict their possible mechanisms of action is more than ever. Fundamentally, most of the known lncRNA mechanisms involve RNA-RNA and/or RNA-protein interactions. Through accurate predictions of each kind of interaction and integration of these predictions, it is possible to elucidate potential mechanisms for a given lncRNA.\n\nApproachHere we introduce MechRNA, a pipeline for corroborating RNA-RNA interaction prediction and protein binding prediction for identifying possible lncRNA mechanisms involving specific targets or on a transcriptome-wide scale. The first stage uses a version of IntaRNA2 with added functionality for efficient prediction of RNA-RNA interactions with very long input sequences, allowing for large-scale analysis of lncRNA interactions with little or no loss of optimality. The second stage integrates protein binding information pre-computed by GraphProt, for both the lncRNA and the target. The final stage involves inferring the most likely mechanism for each lncRNA/target pair. This is achieved by generating candidate mechanisms from the predicted interactions, the relative locations of these interactions and correlation data, followed by selection of the most likely mechanistic explanation using a combined p-value.\n\nResultsWe applied MechRNA on a number of recently identified cancer-related lncRNAs (PCAT1, PCAT29, ARLnc1) and also on two well-studied lncRNAs (PCA3 and 7SL). This led to the identification of hundreds of high confidence potential targets for each lncRNA and corresponding mechanisms. These predictions include the known competitive mechanism of 7SL with HuR for binding on the tumor suppressor TP53, as well as mechanisms expanding what is known about PCAT1 and ARLn1 and their targets BRCA2 and AR, respectively.

Tactile signals relayed during physical contact between males and females before and during mating appear to be important for mate choice and reproductive isolation in some animals. However, compared to our understanding of visual, auditory, and chemical signals, we know little about the importance of tactile signals in mating decisions. Among North American damselflies in the genus Enallagma (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) species-specific tactile stimulation contributes to reproductive isolation between species and may also be important for intraspecific mate choice. We quantified several mechanosensory sensilla phenotypes on the female thorax among multiple sympatric and allopatric populations of two Enallagma species that occasionally interbreed in nature. Although each species differed in features of sensilla distribution within the thoracic plates, we found no strong evidence of reproductive character displacement among the sensilla traits we measured in regions of sympatry. However, substantial variation of sensilla traits was observed within populations of both species. Our results suggest that species-specific placement of female mechanoreceptors appears sufficient for species recognition, but mechanosensor variation among females within species may be important for mate choice.","10.1002/ece3.4669"

Our results reveal evidence of non-random, but polyphyletic clustering of Aedes and Ochlerotatus species, with a monophyletic outgroup. We do find support for the validity of Ochlerotatus as an evolutionary unit, although we find insufficient evidence to support its retention as a genus. We suggest that mosquito phylogenetic analyses incorporate a greater number of genetic markers to help clarify our understanding of Aedini species classifications, but caution that recent assessments based solely on morphology may be insufficient.","NA"

This approach tested whether single RVs were shared by all sequenced affected family members. However, as with other study designs, joint analysis of several RVs (e.g. within genes) is sometimes required to obtain sufficient statistical power. Further, phenocopies can lead to false negatives for some causal RVs if complete sharing among affecteds is required. Here we extend our methodology (Rare Variant Sharing, RVS) to address these issues. Specifically, we introduce gene-based analyses, refine RV definition based on haplotypes, and introduce a partial sharing test based on RV sharing probabilities for subsets of affected family members. RVS also has the desirable features of not requiring external estimates of variant frequency or control samples, provides functionality to assess and address violations of key assumptions, and is available as open source software for genome-wide analysis. Simulations including phenocopies, based on the families of an oral cleft study, revealed the partial and complete sharing versions of RVS achieved similar statistical power compared to alternative methods (RareIBD and the Gene-Based Segregation Test), and had superior power compared to the pedigree Variant Annotation, Analysis and Search Tool (pVAAST) linkage statistic. In studies of multiplex cleft families, analysis of rare single nucleotide variants in the exome of 151 affected relatives from 54 families revealed no significant excess sharing in any one gene, but highlighted different patterns of sharing revealed by the complete and partial sharing tests.","10.1002/gepi.22155"

The study of the breakdown of these molecules is thus a central question in biology. Surprisingly, plant cell wall breakdown by herbivores is relatively poorly understood, as nearly all early work focused on the mechanisms used by symbiotic microbes to breakdown plant cell walls in insects such as termites. Recently, however, it has been shown that many organisms make endogenous cellulases. Insects, and other arthropods, in particular have been shown to express a variety of plant cell wall degrading enzymes in many gene families with the ability to break down all the major components of the plant cell wall. Here we report the genome of a walking stick, Medauroidea extradentata, an obligate herbivore that makes uses of endogenously produced plant cell wall degrading enzymes. We present a draft of the 3.3Gbp genome along with an official gene set that contains a diversity of plant cell wall degrading enzymes. We show that at least one of the major families of plant cell wall degrading enzymes, the pectinases, have undergone a striking lineage-specific gene family expansion in the Phasmatodea. This genome will be a useful resource for comparative evolutionary studies with herbivores in many other clades and will help elucidate the mechanisms by which metazoans breakdown plant cell wall components.\n\nData availabilityThe Medauroidea extradentata genome assembly, Med v1.0, is available for download via NCBI (Bioproject: PRJNA369247).

We dissected neuronal substrates underlying the identified habituation deficits and integrated genotype-phenotype annotations, gene ontologies and interaction networks to determine the clinical features and molecular processes that are associated with habituation deficits.\n\nResultsWe identified more than 100 genes required for habituation learning. For the vast majority of these, 93 genes, a role in habituation learning was previously unknown. These genes characterize ID disorders with overgrowth/macrocephaly and comorbid ASD. Moreover, ASD individuals from the Simons Simplex Collection carrying disruptive de novo mutations in these genes exhibit increased rates of specific aberrant behaviors including stereotypic speech, hyperactivity and irritability. At the molecular level, ID genes required for normal habituation are enriched in synaptic function and converge on Ras-MAPK signaling. Both increased Ras-MAPK signaling in GABAergic and decreased Ras-MAPK signaling in cholinergic neurons specifically inhibit the adaptive habituation response.\n\nConclusionsOur work demonstrates the relevance of habituation learning to autism, identifies an unprecedented number of novel habituation players, supports an emerging role for inhibitory neurons in habituation and reveals an opposing, circuit-level-based mechanism for Ras-MAPK signaling.

During unimanual movements, activity in the contralateral hemisphere is increased while the ipsilateral hemisphere is suppressed below resting baseline. Despite this suppression, unimanual movements can be decoded from ipsilateral activity alone. This indicates that ipsilateral activity patterns represent parameters of ongoing movement, but the origin and functional relevance of these representations is unclear. Here, we asked whether human ipsilateral representations are caused by active movement, or whether they are driven by sensory input. Participants alternated between performing single finger presses and having fingers passively stimulated, while we recorded brain activity using high-field (7T) functional imaging. We contrasted active and passive finger representations in sensorimotor areas of ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Finger representations in the contralateral hemisphere were equally strong under passive and active conditions, highlighting the importance of sensory information in feedback control. In contrast, ipsilateral finger representations were stronger during active presses. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of finger representations differed between hemispheres: the contralateral hemisphere showed the strongest finger representations in Brodmann area 3a and 3b, while the ipsilateral hemisphere exhibited stronger representations in premotor and parietal areas. This suggests that finger representations in the two hemispheres have different origins - contralateral representations are driven by both active movement and sensory stimulation, whereas ipsilateral representations are mainly engaged during active movement. This suggests that a possible contribution of the ipsilateral hemisphere lies in movement planning, rather than in the dexterous feedback control of the movement.\n\nSignificance statementMovements of the human body are mostly controlled by contralateral cortical regions. However, activity in ipsilateral sensorimotor regions is also modulated during active movements. The origin and functional relevance of these ipsilateral representations is unclear. Here we used high-field neuroimaging to investigate how human contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres represent active finger presses and passive finger stimulation. We report that while the contralateral hemisphere was equally strongly recruited during active and passive conditions, the ipsilateral hemisphere was mostly recruited during active movement.

The circuit mechanisms underlying cortical LTP remain unclear. In the mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), LTP can be elicited in layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons by rhythmic whisker stimulation. We combined electrophysiology, optogenetics, and chemogenetics in thalamocortical slices to dissect the synaptic circuitry underlying this LTP. We found that projections from higher-order, posteriormedial thalamic complex (POm) to S1 are key to eliciting NMDAR-dependent LTP of intracortical synapses. Paired activation of intracortical and higher-order thalamocortical pathways increased vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interneuron and decreased somatostatin (SST) interneuron activity, which was critical for inducing LTP. Our results reveal a novel circuit motif in which higher-order thalamic feedback gates plasticity of intracortical synapses in S1 via disinhibition.

So, when new visual information arrives unexpectedly, how are those plans affected? At what point can the new information start guiding an eye movement, and how? Here, based on modeling and simulation results, we make two observations that are relevant to these questions. First, we note that many experiments, including those investigating the phenomenon known as \""saccadic inhibition,\"" are consistent with the idea that sudden-onset stimuli briefly interrupt the gradual rise in neural activity associated with the preparation of an impending saccade. And second, we show that this stimulus-driven interruption is functionally adaptive, but only if perception is fast. In that case, putting on hold an ongoing saccade plan toward location A allows the oculomotor system to initiate a concurrent, alternative plan toward location B (where a stimulus just appeared), deliberate (briefly) on the priority of each target, and determine which plan should continue. Based on physiological data, we estimate that the actual advantage of this strategy, relative to one in which any plan once initiated must be completed, is of several tens of milliseconds.","NA"

The strong debittering power of rainbow trout extract was further confirmed by the debittering experiments on salmon bone soup and bitter melon, both with perfect results.\n\nCONCLUSIONThese results indicated that the cod bone soup bitterness comes not only from bitter peptide but also from other substances that can be masked by trout extract.

Recently it has been used for scaffolding contigs and assembly validation for large-scale sequencing projects, including the maize [32], goat [6], and amborella [4] genomes. However, a major impediment in the use of this data is the variety and quantity of errors in the raw optical mapping data, which are called Rmaps. The challenges associated with using Rmap data are analogous to dealing with insertions and deletions in the alignment of long reads. Moreover, they are arguably harder to tackle since the data is numerical and susceptible to inaccuracy. We develop cOMet to error correct Rmap data, which to the best of our knowledge is the only optical mapping error correction method. Our experimental results demonstrate that cOMet has high prevision and corrects 82.49% of insertion errors and 77.38% of deletion errors in Rmap data generated from the E. coli K-12 reference genome. Out of the deletion errors corrected, 98.26% are true errors. Similarly, out of the insertion errors corrected, 82.19% are true errors. It also successfully scales to large genomes, improving the quality of 78% and 99% of the Rmaps in the plum and goat genomes, respectively. Lastly, we show the utility of error correction by demonstrating how it improves the assembly of Rmap data.

However, despite a long history of making significant advances in our understanding natural selection and evolution, the field of pollination biology has largely studied pollen movement indirectly (e.g., pollen analogues or paternity assignment to seeds) due to a lack of suitable pollen tracking methods. Here, we develop and test a novel pollen-tracking technique using quantum dots as pollen-grain labels. Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals so small in size that they behave like artificial atoms. When exposed to UV light, they emit extremely bright light in a range of different colours. Their photostability, broad excitation range, and customisable binding-li-gands make quantum dots ideal bio-labels. We tested the suitability of CuInSexS2-x/ZnS (core/shell) quantum dots with oleic acid (zinc-oleate complex) ligands as pollen-grain labels. We found that quantum dots attach to pollen grains of four different species even after agitation in a polar solvent, suggesting that the oleic acid ligands on quantum dots bind to pollenkitt surrounding pollen grains. We also showed that most pollen grains within anthers of the same four species are labelled with quantum dots after applying sufficient quantum-dot solution to anthers. To test whether quantum-dot pollen-labels influenced pollen transport, we conducted pollen transfer trials on Sparaxis villosa (Iridaceae) using captively reared honeybees. We found no difference in pollen transport between labelled and unlabelled pollen grains. Our experiments therefore demonstrate the potential for quantum dots to be used as easily applied pollen labels, which allow subsequent tracking of the fates of pollen grains in the field. The ability to track pollen grain movement in situ, may finally allow us to address an historically neglected aspect of plant reproductive ecology and evolution.","NA"

Here, we first introduce a multi-task learning approach to jointly impute gene expression in 44 human tissues. Compared with single-tissue methods, our approach achieved an average 39% improvement in imputation accuracy and generated effective imputation models for an average 120% (range 13%-339%) more genes in each tissue.

We studied regional neural activity when people watched a movie that had varying saliency of a novel or an anticipated flow of salient events. Using intracranial electroencephalography from ten patients, we observed that high-frequency activity (50-150 Hz) in the hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral PFC), and medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) tracked event saliency.

A widely used approach for DFC estimation is the computation of the sliding window correlation between blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals from different brain regions. Although the source of temporal fluctuations in DFC estimates remains largely unknown, there is growing evidence that they may reflect dynamic shifts between functional brain networks. At the same time, recent findings suggest that DFC estimates might be prone to the influence of nuisance factors such as the physiological modulation of the BOLD signal. Therefore, nuisance regression is used in many DFC studies to regress out the effects of nuisance terms prior to the computation of DFC estimates. In this work we examined the relationship between DFC estimates and nuisance factors. We found that DFC estimates were significantly correlated with temporal fluctuations in the magnitude (norm) of various nuisance regressors, with significant correlations observed in the majority (76%) of the cases examined. Significant correlations between the DFC estimates and nuisance regressor norms were found even when the underlying correlations between the nuisance and fMRI time courses were relatively small. We then show that nuisance regression does not eliminate the relationship between DFC estimates and nuisance norms, with significant correlations observed in the majority (71%) of the cases examined after nuisance regression. We present theoretical bounds on the difference between DFC estimates obtained before and after nuisance regression and relate these bounds to limitations in the efficacy of nuisance regression with regards to DFC estimates.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.024"

Method variability is commonly minimized by optimizing sampling procedures through computer simulations. Inter-subject variability is inherent in the population of interest and cannot be acted upon. In contrast, intra-subject variability introduced by confounds cannot be simply quantified from experimental data, as this data also includes method variability. Therefore, this aspect is generally neglected when developing assessments. Yet, comparing method variability and intra-subject variability could give insights on whether effort should be invested in optimizing the sampling procedure, or in addressing potential confounds instead. We propose a new approach to estimate and model intra-subject variability of psychometric functions by combining computer simulations and behavioral data, and to account for it when simulating experiments. The approach was illustrated in a real-world scenario of proprioceptive difference threshold assessments. The behavioral study revealed a test-retest reliability of 0.212. Computer simulations lacking intra-subject variability predicted a reliability of 0.768, whereas the new approach including an intra-subject variability model lead to a realistic estimate of reliability (0.207). Such a model also allows computing the theoretically maximally attainable reliability (0.552) assuming an ideal sampling procedure. Comparing the reliability estimates when exclusively accounting for method variability versus intra-subject variability reveals that intra-subject variability should be reduced by addressing confounds and that only optimizing the sampling procedure may be insufficient to achieve a high reliability. The new approach also allows accelerating the development of assessments by simulating the converging behavior of the reliability confidence interval with a large number of subjects and retests without requiring additional experiments. Having such a tool of predictive value is especially important for target populations where time is scarce, such as for assessments in clinical settings.","10.1371/journal.pone.0209839"

Systematic sensitivity analysis with WACNI was used to classify the source, sink and transport related molecular processes into four categories, i.e. universal yield enhancers, universal yield inhibitors, conditional yield enhancers and weak yield regulators. Simulations using WACNI further show that even without a major change in leaf photosynthetic properties, 54.6% to 73% grain yield increase can be potentially achieved by optimizing these molecular processes during the rice grain filling period while simply combining all the  superior molecular modules together cannot achieve the optimal yield level. A common macroscopic feature in all these designed high-yield lines is that they all show  a sustained and steady growth of grain sink, which might be used as a generic selection criteria in high-yield rice breeding. Overall, WACNI can serve as a tool to facilitate plant source sink interaction research and guide future crops breeding by design.\n\nOne sentence summaryA mechanistic model of source, sink flow model is developed and used to demonstrate that optimization of the whole plant carbon nitrogen metabolism can dramatically increase crop yield potential.","NA"

Using 405 whole-genome sequences from four sub-Saharan African populations, we provide complementary lines of evidence for archaic introgression into these populations. Our analyses of site frequency spectra indicate that these populations derive 2-19% of their genetic ancestry from an archaic population that diverged prior to the split of Neanderthals and modern humans. Using a method that can identify segments of archaic ancestry without the need for reference archaic genomes, we built genome-wide maps of archaic ancestry in the Yoruba and the Mende populations that recover about 482 and 502 megabases of archaic sequence, respectively. Analyses of these maps reveal segments of archaic ancestry at high frequency in these populations that represent potential targets of adaptive introgression. Our results reveal the substantial contribution of archaic ancestry in shaping the gene pool of present-day African populations.

Evidence for a circadian clock, entrainable by cyclic environmental stimuli, exists for periodic changing temperature and light as zeitgeber. Whether seasonality follows from the existence of a circadian clock - which is a necessary requirement for annual rhythms - remains unknown.\n\nDue to an accidental observation, we were able to show that fermentation taking place in complete darkness and at constant temperature is influenced in some yeast strains by the history of the inoculum culture. Using yeast cultures growing on agar plates and exposed to diffuse daylight for three weeks either in March or in May as inoculum, leads to significantly different fermentation rates in the inoculated grape juice in both months: rates are higher in March when day length is shorter than in May. In must inoculated with cultures that grew in darkness or daylight, respectively, higher fermentation rates occur by the former. Other yeast strains react to artificial white light in the same way.\n\nWe used strains of S. cerevisiae, S. eubayanus, S. kudriavzevii, S. uvarum and furthermore hybrid strains of two or even three of these species. The most pronounced reaction to daylight was shown by the S. eubayanus x S. uvarum x S. cerevisiae hybrid, followed by S. cerevisiae x S. kudriavzevii hybrids, S. eubayanus and S. cerevisiae. S. uvarum was sensitive to artificial white light.\n\nThese observations can hardly be explained by some kind of photo damage because they base on an effect that persists through many cell division cycles after yeasts were exposed to light. If it really represents seasonality epigenetic memory is likely involved, since fermentation lasts for many days and yeast generations. If the existence of a circadian clock and seasonal behaviour in Saccharomyces is confirmed these yeasts could become an important tool in basic research concerning epigenetic memory.","NA"

As the number of studies investigating these associations increases and the number of subjects in each study increases, a meta-analysis to identify the associations that are the most predictive of disease progression is warranted. We analyzed previously published 16S rRNA gene sequencing data collected from feces and colon tissue. We quantified the odds ratios (ORs) for individual bacterial taxa that were associated with an individual having tumors relative to a normal colon. Among the fecal samples, there were no taxa that had significant ORs associated with adenoma and there were 8 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Similarly, among the tissue samples, there were no taxa that had a significant OR associated with adenoma and there were 3 taxa with significant ORs associated with carcinoma. Among the significant ORs, the association between individual taxa and tumor diagnosis was equal or below 7.11. Because individual taxa had limited association with tumor diagnosis, we trained Random Forest classification models using only the taxa that had significant ORs, using the entire collection of taxa found in each study, and using operational taxonomic units defined based on a 97% similarity threshold. All training approaches yielded similar classification success as measured using the Area Under the Curve. The ability to correctly classify individuals with adenomas was poor and the ability to classify individuals with carcinomas was considerably better using sequences from fecal or tissue.\n\nImportanceColorectal cancer is a significant and growing health problem in which animal models and epidemiological data suggest that the colonic microbiota have a role in tumorigenesis. These observations indicate that the colonic microbiota is a reservoir of biomarkers that may improve our ability to detect colonic tumors using non-invasive approaches. This meta-analysis identifies and validates a set of 8 bacterial taxa that can be used within a Random Forest modeling framework to differentiate individuals as having normal colons or carcinomas. When models trained using one dataset were tested on other datasets, the models performed well. These results lend support to the use of fecal biomarkers for the detection of tumors. Furthermore, these biomarkers are plausible candidates for further mechanistic studies into the role of the gut microbiota in tumorigenesis.","10.1128/mBio.00630-18"

We found that a subset of PFC neurons were strongly driven by auditory stimuli even when the stimulus had no associative meaning, suggesting PFC monitors stimuli under passive conditions.

Studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, in which the development and function of neural circuits can be interrogated with single cell resolution, have revealed two general developmental mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in the nervous system. The first involves the acquisition of sexually dimorphic features in sex-shared neurons during sexual maturation, which include changes in terminal gene expression, such as odorant receptors, neurotransmitters and synaptic regulators [4-10]. The second mechanism involves the generation of sex-specific neurons [11-13]. This requires sex-specific cell death [14]or neurogenesis events resulting from extensive sex differences in the cell division patterns and neurodevelopmental programmes of post-embryonic cell lineages (reviewed in [3]). Here we identify a third, novel way to generate sexual dimorphism in the nervous system. We find that during sexual maturation (L4 stage), a class of sex-shared glial cells acquires sexually dimorphic function by undergoing a direct glia-to-neuron transdifferentiation that results in the production of male-specific neurons. This plasticity is regulated cell-intrinsically by the sex-determination pathway. These previously unnoticed neurons, which we term PHDs, are putative proprioceptors that regulate male locomotion during specific steps of mating. One of these steps is a novel readjustment movement performed when intromission becomes difficult to achieve. Our results reveal sex-specific direct transdifferentiation as a novel mechanism for generating sex-specific neurons and also show the importance of proprioceptive feedback during the complex steps of mating for successful reproduction.","NA"

First, we validate the ability of known and novel chemoproteomic probes to report on fumarate reactivity in vitro. Next, we apply these probes in concert with LC-MS/MS to identify cysteine residues sensitive to either fumarate treatment or fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation in untransformed and human HLRCC cell models, respectively.

Superinfection, the sequential infection of a single cell by two or more virions, plays an important role in determining the replicative and evolutionary potential of IAV populations. The prevalence of superinfection during natural infection, and the specific mechanisms that regulate it, remain poorly understood. Here, we used a novel single virion infection approach to directly assess the effects of individual IAV genes on superinfection efficiency. Rather than implicating a specific viral gene, this approach revealed that superinfection susceptibility is determined by the total number of viral genes expressed, independent of their identity. IAV particles that expressed a complete set of viral genes potently inhibit superinfection, while semi-infectious particles (SIPs) that express incomplete subsets of viral genes do not. As a result, virus populations that contain more SIPs undergo more frequent superinfection. These findings identify both a major determinant of IAV superinfection potential and a prominent role for SIPs in promoting viral co-infection.","10.1128/mbio.01761-18"

To better understand this dynamic and complex process we have asked what the role of two highly conserved cysteine residues are in the C-terminal domain of VP40. Here we report that the mutation of Cys311 to alanine increases VP40 membrane binding affinity for phosphatidylserine containing membranes. C311A has a significant increase in binding to PS compared to WT, has longer virus like particles, and displays evidence of increased budding. C314A also has an increase in PS binding compared to WT, however to a lesser extent. The double Cys mutant shares the phenotypes of the single mutants with increased binding to PS. Computational studies demonstrate these Cys residues, Cys311 in particular, restrain a loop segment containing Lys residues that interact with the plasma membrane. Mutation of Cys311 promotes membrane binding loop flexibility, alters internal VP40 H-bonding, and increases PS binding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of mutations that increase VP40 affinity for biological membranes and the length of EBOV virus like particles. Together, our findings indicate these residues are important for membrane dynamics at the plasma membrane via the interaction with phosphatidylserine.","NA"

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the general roles of the mechanosensory neurons have been defined, but most studies involve end-point or single-time-point measurements, and thus lack dynamical information. Here, we formulate a set of unbiased quantitative characterizations of the mechanosensory system by using reverse correlation analysis on behavior. We use a custom tracking, selective illumination, and optogenetics platform to compare two mechanosensory systems: the gentle-touch (TRNs) and harsh-touch (PVD) circuits. This method yields characteristic linear filters that allow for prediction of behavioral responses. The resulting filters are consistent with previous findings, and further provide new insights on the dynamics and spatial encoding of the systems. Our results suggest that the tiled network of the gentle-touch neurons has better resolution for spatial encoding than the harsh-touch neurons.

Furthermore, this platform can be extended to capture the behavioral dynamics induced by any neuron or other excitable cells in the animal.\n\nAuthor SummaryAnimals constantly integrate the activity of neurons throughout their bodies to choose the most appropriate behavior. A key goal in quantitative neuroscience is to characterize and predict how neuronal circuits control and modulate behavior. C. elegans, a nematode with a fully mapped connectome, is an ideal model organism for elucidating the links between neuronal circuits and behavior. However, many studies relating activity in neurons to behavior rely on spontaneous behavior and lack information about their dynamics. In this study, we formulate unbiased quantitative characterizations of sensory neurons in C. elegans using with reverse correlation analysis with a white noise stimulus. We use optogenetics to stimulate body touch sensory neurons in freely moving worms, and provide quantitative descriptions that capture the dynamic transformations between sensory neuron activity and behavioral outputs. Our results are consistent with previous findings, and additionally provide new insights on the spatial encoding of these systems.

Members of the species fall along a continuum, from pathovars which cause gastrointestinal infection and low mortality, associated with a broad host-range, to those that cause invasive infection and high mortality, associated with a narrowed host range. Our random forest classifier learned to perfectly discriminate long-established gastrointestinal and invasive serovars of Salmonella.

We dissect the architecture of the model to identify the genes that were most informative of phenotype, revealing a common theme of degradation of metabolic pathways in extraintestinal lineages.

We observed correlations representing known interactions among abundant phytoplankton rRNA sequences, demonstrating the biogeochemical and ecological relevance of such interactions: 1) The kleptochloroplastidic ciliate Mesodinium 18S rRNA gene sequences and a single Teleaulax taxon (via 16S rRNA gene sequences) were correlated (Spearman r =0.83) yet uncorrelated to a Teleaulax 18S rRNA gene OTU, or any other taxon (consistent with a kleptochloroplastidic or karyoklepty relationship) and 2) the photosynthetic prymnesiophyte Braarudosphaera bigelowii and two strains of diazotrophic cyanobacterium UCYN-A were correlated and each taxon was also correlated to other taxa, including B. bigelowii to a verrucomicrobium and a dictyochophyte phytoplankter (all r > 0.8). We also report strong correlations (r > 0.7) between various ciliates, bacteria, and phytoplankton, suggesting interactions via currently unknown mechanisms. These data reiterate the utility of high-frequency time-series to show rapid microbial reactions to stimuli, and provide new information about in-situ dynamics of previously recognized and hypothesized interactions.","10.1038/s41396-018-0169-y"

We demonstrate, for the first time, oppositional effects of imprinted genes on brain and behavior. Specifically, here we show that mice lacking paternal Grb10 make fewer impulsive choices, with no dissociable effects on a separate measure of impulsive action. Taken together with previous work showing that mice lacking maternal Nesp55 make more impulsive choices this suggests that impulsive choice behavior is a substrate for the action of genomic imprinting. Moreover, the contrasting effect of these two genes suggests impulsive choices are subject to intra-genomic conflict and that maternal and paternal interests pull this behavior in opposite directions. Finally, these data may also indicate that an imbalance in expression of imprinted genes contributes to pathological conditions such as gambling and drug addiction, where impulsive behavior becomes maladaptive.","NA"

When applied to human repertoires, Ig-seq provides insight into fundamental immunological questions, and can be implemented in diagnostic and drug discovery projects. However, a major challenge in Ig-seq is ensuring accuracy, as library preparation protocols and sequencing platforms can introduce substantial errors and bias that compromise immunological interpretation. Here, we have established an approach for performing highly accurate human Ig-seq by combining synthetic standards with a comprehensive error and bias correction pipeline. First, we designed a set of 85 synthetic antibody heavy chain standards (in vitro transcribed RNA) to assess correction workflow fidelity. Next, we adapted a library preparation protocol that incorporates unique molecular identifiers (UIDs) for error and bias correction which, when applied to the synthetic standards, resulted in highly accurate data. Finally, we performed Ig-seq on purified human circulating B cell subsets (naive and memory), combined with a cellular replicate sampling strategy. This strategy enabled robust and reliable estimation of key repertoire features such as clonotype diversity, germline segment and isotype subclass usage, and somatic hypermutation (SHM). We anticipate that our standards and error and bias correction pipeline will become a valuable tool for researchers to validate and improve accuracy in human Ig-seq studies, thus leading to potentially new insights and applications in human antibody repertoire profiling.","10.3389/fimmu.2018.01401"

One key trait comprises the occurrence of divorce versus mate-fidelity across sequential reproductive attempts. If divorce represents an evolving behavioural strategy it must have non-zero individual repeatability and heritability, but quantitative estimates from wild populations are scarce. We used 39 years of individual breeding records and pedigree data from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to quantify sex-specific permanent individual and additive genetic variances, and hence estimate repeatability and heritability, in liability for divorce. We estimated moderate repeatability in females, but little repeatability in males. Estimates of additive genetic variance were small in both sexes, and the cross-sex genetic covariance was close to zero. However, the total heritability was likely non-zero but small, indicating low potential for micro-evolutionary response to selection. Rapid micro-evolution of divorce rate therefore appears unlikely, even if there were substantial fitness benefits of divorce and resulting selection.","10.1098/rsbl.2018.0061"

Yet, sleep is known to be essential for brain maturation and a key factor for good academic performance, and thus is particularly critical during childhood and adolescence. While previous studies reported correlations between SED use and sleep impairments, the causal relationship between SED use and sleep in adolescents remains unclear. Using actigraphy and daily questionnaires in a large sample of students (12 to 19 years old), we assessed SED use and sleep habits over one month, including a two-week baseline phase and a two-week interventional phase, where participants were asked to stop screen use after 9 pm during pre-school nights. During the interventional phase, we found that reduction in time spent on SED after 9 pm correlated with earlier sleep onset time and increased total sleep duration. The latter led to improved daytime vigilance. We also observed that the beneficial impact of the intervention on sleep was influenced by catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism, which is implicated in the dopaminergic modulation of human behaviors, including wake and sleep regulation. These findings provide evidence that restricting SED use in the evening represents a valid and promising approach for improving sleep duration in adolescents, with potential implications for daytime functioning and health.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWith the emergence of smartphones and other connected devices, adolescents spend a lot of time on screen electronic devices (SED), especially during the evening. We report that time spent on SED after 9 pm negatively correlates with sleep onset time, sleep duration as well as mood, body weight, and academic performance. Such observable correlations urge for educational strategies to address the chronic lack of sleep observed in todays adolescent populations. Here we also show that limiting the use of SED after 9 pm improves sleep duration and daytime vigilance in most adolescents. This simple education recommendation pertaining to sleep hygiene can be implemented by every household, yielding direct positive effects on sleep, and presumed benefits for health and daytime functioning.","NA"

A central question is how does the nervous system adapt to disturbances in natural conditions when exactly the same movements cannot be practiced several times. Because motor commands and sensory feedback together carry continuous information about limb dynamics, we hypothesized that the nervous system could adapt to unexpected disturbances online. We tested this hypothesis in two reaching experiments during which velocity-dependent force fields were randomly applied. We found that within-movement feedback corrections gradually improved, despite the fact that the perturbations were unexpected. Moreover, when participants were instructed to stop at a via-point, the application of a force field prior to the via-point induced mirror-image after-effects after the via-point, consistent with within-trial adaptation to the unexpected dynamics. These findings suggest a fast time-scale of motor learning, which complements feedback control and supports adaptation of an ongoing movement.

Significance StatementAn important function of the nervous system is to adapt motor commands in anticipation of predictable disturbances, which supports motor learning when we move in novel environments such as force fields. Here we show that movement control when exposed to unpredictable disturbances exhibit similar traits: motor corrections become tuned to the force field, and they evoke after effects within an ongoing sequence of movements. We propose and discuss the framework of adaptive control to explain these results: a real-time learning algorithm, which complements feedback control in the presence of model errors. This candidate model potentially links movement control and trial-by-trial adaptation of motor commands.","10.1523/ENEURO.0149-19.2019"

To complement experimental approaches, in silico methods are available to investigate protein-protein interactions. Cross-docking methods, in particular, can be used to predict protein binding sites.

We evaluate the binding site predictions obtained using complete cross-docking simulations of 358 proteins with two different scoring schemes accounting for multiple binding sites. Despite overall good binding site prediction performances, 68 cases were still associated with very low prediction quality, presenting individual area under the specificity-sensitivity ROC curve (AUC) values below the random AUC threshold of 0.5, since cross-docking calculations can lead to the identification of alternate protein binding sites (that are different from the reference experimental sites). For the large majority of these proteins, we show that the predicted alternate binding sites correspond to interaction sites with hidden partners, i.e. partners not included in the original cross-docking dataset. Among those new partners, we find proteins, but also nucleic acid molecules.

The methods used were tested using short sequence reads for L. braziliensis M2904 against its published reference as a comparison. This assembly and annotation pipeline identified 70 additional genes not annotated on the original M2904 reference. Phylogenetic and evolutionary comparisons of L. guyanensis and L. naiffi with ten other Viannia genomes revealed four traits common to all Viannia: aneuploidy, 22 orthologous groups of genes absent in other Leishmania subgenera, elevated TATE transposon copies, and a high NADH-dependent fumarate reductase gene copy number. Within the Viannia, there were limited structural changes in genome architecture specific to individual species: a 45 Kb amplification on chromosome 34 was present in all bar L. lainsoni, L. naiffi had a higher copy number of the virulence factor leishmanolysin, and laboratory isolate L. shawi M8408 had a possible minichromosome derived from the 3 end of chromosome 34.

To that end, paradigms have used high-intensity strictly-periodic visual stimulation that created strong predictions about future stimulus occurrences and repeatedly demonstrated perceptual consequences in line with an entrainment of parieto-occipital alpha. Our study, in turn, examined the case of alpha entrainment by non-predictive low-intensity quasi-periodic visual stimulation within theta-(4 - 7 Hz), alpha-(8 - 13 Hz) and beta (14 - 20 Hz) frequency bands, i.e. a class of stimuli that resemble the temporal characteristics of naturally occurring visual input more closely. We have previously reported substantial neural phase-locking in EEG recording during all three stimulation conditions. Here, we studied to what extent this phase-locking reflected an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms in the same dataset. Specifically, we tested whether quasi-periodic visual stimulation affected several properties of parieto-occipital alpha generators. Speaking against an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms by non-predictive low-intensity quasi-periodic visual stimulation, we found none of these properties to show differences between stimulation frequency bands. In particular, alpha band generators did not show increased sensitivity to alpha band stimulation and Bayesian inference corroborated evidence against an influence of stimulation frequency. Our results set boundary conditions for when and how to expect effects of entrainment of alpha generators and suggest that the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm may be more inert to external influences than previously thought.","10.1111/ejn.13935"

More worthy of attention is the point that our current understanding of it cannot clearly indicate which of these phenomenological scales are the significant contributors to the brains function and primary output (i.e. behaviour). Apart from the sheer complexity of the problem, a major contributing factor to this state of affairs is the lack of instrumentation that can simultaneously address these multiple scales without causing function altering damages to the underlying tissue. One important facet of this problem is that standard neural recording devices normally require one output connection per electrode. This limits the number of electrodes that can fit along the thin shafts of implantable probes generating a limiting balance between density and spread. Sharing a single output connection between multiple electrodes relaxes this constraint and permits designs of ultra-high density probes.

Here we report the design and in-vivo validation of such a device, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scanning probe with 1344 electrodes; the outcome of the European research project NeuroSeeker. We show that this design targets both local and global spatial scales by allowing the simultaneous recording of more than 1000 neurons spanning 7 functional regions with a single shaft. The neurons show similar recording longevity and signal to noise ratio to passive probes of comparable size and no adverse effects in awake or anesthetized animals. Addressing the data management of this device we also present novel visualization and monitoring methods. Using the probe with freely moving animals we show how accessing a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions offers a novel perspective on how the brain operates around salient behavioural events. Finally, we compare this probe with lower density, non CMOS designs (which have to adhere to the one electrode per output line rule). We show that an increase in density results in capturing neural firing patterns, undetectable by lower density devices, which correlate to self-similar structures inherent in complex naturalistic behaviour.

To help design electrode configurations for future, even higher density, CMOS probes, recordings from many different brain regions were obtained with an ultra-dense passive probe.","NA"

Morcom","University of Edinburgh","2018-03-21",3,"4","new results","neuroscience","Elevated prefrontal cortex activity is often observed in healthy older adults despite declines in their memory and other cognitive functions. According to one view, this activity reflects a compensatory functional posterior-to-anterior shift, which contributes to maintenance of cognitive performance when posterior cortical function is impaired. Alternatively, the increased prefrontal activity may be less efficient or less specific, owing to structural and neurochemical changes accompanying aging. These accounts are difficult to distinguish on the basis of average activity levels within brain regions. Instead, we used a novel model-based multivariate analysis technique, applied to two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets from an adult-lifespan human sample (N=123 and N=115; approximately half female). Standard analysis replicated the age-related increase in average prefrontal activation, but multivariate tests revealed that this activity did not carry additional information. The results contradict the hypothesis of a compensatory posterior-to-anterior shift. Instead, they suggest that the increased prefrontal activation reflects reduced efficiency or specificity, rather than compensation.\n\nSignificance statementFunctional brain imaging studies have often shown increased activity in prefrontal brain regions in older adults. This has been proposed to reflect a compensatory shift to greater reliance on prefrontal cortex, helping to maintain cognitive function. Alternatively, activity may become less specific as people age. This is a key question in the neuroscience of aging. In this study, we used novel tests of how different brain regions contribute to long- and short-term memory. We found increased activity in prefrontal cortex in older adults, but this activity carried less information about memory outcomes than activity in visual regions. These findings are relevant for understanding why cognitive abilities decline with age, suggesting that optimal function depends on successful brain maintenance rather than compensation.","10.1523/jneurosci.1701-17.2018"

Recently, it was shown that Gleevec selectivity for the Tyr-kinases Abl was instead rooted in conformational changes after drug binding. Here, we investigate whether protein dynamics after binding is a more general paradigm for drug selectivity by characterizing the binding of several approved drugs to the Ser/Thr-kinase Aurora A. Using a combination of biophysical techniques, we propose a universal drug-binding mechanism, that rationalizes selectivity, affinity and long on-target residence time for kinase inhibitors. These new concepts, where protein dynamics in the drug-bound state plays the crucial role, can be applied to inhibitor design of targets outside the kinome.\n\neLife digestThe Ser/Thr kinase Aurora A is an important target for the development of new anticancer therapies. A longstanding question is how to specifically and effectively inhibit only this kinase in a background of over 550 protein kinases with very similar structures.

Here, we characterize the kinetic mechanism of three distinct kinase drugs, Gleevec (Imatinib), Danusertib (PHA739358) and AT9283 (Pyrazol-4-yl Urea) for Aurora A. We show that inhibitor affinities do not rely exclusively on the recognition of a specific conformation of the Asp-Phe-Gly loop of the kinase. Our quantitative kinetics data put forward an opposing mechanism in which a slow conformational change after drug binding (i.e., induced-fit step) dictates drug affinity.","10.7554/elife.36656"

DNA approaches to this kind of species discovery have included both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing and multilocus genomic methods. While these marker types have often been pitted against one another, there are benefits to deploying them together, as linked mtDNA data can provide the bridge between uncovering lineages through rigorous multilocus genomic analysis and identifying lineages through comparison to existing mtDNA databases. Here, we apply one class of multilocus genomic marker, ultraconserved elements (UCEs), and linked mtDNA data to a species complex of frogs (Sarcohyla bistincta) found in the Mexican Highlands. We generated data from 1,891 UCEs, which contained 1,742 informative SNPs for S. bistincta and closely related species and captured mitochondrial genomes for most samples. Genetic analyses based on both whole loci and SNPs agree there are numerous distinct and divergent lineages within S. bistincta. The SNP-based species tree provides the most conservative estimate of 8 well-supported lineages in three major clades. Having linked mtDNA data allowed us to tap into the large number of mtDNA sequences available on GenBank and identify one of these lineages as an already-described species, S. pentheter. One identified clade (containing 2 of the 8 lineages) was 10% divergent in mtDNA and paraphyletic with other S. bistincta, making this clade a clear candidate for species status. Phylogenies from UCEs and mtDNA mostly agreed in their topologies, but differed in that mtDNA suggested a more complex evolutionary history perhaps influenced by gene flow between some neighboring lineages. Our study demonstrates that the Mexican Highlands still hold substantial undescribed diversity. Combining multilocus genomic data with linked mtDNA data is a useful approach for identifying potential new species and associating them with already described taxa, which is especially important in groups with undescribed subadult phenotypes, where geographic ranges are unclear, or where phenotypes are conserved.","NA"

Here, we explored mechanisms of hyperexcitability in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from Dup15q patients. Maturation of resting membrane potential in Dup15q-derived neurons was similar to neurons from unaffected control subjects, but Dup15q neurons had delayed action potential maturation and increased synaptic event frequency and amplitude. Dup15q neurons also showed impairments in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling. Finally, Dup15q neurons showed an increased frequency of spontaneous action potential firing compared to control neurons, in part due to disruption of KCNQ2 channels. Together these data point to multiple mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability that may provide new targets for the treatment of seizures and other phenotypes associated with Dup15q.","NA"

Using genomically diverged island populations of the homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow, we test predictions for phenotypic trait values and evolvability based on patterns of parental species divergence in four plumage color traits. We find associations between parental divergence and trait evolution in Italian sparrows. Fixed major QTL in species differences lead to hybrids with higher trait variation, and hence evolvability, than the parent species. Back and crown plumage show no correlation between current within-parent variability and among-parent differentiation. For these traits, Italian sparrow phenotypes are biased towards axes of high parental differentiation and show greater phenotypic novelty along axes of low current parental evolvability, as predicted when major QTL are involved in species differences. Crown color has consistently evolved back towards one parent, while back color varies among islands. We also find significant among-population diversification within the Italian sparrow. Hence, hybridization of the same parent species can generate different phenotypes. In conclusion, we find support for parental phenotypic divergence patterns reflecting divergence mechanisms, and hence such patterns can be useful in predicting how hybridization alters the potential to evolve and adapt.","NA"

We find that methylation primarily occurs in a CG dinucleotide (CpG) context and that exons are highly enriched for methylated CpGs, particularly at the 3 end of genes. Methylation is positively associated with gene expression, and methylated genes are more stably expressed than un-methylated genes. Male and asexual female morphs have distinct methylation profiles. Strikingly, these profiles are divergent between the sex chromosome and the autosomes; autosomal genes are hypo-methylated in males compared to asexual females, whereas genes belonging to the sex chromosome, which is haploid in males, are hyper-methylated. Overall, we find correlated changes in methylation and gene expression between males and asexual females, and this correlation is particularly strong for genes located on the sex chromosome.

Significantly, a chromosomal inversion results in antigenic variation of PhtD, an important surface-exposed virulence factor.

In this study, we map the transcriptional landscape of the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae by applying a combination of high-throughput RNA-sequencing techniques. Our study reveals a complex transcriptome wherein environment-respondent alternate transcriptional units are observed within operons stemming from internal transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription terminators (TTS) suggesting that more fine-tuning of regulation occurs than previously thought. Additionally, we identify many putative cis-regulatory RNA elements and riboswitches within 5-untranslated regions (5-UTR) of genes. By integrating TSSs and TTSs with independently collected RNA-Seq datasets from a variety of conditions, we establish the response of these regulators to changes in growth conditions and validate several of them. Furthermore, to determine the importance of ribo-regulation by 5-UTR elements for in vivo virulence, we show that the pyrR regulatory element is essential for survival, successful colonization and infection in mice suggesting that such RNA elements are potential drug targets. Importantly, we show that our approach of combining high-throughput sequencing with in vivo experiments can reconstruct a global understanding of regulation, but also pave the way for discovery of compounds that target (ribo-) regulators to mitigate virulence and antibiotic resistance.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007461"

Ever since, several new endogenous small RNA pathways have been described and characterized to different degrees. Much like plants, but unlike Drosophila and mammals, worms have RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases (RdRPs) that directly synthesize small RNAs using other transcripts as a template. The very prominent secondary small interfering RNAs, also called 22G-RNAs, produced by the RdRPs RRF-1 and EGO-1 in C. elegans, maintain the 5 triphosphate group, stemming from RdRP activity, also after loading into an Argonaute protein. This creates a technical issue, since 5PPP groups decrease cloning efficiency for small RNA sequencing. To increase cloning efficiency of these small RNA species, a common practice in the field is the treatment of RNA samples, prior to library preparation, with Tobacco Acid pyrophosphatase (TAP). Recently, TAP production and supply was discontinued, so an alternative must be devised. We turned to RNA 5 pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH), a commercially available pyrophosphatase isolated from E. coli. Here we directly compare TAP and RppH in their use for small RNA library preparation. We show that RppH-treated samples faithfully recapitulate TAP-treated samples. Specifically, there is enrichment for 22G-RNAs and mapped small RNA reads show no small RNA transcriptome-wide differences between RppH and TAP treatment. We propose that RppH can be used as a small RNA pyrophosphatase to enrich for triphosphorylated small RNA species and show that RppH- and TAP-derived datasets can be used in direct comparison.","10.1016/j.mex.2019.01.009"

We dissected neuronal substrates underlying the identified habituation deficits and integrated genotype-phenotype annotations, gene ontologies and interaction networks to determine the clinical features and molecular processes that are associated with habituation deficits.\n\nResultsWe identified more than 100 genes required for habituation learning. For the vast majority of these, 93 genes, a role in habituation learning was previously unknown. These genes characterize ID disorders with overgrowth/macrocephaly and comorbid ASD. Moreover, ASD individuals from the Simons Simplex Collection carrying disruptive de novo mutations in these genes exhibit increased rates of specific aberrant behaviors including stereotypic speech, hyperactivity and irritability. At the molecular level, ID genes required for normal habituation are enriched in synaptic function and converge on Ras-MAPK signaling. Both increased Ras-MAPK signaling in GABAergic and decreased Ras-MAPK signaling in cholinergic neurons specifically inhibit the adaptive habituation response.\n\nConclusionsOur work demonstrates the relevance of habituation learning to autism, identifies an unprecedented number of novel habituation players, supports an emerging role for inhibitory neurons in habituation and reveals an opposing, circuit-level-based mechanism for Ras-MAPK signaling.

The ensuing interdependencies form complex networks, believed to influence taxonomic composition, as well as community-level functional properties and dynamics. Elucidation of these networks is often pursued by measuring pairwise interaction in co-culture experiments. However, combinatorial complexity precludes the exhaustive experimental analysis of pairwise interactions even for moderately sized microbial communities. Here, we use a machine-learning random forest approach to address this challenge. In particular, we show how partial knowledge of a microbial interaction network, combined with trait-level representations of individual microbial species, can provide accurate inference of missing edges in the network and putative mechanisms underlying interactions. We applied our algorithm to two case studies: an experimentally mapped network of interactions between auxotrophic E. coli strains, and a large in silico network of metabolic interdependencies between 100 human gut-associated bacteria. For this last case, 5% of the network is enough to predict the remaining 95% with 80% accuracy, and mechanistic hypotheses produced by the algorithm accurately reflect known metabolic exchanges. Our approach, broadly applicable to any microbial or other ecological network, can drive the discovery of new interactions and new molecular mechanisms, both for therapeutic interventions involving natural communities and for the rational design of synthetic consortia.\n\nImportanceDifferent organisms in a microbial community may drastically affect each others growth phenotype, significantly affecting the community dynamics, with important implications for human and environmental health. Novel culturing methods and decreasing costs of sequencing will gradually enable high-throughput measurements of pairwise interactions in systematic co-culturing studies. However, a thorough characterization of all interactions that occur within a microbial community is greatly limited both by the combinatorial complexity of possible assortments, and by the limited biological insight that interaction measurements typically provide without laborious specific follow-ups. Here we show how a simple and flexible formal representation of microbial pairs can be used for classification of interactions with machine learning. The approach we propose predicts with high accuracy the outcome of yet to be performed experiments, and generates testable hypotheses about the mechanisms of specific interactions.","10.1128/msystems.00181-18"

Unfortunately, excessive CSPGs paradoxically prohibit neuronal recovery and growth, and eventually constitute a scar tissue. Many studies have attempted to overcome this barrier through various molecular approaches including the removal of inhibitory CSPGs by applying chondroitinase enzymes. In this study, we examined whether click-xylosides, which serve as primers of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis, can compete with endogenous inhibitory CSPGs for GAG assembly by serving as decoy molecules and thereby potentially reverse reactive astrocyte mediated neuronal growth inhibition. We investigated the axonal growth of hippocampal neurons in the presence of xyloside treated and untreated reactive astrocyte-conditioned media as a model recapitulating brain injury. Click-xylosides were found to interfere with the GAG biosynthetic machinery in astrocytes and reduced the amount of secreted inhibitory CSPGs by competing with endogenous assembly sites. The extent of underglycosylation was directly related to the outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. Overall, this study suggests that click-xylosides are promising therapeutic agents to treat CNS injuries and warrants further in vivo investigations.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=138 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/286450v1_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@185db74org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10abd40org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eecadorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d48112_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","NA"

Aversive conditioning is a type of associative learning produced by continuous pairing of neutral and aversive stimuli. Aversive conditioning and electroencephalography together provide a good framework for expanding our knowledge about fast learning-related cortical changes. In our experiment we tested a novel paradigm to study associative learning where aversive conditioning was combined with passive oddball. We employed conditioned auditory neutral stimuli and unconditioned aversive electrical shocks and used time-frequency, connectivity and event-related potentials (ERP) analyses to explore their interaction. First, we observed changes in the cortical activity in the form of conditioning-induced multisensory integration. The integration manifested itself in (1) desynchronization of lower beta activity in the contralateral to expected electrical shocks hemisphere and (2) enhanced functional connectivity between auditory and somatosensory cortex in the gamma frequency band. Second, we found a larger amplitude of P3a and the late posterior positivity (LPP) components of ERP to conditioned stimuli, which may be related to increased attentional and emotional significance of these stimuli.

One such signal is the phosphoserine acidic cluster (PSAC), the prototype of which is in the endoprotease Furin. How PSACs are recognized by clathrin adaptors has been controversial. We reported previously that HIV-1 Vpu, which modulates cellular immunoreceptors, contains a PSAC that binds to the {micro} subunits of clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes. Here, we show that the CD of Furin binds the {micro} subunits of AP-1 and AP-2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Moreover, we identify a PSAC in a cytoplasmic loop of the cellular transmembrane Serinc3, an inhibitor of the infectivity of retroviruses. The two serines within the PSAC of Serinc3 are phosphorylated by casein kinase II and mediate interaction with the {micro} subunits in vitro. The sites of these serines vary among mammals in a manner consistent with host-pathogen conflict, yet the Serinc3-PSAC seems dispensible for anti-HIV activity and for counteraction by HIV-1 Nef. The CDs of Vpu, Furin, and the PSAC-containing loop of Serinc3 each bind the  subunit of AP-2 ({micro}2) with similar affinities, but they appear to utilize different basic regions on {micro}2. The Serinc3 loop requires a region previously reported to bind the acidic plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. These data suggest that the PSACs within different proteins recognize different basic regions on the {micro} surface, providing the potential to inhibit the activity of viral proteins without necessarily affecting cellular protein trafficking.","10.1074/jbc.RA118.003080"

A key issue affecting the accuracy and transferrability of these force fields is the use of atom typing. Traditional approaches to defining molecular mechanics force fields must encode, within a discrete set of atom types, all information which will ever be needed about the chemical environment; parameters are then assigned by looking up combinations of these atom types in tables. This atom typing approach leads to a wide variety of problems such as inextensible atom-typing machinery, enormous difficulty in expanding parameters encoded by atom types, and unnecessarily proliferation of encoded parameters. Here, we describe a new approach to assigning parameters for molecular mechanics force fields based on the industry standard SMARTS chemical perception language (with extensions to identify specific atoms available in SMIRKS). In this approach, each force field term (bonds, angles, and torsions, and nonbonded interactions) features separate definitions assigned in a hierarchical manner without using atom types. We accomplish this using direct chemical perception, where parameters are assigned directly based on substructure queries operating on the molecule(s) being parameterized, thereby avoiding the intermediate step of assigning atom types -- a step which can be considered indirect chemical perception. Direct chemical perception allows for substantial simplification of force fields, as well as additional generality in the substructure queries. This approach is applicable to a wide variety of (bio)molecular systems, and can greatly reduce the number of parameters needed to create a complete force field. Further flexibility can also be gained by allowing force field terms to be interpolated based on the assignment of fractional bond orders via the same procedure used to assign partial charges. As an example of the utility of this approach, we provide a minimalist small molecule force field derived from Mercks parm@Frosst (an Amber parm99 descendant), in which a parameter definition file only {approx} 300 lines long can parameterize a large and diverse spectrum of pharmaceutically relevant small molecule chemical space. We benchmark this minimalist force field on the FreeSolv small molecule hydration free energy set and calculations of densities and dielectric constants from the ThermoML Archive, demonstrating that it achieves comparable accuracy to the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF) that consists of many thousands of parameters.","NA"

We used here a translational and transdisciplinary approach to explore the influence of peer presence and peer familiarity in rats and humans that self-administer stimulants. In rats, cocaine intake was compared when rats were alone with intake when peers with different characteristics (familiar or not, cocaine naive or not, dominant or subordinate) were present. In humans, 77 cocaine and/or methylphenidate users were asked to detail their most recent drug use episodes and their relationship with peers present at consumption. The results show that in both humans and rats, the risk of cocaine/stimulant consumption was significantly reduced by 37% and 32%, respectively, when a peer was present. Moreover, the lowest risk of consumption was consistently observed when the peer was unfamiliar (vs familiar) with a further 38% and 17% risk reduction, respectively. In rats, a decreased risk of consumption was greater when the peer was cocaine naive (vs non-cocaine naive).\n\nThe presence of a non-familiar and possibly drug-naive peer is the most efficient condition to diminish stimulant intake. Our results indirectly support the use of harm reduction strategies, in particular supervised consumption rooms for stimulant users.","NA"

Recent studies suggest a strong relationship between resting and task FC. Furthermore, the relationship between resting and task FC has been shown to reflect individual differences. Particularly, various studies have demonstrated that the FC has higher reliability and provides enhanced detection of individual differences while viewing natural scenes. Although the large-scale organization of FC during rest and movie-viewing conditions have been well studied in relation to individual variations, the re-organization of FC during viewing natural scenes have not been studied in depth. In this study, we used principal component analysis on FC during rest and movie-viewing condition to characterize the dimensionality of FC patterns across conditions and subjects. We found that the variations in FC patterns related to viewing natural scenes can be explained by a single component, which enables identification of the task over subjects with 100% accuracy. We showed that the FC mode associated to viewing natural scenes better reflects individual variations. Furthermore, we investigated the signatures of movie-viewing-specific functional modes in dynamic FC based on phase-locking values between brain regions. We found that the movie-specific functional mode is persistent across time; suggesting the emergence of a stable processing mode. To explain the reorganization of whole-brain FC through the changes in local dynamics, we appeal to a large-scale computational model. This modelling suggested that the reorganization of whole-brain FC is associated to the interaction between frontal-parietal and frontal-temporal activation patterns.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.042"

In the present study, we show a new motility mode, in which the ghost model prepared with a high concentration of detergent exhibits directed rotational motions with a constant speed. With a rotational speed and viscous friction of a single ghost, the torque was estimated to be [~]30 pN nm at saturated [ATP]s. Although the origin of the rotation has not been conclusively settled, we found that rotary ghosts treated with sialyllactose, the binding target for leg proteins, were stopped. This result suggested that biomolecules embedded on the cell membrane nonspecifically attaches to the glass and works as a flexible pivot point, and the linear motion of the leg is a driving force for a rotary motion. This simple geometry exemplifies the new mechanism, by which the movement of a linear motor is efficiently converted to a constant rotation of the object on a micrometer scale.","10.1038/s41598-018-29875-9"

Only a small fraction of early drug programs progress to the market, due to safety and efficacy failures, despite extensive efforts to predict drug and target safety as early as possible using a variety of assays in vitro and in preclinical species. In principle, characterizing the effect of natural variation in the genes encoding drug targets should present a powerful alternate approach to predict not only whether a protein will be an effective drug target, but also whether a protein will be an inherently safe drug target, while avoiding the challenges of translating biology from experiments in non-human species. We have embarked on a retrospective analysis, demonstrating for the first time a statistical link between the organ systems involved in genetic syndromes of drug target genes and the organ systems in which side effects are observed clinically. Across 1,819 drugs and 21 organ system phenotype categories analyzed, drug side effects are more likely to occur in organ systems where there is genetic evidence of a link between the drug target and a phenotype involving that organ system, compared to when there is no such genetic evidence (30.0% vs 19.2%; OR = 1.80). Conversely, we find that having genetic evidence of a Mendelian syndrome involving a drug target in which a certain organ system is unaffected decreases the likelihood that side effects will manifest in that organ system, relative to having no informative syndrome (18.5% vs 20.2%; OR = 0.89). We find a relationship between genetics and side effects even when controlling for known confounders such as drug delivery route and indication. We highlight examples where genetics of drug targets could have anticipated side effects observed during clinical trials. This result suggests that human genetic data should be routinely used to predict potential safety issues associated with novel drug targets. This may lead to selection of better targets, appropriate monitoring of putative side effects early in development, reduction of the use of preclinical animal experiments, and ultimately increased success of molecules. Furthermore, deeply phenotyping human knockouts will be critically important to understand the full spectrum of effects that a new drug may elicit.","10.1038/s41467-019-09407-3"

While telephone-based interventions targeting weight loss are used routinely in the general populations, the cost-effectiveness of referring patients with knee osteoarthritis to these is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of referral to a telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service for patients with knee osteoarthritis, who are overweight or obese, compared to usual care.

MethodsWe randomised 120 patients with knee osteoarthritis to an intervention or usual care control group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the intervention group received a referral to an existing non-disease specific 6-month telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service. The primary outcome of the study was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, disability, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Costs included intervention costs, healthcare utilisation costs (healthcare services and medication use) and absenteeism costs due to knee pain. The primary cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal perspective.

ResultsMean cost differences between groups (intervention minus control) were, $454 (95%CI: -2735 to 4206) for healthcare costs, $-36, (95%CI: -73 to 2) for medication costs, and $-13 (95%CI: -225 to 235) for absenteeism costs. The total mean difference in societal costs was $1022 (95%CI: -2201 to 4771). For all outcomes, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective compared with usual care was less than 0.33 at all willingness-to-pay values.

ConclusionFrom a societal perspective, telephone-based weight loss support, provided using an existing non-disease specific 6-month weight management and healthy lifestyle service was not cost-effective in comparison with usual care for overweight and obese patients with knee osteoarthritis for QALYs, pain intensity, disability, weight, and BMI.","NA"

More than 95% of FSHD cases are associated with copy number loss of a 3.3kb tandem repeat (D4Z4 repeat) at the subtelomeric chromosomal region 4q35, of which the pathogenic allele contains less than 10 repeats and has a specific genomic configuration called 4qA. Currently, genetic diagnosis of FSHD requires pulsed-field gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blot, which is labor-intensive, semi-quantitative and requires long turnaround time. Here, we developed a novel approach for genetic diagnosis of FSHD, by leveraging Bionano Saphyr single-molecule optical mapping platform. Using a bioinformatics pipeline developed for this assay, we found that the method gives direct quantitative measurement of repeat numbers, can differentiate 4q35 and the highly paralogous 10q26 regions, can determine the 4qA/4qB allelic configuration, and can quantitate levels of post-zygotic mosaicism. We evaluated this approach on 5 patients (including two with post-zygotic mosaicism) and 2 patients (including one with post-zygotic mosaicism) from two separate cohorts, and had complete concordance with Southern blots, but with improved quantification of repeat numbers resolved between haplotypes. We concluded that single-molecule optical mapping is a viable approach for molecular diagnosis of FSHD and may be applied in clinical diagnostic settings once more validations are performed.","NA"

First, we manually rated quality of N = 784 FreeSurfer-processed T1-weighted scans. Different supervised-learning models were then compared to predict manual quality ratings. Results show that the Qoala-T tool using random forests is able to predict scan quality with both high sensitivity and specificity (mean area under the curve (AUC) = 0.98).

Both enzymes compete for the same substrate but give rise to different products. While the final product of the AOS branch is JA, those of the HPL branch comprise volatile aldehydes and alcohols. AOS and HPL are plastid envelope enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana but accumulate at different locations.

Spindle orientation and positioning is therefore critical to ensure symmetric division in mitosis and asymmetric division during development. The control of astral microtubule length plays an essential role in positioning the spindle. Here we show using gene knockout that the Kinesin-8 Kif18b controls microtubule length to center the mitotic spindle at metaphase. Using an integrated approach, we reveal that Kif18b is a highly processive plus end-directed motor that uses a C-terminal non-motor microtubule-binding region to accumulate at growing microtubule plus ends. This region is regulated by phosphorylation to spatially control Kif18b accumulation at plus ends and is essential for Kif18b-dependent spindle positioning and regulation of microtubule length. Finally, we demonstrate that Kif18b shortens microtubules by increasing the catastrophe rate of dynamic microtubules. Overall, our work reveals that Kif18b utilizes its motile properties to reach microtubule ends where it regulates astral microtubule length to ensure spindle centering.","10.1083/jcb.201705209"

The root of a binary coalescent trees defines two clusters of chromosomes. At two different loci this assignment may be different as a result of recombination. We show that the amount of shared chromosomes among clusters at two different loci, measured by the squared correlation, constitutes a natural measure of LD. We call this topological LD (tLD) since it is induced by the topology of the coalescent tree. We find that its rate of decay decreases more slowly with distance between loci than that of conventional LD. Furthermore, tLD has a smaller coefficient of variation, which should render it more accurate for any kind of mapping purposes than conventional LD.

Noise introduced at initial encoding and during maintenance degrades the precision of representation. Stimulus estimation is also biased away from recently encountered stimuli, a phenomenon known as adaptation. Within a Bayesian framework, greater biases are predicted to result from poor precision. We tested for this effect in individual difference measures. 202 subjects contributed data through an on-line experiment (https://cfn.upenn.edu/iadapt). During separate face and color blocks, subjects performed three different tasks: an immediate stimulus-match (15 trials), a 5 seconds delayed match (30 trials), and 5 seconds of adaptation followed by a delayed match (30 trials). The stimulus spaces were circular and subjects entered their responses using a color/face wheel. Bias and precision of responses were extracted by fitting a mixture of von Mises distributions to account for random guesses. Two blocks of each measure were obtained, allowing for tests of measure reliability. We found that reliable differences between individuals in precision were as great as those between tasks or materials. The adaptation manipulation induced the expected bias in responses (colors: 7.8{degrees}; faces: 5.0{degrees}), and the magnitude of this bias reliably and substantially varied between subjects. Across subjects, there was a negative correlation between mean precision and bias (color:{rho} = -0.26; faces:{rho} = -0.13). This relationship was replicated in a new experiment with 192 subjects (color:{rho} = -0.22; faces:{rho} = -0.19). This result is consistent with a Bayesian observer model, in which individual differences in the precision of perceptual representation influences the magnitude of adaptation bias.","10.1167/18.13.18"

Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data.\n\nOverall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohns disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (prs102275=1.44e-20, prs968567=2.54e-14).

Using transcriptome as a proxy for functional state, we preselected 414 expression profiles of clinically and neuropathologically confirmed AD subjects and age matched non-demented controls sampled from a large community based neuropathological study. By combining brain tissue specific protein interactome with gene network, we identify functionally distinct composite clusters of genes which reveal extensive changes in expression levels in AD. The average global expression for clusters corresponding to synaptic transmission, metabolism, cell cycle, survival and immune response were downregulated while the upregulated cluster had a large set of uncharacterized pathways and processes that may constitute an AD specific phenotypic signature. We identified four master regulators across all clusters of differentially expressed genes by enrichment analysis including TGIF1 and EGR3. These transcription factors have previously not been associated with AD and were validated in brain tissue samples from an independent AD cohort. We identify TGIF1, a transcriptional repressor as being neuroprotective in AD by activating co-repressors regulating genes critical for DNA repair, maintaining homeostasis and arresting cell cycle. In addition, we show that loss of EGR3 regulation, mediates synaptic deficits by targeting the synaptic vesicle cycle. Collectively, our results highlight the utility of integrating protein interactions with gene perturbations to generate a comprehensive framework for characterizing the alterations in molecular network as applied to AD.","NA"

The physiological functions of EGY2 in chloroplasts remains poorly understood. To answer the question what is the significance of EGY2 in chloroplast functioning two T-DNA insertion lines devoid of EGY2 protein were obtained and the mutants phenotype and photosystem II parameters were analyzed. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements revealed that the lack of EGY2 protease caused changes in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and minimum fluorescence yield (F0) as well as higher sensitivity of photosystem II (PSII) to photoinhibition. Further immunoblot analysis revealed significant changes in the accumulation levels of the three chloroplast-encoded PSII core apoproteins: PsbA (D1) and PsbD (D2) forming the PSII reaction centre and PsbC - a protein component of CP43, a part of inner PSII antennae. The accumulation level of nuclear-encoded proteins Lhcb1-3 - a components of the major light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) as well as proteins forming minor peripheral antennae complexes, namely Lhcb4 (CP29), Lhcb5 (CP26), and Lhcb6 (CP24) remain, however, unchanged.

The theoretical analysis revealed multiple evolutionary stable network structures that form a gradient from generalism toward specialism with increasing availability of pollination service. In particular, we found that efficient communities evolve only under pollination oversupply, but that pollination shortage selects for inefficient network structures due to a pollination dilemma. These results suggest that availability of pollination services is a key factor structuring pollination networks and offer a new explanation for the geographical differences in pollination faunas that have long been recognized by ecologists. The study bridges the gap between network studies, game theory, and the natural history of pollination, which have hitherto been studied largely independently.","NA"

The second component is the plant NFR5 receptor, putatively required for Nod-factor binding.\n\nWe collected three wild growing legume species together with soil samples adjacent to the roots (soil pool) from one large 25-year fallow: Vicia sativa, Lathyrus pratensis and Trifolium hybridum nodulated by one of the two Rhizobium leguminosarum biovars (viciae and trifolii). For each plant species we prepared three pools for DNA extraction: the plant pool (30 plant indiv.), the nodule pool (90 nodules) and the soil pool (30 samples). NFR5 gene libraries from the plant pool and nodA gene libraries from nodule and soil pools were sequenced by Sanger technology and High-throughput pyrosequencing, respectively. Analysis of the data demonstrated concordance in population diversities of one symbiotic partner (rhizobia) the second partner (legume host), in line with the Evolutionary Moulding hypothesis. This effect was evinced by the following observations for each plant species: (1) significantly increased diversity in the nodule nodA popset (set of gene sequences derived from the nodule population) compared to the soil popset; (2) a monotonic relationship between the diversity in the plant NFR5 gene popset and the nodule rhizobial nodA gene popset; and (3) higher topological similarity of the NFR5 gene tree with the nodA gene tree of the nodule popset, than with the nodA gene tree of the soil popset. Both nonsynonymous diversity and Tajimas D were increased in the nodule popsets compared to the soil popsets, consistent with relaxation of negative selection and/or admixture of balancing selection underlying the Evolutionary Moulding effect.

Common fragile sites (CFSs) are loci hypersensitive to replication stress3 and are hotspots for chromosomal rearrangements in cancers4. CFSs replicate late in S-phase3, are cell-type dependent4-6 and nest within very large genes4, 7-9. The mechanisms responsible for CFS instability are still discussed, notably the relative impact of transcription-replication conflicts7, 8, 10 versus their low density in replication initiation events5, 6. Here we address the relationships between transcription, replication, gene size and instability by manipulating the transcription of three endogenous large genes, two in chicken and one in human cells. Remarkably, moderate transcription destabilises large genes whereas high transcription levels alleviate their instability. Replication dynamics analyses showed that transcription quantitatively shapes the replication program of large genes, setting both their initiation profile and their replication timing as well as regulating internal fork velocity. Noticeably, high transcription levels advance the replication time of large genes from late to mid S-phase, which most likely gives cells more time to complete replication before mitotic entry. Transcription can therefore contribute to maintaining the integrity of some difficult-to-replicate loci, challenging the dominant view that it is exclusively a threat to genome stability.","10.1038/s41594-018-0170-1"

It has been proposed that the transcriptome suffers decay during aging owing to age-associated down-regulation of transcription factors. In this study, we characterized the role of a transcription factor DAF-16, which is a highly conserved lifespan regulator, in the normal aging process of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that DAF-16 translocates into the nucleus in aged wild-type worms and activates the expression of hundreds of genes in response to age-associated cellular stress. Most of the age-dependent DAF-16 targets are different from the canonical DAF-16 targets downstream of insulin signaling, indicating that activation of DAF-16 during aging is not due to reduced insulin signaling from DAF-2. Further analysis showed that it is due to the loss of proteostasis during aging, at least in part. We also found that without daf-16, dramatic gene expression changes occur as early as on adult day 2, indicating that DAF-16 acts to stabilize the transcriptome during normal aging. Our results thus reveal that normal aging is not simply a process in which the gene expression program descends into chaos due to loss of regulatory activities; rather, there is active transcriptional regulation that fights aging.","NA"

However, the impact of antimicrobial treatment on colonization dynamics is poorly understood. We used data from a previously-conducted trial of amoxicillin-clavulanate therapy for acute otitis media (AOM) to understand how antimicrobial treatment impacts the acquisition and clearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae lineages with varying susceptibility to penicillin.\n\nMethods and findingsWe measured impacts of antimicrobial treatment on nasopharyngeal carriage of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) and penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSP) lineages at end-of-treatment and 15d, 30d, and 60d after treatment in a previously-conducted randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Analyses were not specified in the original protocol. Among children 6-35 months of age with stringently-defined AOM, 162 were assigned amoxicillin-clavulanate, and 160 were assigned placebo. Children who did not show clinical improvement received open-label antimicrobial rescue treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate irrespective of the randomized treatment assignment, to which both patients and physicians were blinded. The intention-to-treat populations of the intervention and placebo arms thus received care resembling immediate antimicrobial therapy and watchful waiting, respectively. Immediate amoxicillin-clavulanate reduced PSSP carriage prevalence by 88% (95%CI: 76-96%) at end-of-treatment and by 27% (-3-49%) after 60d, but did not measurably alter PNSP carriage prevalence throughout follow-up. By end-of-treatment, 7% of children who carried PSSP at enrollment remained colonized in the amoxicillin-clavulanate arm, compared to 61% of PSSP carriers who received placebo; differences in carriage prevalence persisted at least 60d after treatment among children who carried PSSP at enrollment. Among children not carrying pneumococci at enrollment, amoxicillin-clavulanate reduced PSSP acquisition by >80% over 15d. Among children who carried PNSP at enrollment, no differences in carriage prevalence of S. pneumoniae, PSSP, or PNSP were detected at follow-up visits.\n\nConclusionsIn a setting with low PNSP prevalence, antimicrobial therapy for AOM conferred a selective impact on colonizing S. pneumoniae by accelerating clearance, and delaying acquisition, of penicillin-susceptible lineages. Absolute risk of carrying PNSP was unaffected by treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00299455; Funding: NIH/NIGMS).","10.1093/infdis/jiy343"

First, we validate the ability of known and novel chemoproteomic probes to report on fumarate reactivity in vitro.

We have shown that specific hypoxic conditions disrupt protein homeostasis in C. elegans, leading to protein aggregation and proteotoxicity. Here, we show that nutritional cues regulate this effect of hypoxia on proteostasis. Animals fasted prior to hypoxic exposure develop dramatically fewer protein aggregates compared to their fed counterparts, indicating that the effect of hypoxia is abrogated. Fasting is effective at protecting against hypoxia-induced proteostasis defects in multiple developmental stages, tissues, and in different models of misfolded or aggregation prone proteins. Our data also demonstrate that the effect of fasting is induced and reversed quite rapidly, suggesting that the nutritional environment experienced at the onset of hypoxia dictates at least some aspects of the physiological response to hypoxia. We further demonstrate that the insulin/IGF-like signaling pathway plays a role in mediating the protective effects of fasting in hypoxia. Animals with mutations in daf-2, the C. elegans insulin-like receptor, display wild-type levels of hypoxia-induced protein aggregation upon exposure to hypoxia when fed, but are not protected by fasting. However, we found that DAF-2 acts independently of the FOXO transcription factor, DAF-16, to mediate the protective effects of fasting. These results suggest a non-canonical role for the insulin/IGF-like signaling pathway in coordinating the effects of hypoxia and nutritional state on proteostasis.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhen blood flow to various parts of the body becomes restricted, those tissues suffer from a lack of oxygen, a condition called hypoxia. Hypoxia can cause cellular damage and death, such as is observed as a result of stroke and cardiovascular disease. We have found that in the model organism C. elegans (a roundworm) specific concentrations of hypoxia cause aggregation of polyglutamine proteins - the same kind of proteins that are found in an aggregated state in the neurodegenerative disorder Huntingtons disease. Here, we show that that worms can be protected from hypoxia-induced protein aggregation if they are fasted (removed from their food source) prior to experiencing hypoxia. Furthermore, we show that the insulin receptor is required for this protection. The insulin receptor is responsible for detecting insulin, a hormone that is released after feeding. Worms with a nonfunctional version of the insulin receptor displayed hypoxia-induced protein aggregation despite being fasted before the hypoxic exposure. Our results highlight a new role for the insulin signaling pathway in coordinating the effects of both hypoxia and nutritional state on protein aggregation.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1008242"

Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in [~]450,000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N[~]700,000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3,290 and 716 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of p<1 x 10-8), including 1,185 height-associated SNPs and 554 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The genome-wide significant SNPs explain [~]24.6% of the variance of height and [~]5% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).

Identifying microbial genes influencing fitness in the gut could lead to new ways to engineer probiotics or disrupt pathogenesis. We approach this problem by measuring the statistical association between having a species having a gene and the probability that the species is present in the gut microbiome. The challenge is that closely related species tend to be jointly present or absent in the microbiome and also share many genes, only a subset of which are involved in gut adaptation. We show that this phylogenetic correlation indeed leads to many false discoveries and propose phylogenetic linear regression as a powerful solution. To apply this method across the bacterial tree of life, where most species have not been experimentally phenotyped, we use metagenomes from hundreds of people to quantify each species prevalence in and specificity for the gut microbiome. This analysis reveals thousands of genes potentially involved in adaptation to the gut across species, including many novel candidates as well as processes known to contribute to fitness of gut bacteria, such as acid tolerance in Bacteroidetes and sporulation in Firmicutes. We also find microbial genes associated with a preference for the gut over other body sites, which are significantly enriched for genes linked to fitness in an in vivo competition experiment. Finally, we identify gene families associated with higher prevalence in patients with Crohns disease, including Proteobacterial genes involved in conjugation and fimbria regulation, processes previously linked to inflammation. These gene targets may represent new avenues for modulating host colonization and disease. Our strategy of combining metagenomics with phylogenetic modeling is general and can be used to identify genes associated with adaptation to any environment.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhy do certain microbes and not others colonize our gut, and why do they differ between healthy and sick people? One explanation is the genes in their genomes. If we can find microbial genes involved in gut adaptation, we may be able to keep out pathogens and encourage the growth of beneficial microbes. One could look for genes that were present more often in prevalent microbes, and less often in rare ones.\n\nHowever, this ignores that related species are more likely to share an environment and also share many unrelated phenotypes simply because of common ancestry. To solve this problem, we used a method from ecology that accounts for phylogenetic relatedness. We first calculated gut prevalence for thousands of species using a compendium of shotgun sequencing data, then tested for genes associated with prevalence, adjusting for phylogenetic relationships. We found genes that are associated with overall gut prevalence, with a preference for the gut over other body sites, and with the gut in Crohns disease versus health. Many of these findings have biological plausibility based on existing literature. We also showed agreement with the results of a previously published high-throughput screen of bacterial gene knockouts in mice. These results, and this type of analysis, may eventually lead to new strategies for maintaining gut health.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006242"

Crosstalk signaling between JNK and p38 is emerging as an important regulatory mechanism in the inflammatory and stress responses. However, it is still unknown how this crosstalk affects signaling dynamics, cell-to-cell variation, and cellular responses at the single-cell level. To address these questions, we established a multiplexed live-cell imaging system based on kinase translocation reporters to simultaneously monitor JNK and p38 activities with high specificity and sensitivity at single-cell resolution. Various stresses, such as anisomycin, osmotic stress, and UV irradiation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines activated JNK and p38 with various dynamics. In all cases, however, p38 suppressed JNK activity in a cross-inhibitory manner. We demonstrate that p38 antagonizes JNK through both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. This cross-inhibition of JNK appears to generate cellular heterogeneity in JNK activity after stress exposure.

In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as \""value representations\"", and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. A fundamental unanswered question is whether these different functions are mediated by the same or different neural mechanisms. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that cleanly separates learning from choosing. We address the role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key player in value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that, contrary to prominent theories, the OFC does not directly drive choices. Instead, it supplies value information to a learning process that updates choice mechanisms elsewhere in the brain. This result places important constraints on neural architectures for learning and choosing.","NA"

Significantly, a chromosomal inversion results in antigenic variation of PhtD, an important surface-exposed virulence factor. We generated a new genome annotation using automated tools, followed by manual curation, reflecting the current knowledge in the field. By combining sequence-driven terminator prediction, deep paired-end transcriptome sequencing and enrichment of primary transcripts by Cappable-Seq, we mapped 1,015 transcriptional start sites and 748 termination sites. Using this new genomic map, we identified several new small RNAs (sRNAs), riboswitches (including twelve previously misidentified as sRNAs), and antisense RNAs. In total, we annotated 92 new protein-encoding genes, 39 sRNAs and 165 pseudogenes, bringing the S. pneumoniae D39 repertoire to 2,151 genetic elements.

Here we present a model of Hsp70-mediated protein folding, which predicts that Hsp70, as a result of differential stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by its Hsp40 cochaperone, dissociates faster from a substrate in fold-competent conformations than from one in misfolding-prone conformations, thus elevating the native concentration above and suppressing the misfolded concentration below their respective equilibrium values.

We consider different disease progressions accounting for lethal infection, immunity waning, and potential cross-species transmission when the two populations share the same refuge along the migratory path of M. schreibersii.\n\nResultsWe find that EBLV-1 persistence relies on host spatial structure through the migratory nature of M. schreibersii bats, on cross-species mixing with M. myotis population, and on a disease progression leading to survival of infected animals followed by temporary immunity. The higher fragmentation along the northern portion of the migratory path is necessary to maintain EBLV-1 sustained circulation in both species, whereas persistence would not be ensured in the single colony of M. myotis. Our study provides first estimates for the EBLV-1 transmission potential in M. schreibersii bats and average duration of immunity in the host species, yielding values compatible with previous empirical observations in M. myotis bats.\n\nConclusionsHabitats sharing and the strong spatial component of EBLV-1 transmission dynamics identified as key drivers in this ecological context may help understanding the observed spatial diffusion of the virus at a larger scale and across a diverse range of host species, through long-range migration and seeding of local populations.

We compared standard machine learning methods (elastic net, ridge regression, lasso regression, random forest, gradient boosting machines (GBM), and support vector machines (SVM)), with two state-of-the-art classical statistical genetics methods (including genomic BLUP). Additionally, using the clean yeast data, we investigated how performance varied with the complexity of the biological mechanism, the amount of observational noise, the number of examples, the amount of missing data, and the use of different data representations. We found that for almost all phenotypes considered standard machine learning methods outperformed the methods from classical statistical genetics. On the yeast problem, the most successful method was GBM, followed by lasso regression, and the two statistical genetics methods; with greater mechanistic complexity GBM was best, while in simpler cases lasso was superior. When applied to the wheat and rice studies the best two methods were SVM and BLUP. The most robust method in the presence of noise, missing data, etc. was random forests. The classical statistical genetics method of genomic BLUP was found to perform well on problems where there was population structure, which suggests one way to improve standard machine learning methods when population structure is present.

We found and optimized in vitro conditions that produce titan cells in order to identify the ancestry of titan cells, the environmental determinants, and the key gene regulators of titan cell formation. Titan cells generated in vitro harbor the main characteristics of titan cells produced in vivo including their large cell size (>10 {micro}m), polyploidy with a single nucleus, large vacuole, dense capsule, and thick cell wall. Here we show titan cells derived from the enlargement of progenitor cells in the population independent of yeast growth rate. Change in the incubation medium, hypoxia, nutrient starvation and low pH were the main factors that trigger titan cell formation, while quorum sensing factors like the initial inoculum concentration, pantothenic acid, and the quorum sensing peptide Qsp1p also impacted titan cell formation. Inhibition of ergosterol, protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis altered titan cell formation, as did serum, phospholipids and anti-capsular antibodies in our settings. We explored genetic factors important for titan cell formation using three approaches. Using H99-derivative strains with natural genetic differences, we showed that titan cell formation was dependent on LMP1 and SGF29 genes. By screening a gene deletion collection, we also confirmed that GPR4/5-RIM101, and CAC1 genes were required to generate titan cells and that the PKR1, TSP2, USV101 genes negatively regulated titan cell formation. Furthermore, analysis of spontaneous Pkr1 loss-of-function clinical isolates confirmed the important role of the Pkr1 protein as a negative regulator of titan cell formation.

Particularly, in the lungs of infected mice, a subpopulation of yeast enlarges, producing cells up to 100 {micro}m in cell body diameter - referred to as titan cells. Along with their large size, the titan cells have other unique characteristics such as thickened cell wall, dense capsule, polyploidization, large vacuole with peripheral nucleus and cellular organelles. The generation of a large number of such cells outside the lungs of mice has been described but was not reproducible nor standardized. Here we report standardized, reproducible, robust conditions for generation of titan cells and explored the environmental and genetic factors underlying the genesis of these cells. We showed that titan cells were generated upon stresses such as change in the incubation medium, nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and low pH. Using collections of well characterized reference strains and clinical isolates, we validated with our model that the cAMP/PKA/Rim101 pathway is a major genetic determinant of titan cell formation. This study opens the way for a more comprehensive picture of the ontology of morphological changes in Cryptococcus neoformans and its impact on pathobiology of this deadly pathogen.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1006982"

Exosomes can be a vital source of biomarkers as they contain various substances (e.g. lipids, RNAs, metabolites and proteins) that can reflect the cell of origin (e.g. cancer cells). For isolation of exosomes present in biological matrices, ultracentrifugation (UC)-based procedures are most common. Other approaches exist, including commercial kits developed for easy and low sample volume isolation. In this study, differential UC and an isolation kit from a major vendor (Total Exosome Isolation Reagent from Thermo Fisher Scientific) were compared. Exosomes were isolated from cell culture media of two different cell sources (patient derived cells from glioblastoma multiforme and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231). For both isolation methods, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and western blotting indicated the presence of exosomes. The kit- and UC isolates contained similar amounts of protein measured by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay with absorbance at 562 nm. Using western blot, positive exosome markers were identified in all isolates, and additional exosome markers were identified using MS-based proteomics. For the glioblastoma exosome isolates, the number of proteins identified with liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) was higher for the UC isolates than the kit isolates when injecting equal protein amounts, contrary to that for the breast cancer exosome isolates. However, negative exosome markers were also found in glioblastoma isolates using LC-MS/MS. Thus, we would not use the term \""exosome isolation\"" as impurities may be present with both isolation methods. Notably, potential biomarkers for both diseases were identified in the isolates using LS-MS/MS. In our opinion, the two isolation methods had rather similar performance, although with some minor differences based on cell of origin.","NA"

Some susceptible individuals have higher rates of risky behavior that increase their chance of contracting the disease. Infected individuals can be considered to be generally sexually active or inactive. The sexually active infected population is at higher risk of transmitting the disease to a susceptible individual. We further divide the sexually active population into diagnosed or undiagnosed infected individuals. We define model parameters for both the national and the urban case. These parameter sets are used to study the predicted population dynamics over the next 5 years. Our results indicate that the undiagnosed high risk infected group is the largest contributor to the epidemic. Finally, we apply a preventative medication protocol to the susceptible population and observe the effective reduction in the infected population. The simulations suggest that preventative medication effectiveness extends outside of the group that is taking the drug (herd immunity). Our models suggest that a strategy targeting the high risk undiagnosed infected group would have the largest impact in the next 5 years. We also find that such a protocol has similar effects for the national as the urban case, despite the smaller sexual network found in rural areas.","NA"

On the other hand, in the clinic, drug induced liver injury typically manifests 5 days to 3 months after starting a medication. Thus, novel approaches that can maintain the function of primary human hepatocytes for longer durations of time may enable the development of improved in vitro assays for detecting hepatotoxicity. Previous studies have demonstrated that two-dimensional micro-patterning of hepatocytes with fibroblasts leads to improved maintenance of the hepatocyte phenotype relative to hepatocyte monocultures, in serum containing medium. Additionally, we, and others, have shown that three-dimensional culture of hepatocytes leads to enhanced function (in serum-free medium). In this study we wanted to (i) examine the effect of combining the above two approaches on hepatocyte function, and (ii) to further delineate the effect of serum on hepatocyte function. We developed a user-friendly and inexpensive approach for constructing layered spheroids. Similar to previous results in two-dimensional (2d) culture, we observed that 3d culture of hepatocytes alone (i.e. monoculture) in serum-containing medium led to an increase in the urea production rate, but near-complete loss of cytochrome activity in both lots of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) tested. In serum-free sandwich culture, cytochrome activity was maintained at the level observed in freshly thawed PHH for one lot, but almost completely lost in another lot. Spheroid culture of both lots of PHH in serum-free medium led to maintenance of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 activity at the fresh thaw level, though CYP2B6 activity was reduced. In contrast to PHH monoculture, co-cultures of PHH with NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells benefitted from the presence of serum, and led to 3-5-fold increases in CYP activity relative to even serum-free spheroid monocultures. Layering of the fibroblasts did not result in improvements over mixed co-cultures. These results indicate the importance of appropriate serum-free monoculture control experiments in the evaluation of novel biomaterials and techniques for hepatocyte co-culture. Further, urea production and cytochrome production are decoupled; therefore, urea production is an insufficient readout when developing models for pharmaceutical applications.","NA"

We investigated the mechanoresponse of cyclically-stretched fibroblasts under a spatially non-uniform strain field which was subjected to repeated changes in stretching directions over 55 hours. A polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic stretcher array optimized for complex staining procedures and imaging was developed to generate biologically relevant strain and strain gradient amplitudes. We demonstrated that cells can successfully reorient themselves repeatedly, as the main cyclical stretching direction is consecutively switched between two perpendicular directions every 11 hours. Importantly, from one reorientation to the next, the extent to which cells reorient themselves perpendicularly to the local strain direction progressively decreases, while their tendency to align perpendicularly to the strain gradient direction tends to increase. We demonstrate that these results are consistent with our finding that cellular responses to strains and strain gradients occur on two distinct time scales, the latter being slower. Overall, our results reveal the absence of major irreversible cellular changes that compromise the ability to sense and reorient to changing strain directions under the conditions of this experiment.

A crucial, yet unresolved question in meiosis is how spindle microtubules are generated without centrosomes and only around chromosomes in the large volume of oocytes. Here we report a novel oocyte-specific microtubule nucleation pathway that is essential for assembling most spindle microtubules complementarily with the Augmin pathway, and sufficient for triggering microtubule assembly in oocytes. This pathway is mediated by the kinesin-6 Subito/MKlp2, which recruits the {gamma}-tubulin complex to the spindle equator to nucleate microtubules in Drosophila oocytes. Away from chromosomes, Subito interaction with the {gamma}-tubulin complex is suppressed by its N-terminal region to prevent ectopic microtubule assembly in oocytes. We further demonstrate that the Subito complex from ovaries can nucleate microtubules from pure tubulin dimers in vitro. Taken together, microtubule nucleation regulated by Subito drives spatially restricted spindle assembly in oocytes.","10.1083/jcb.201803172"

A.","Andrew A Forbes","University of Iowa","2018-03-22",3,"15","new results","zoology","BackgroundWe challenge the oft-repeated claim that the beetles (Coleoptera) are the most species-rich order of animals. Instead, we assert that another order of insects, the Hymenoptera, are more speciose, due in large part to the massively diverse but relatively poorly known parasitoid wasps. The idea that the beetles have more species than other orders is primarily based on their respective collection histories and the relative availability of taxonomic resources, which both disfavor parasitoid wasps. Though it is unreasonable to directly compare numbers of described species in each order, the ecology of parasitic wasps - specifically, their intimate interactions with their hosts - allows for estimation of relative richness. We present a simple logical model that shows how the specialization of many parasitic wasps on their hosts suggests few scenarios in which there would be more beetle species than parasitic wasp species. We couple this model with an accounting of what we call the \""genus-specific parasitoid-host ratio\"" from four well-studied genera of insect hosts, a metric by which to generate extremely conservative estimates of the average number of parasitic wasp species attacking a given beetle or other insect host species. Synthesis of our model with data from real host systems suggests that the Hymenoptera may have 2.5 - 3.2x more species than the Coleoptera. While there are more described species of beetles than all other animals, the Hymenoptera are almost certainly the larger order.","10.1186/s12898-018-0176-x"

We found that these macrophages, which bear a gene expression profile consistent with monocytic origin, progressively acquire alveolar macrophage identity and localize to sites of fibroblast accumulation. Probing their functional role, in vitro studies showed a trophic effect of these cells on fibroblast activation, and ablation of Cx3cr1-expressing cells suppressed fibrosis in vivo. We also found by gene set analysis and immunofluorescence that markers of these macrophages were upregulated in samples from patients with lung fibrosis compared with healthy controls.

Here, we analyzed the role of miR-202, a miRNA predominantly expressed in male and female gonads in several vertebrate species. We studied its expression in the medaka ovary and generated a mutant line (using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering) to determine its importance for reproductive success with special interest for egg production. Our results show that miR-202-5p is the biologically active form of the miRNA and that it is expressed in granulosa cells and in the unfertilized egg. The knock out (KO) of miR-202 resulted in a strong phenotype both in terms of number and quality of eggs produced. Mutant females exhibited either no egg production or produced a drastically reduced number of eggs that could not be fertilized, ultimately leading to no reproductive success. We quantified the size distribution of the oocytes in the ovary of KO females and performed a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis approach to identified dysregulated molecular pathways. Together, cellular and molecular analyses indicate that lack of miR-202 impairs the early steps of oogenesis/folliculogenesis and decreases the number of large (i.e. vitellogenic) follicles, ultimately leading to dramatically reduced female fecundity.

In this study we sequenced genomes of representatives from all five major clades recognized within the birds-of-paradise family (Paradisaeidae). Our aim was to characterize genomic changes that may have been important for the evolution of the groups extensive phenotypic diversity.\n\nResultsWe sequenced three de novo genomes and re-sequenced two additional genomes representing all major clades within the birds-of-paradise. We found genes important for coloration, morphology and feather development to be under positive selection. GO enrichment of positively selected genes on the branch leading to the birds-of-paradise shows an enrichment for collagen, glycogen synthesis and regulation, eye development and other categories. In the core birds-of-paradise, we found GO categories for  startle response (response to predators) and  olfactory receptor activity to be enriched among the gene families expanding significantly faster compared to the other birds in our study. Furthermore, we found novel families of retrovirus-like retrotransposons active in all three de novo genomes since the early diversification of the birds-of-paradise group, which could have potentially played a role in the evolution of this fascinating group of birds.\n\nConclusionHere we provide a first glimpse into the genomic changes underlying the evolution of birds-of-paradise.

One unsolved problem is the mechanism of inhibition of processing of DNA double-strand break repair by REV7 and its influence on DNA repair pathways. We searched for REV7-associated proteins in human cells and found FAM35A, a protein of previously unknown function. By analyzing the FAM35A sequence we discovered that FAM35A has an unstructured N-terminal region and a C-terminal region harboring three OB-fold domains similar to single-stranded binding protein RPA. Knockdown of FAM35A caused sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, and FAM35A re-localized in damaged cell nuclei. In a BRCA1 mutant cell line, however, depletion of FAM35A increased resistance to camptothecin, suggesting that FAM35A participates in processing of DNA ends to allow more efficient DNA repair. Moreover, we found FAM35A absent in one widely used BRCA1-mutant cancer cell line (HCC1937) with anomalous resistance to PARP inhibitors. A survey of FAM35A alterations in cancer revealed that the gene is altered at the highest frequency in prostate cancers (up to 13%) and significantly less expressed in metastatic cases.

The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) consists of 37 genes that support oxidative phosphorylation and are prone to dysfunction that can lead to currently untreatable diseases. Further characterization of mtDNA gene function and creation of more accurate models of human disease will require the ability to engineer precise genomic sequence modifications. To date, mtDNA has been inaccessible to direct modification using traditional genome engineering tools due to unique DNA repair contexts in mitochondria1. Here, we report a new DNA modification process using sequence-specific transcription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins to manipulate mtDNA in vivo and in vitro for reverse genetics applications. First, we show mtDNA deletions can be induced in Danio rerio (zebrafish) using site-directed mitoTALE-nickases (mito-nickases). Using this approach, the protein-encoding mtDNA gene nd4 was deleted in injected zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, this DNA engineering system recreated a large deletion spanning from nd5 to atp8, which is commonly found in human diseases like Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) and Pearson syndrome. Enrichment of mtDNA-deleted genomes was achieved using targeted mitoTALE-nucleases (mitoTALENs) by co-delivering both mito-nickases and mitoTALENs into zebrafish embryos. This combined approach yielded deletions in over 90% of injected animals, which were maintained through adulthood in various tissues. Subsequently, we confirmed that large, targeted deletions could be induced with this approach in human cells. In addition, we show that, when provided with a single nick on the mtDNA light strand, the binding of a terminal TALE protein alone at the intended recombination site is sufficient for deletion induction. This \""block and nick\"" approach yielded engineered mitochondrial molecules with single nucleotide precision using two different targeted deletion sites. This precise seeding method to engineer mtDNA variants is a critical step for the exploration of mtDNA function and for creating new cellular and animal models of mitochondrial disease.","NA"

We find that mavacamten stabilizes an auto-inhibited state of two-headed cardiac myosin, not found in the isolated S1 myosin motor fragment. We determined this by measuring cardiac myosin actin-activated and actin-independent ATPase and single ATP turnover kinetics. A two-headed myosin fragment exhibits distinct auto-inhibited ATP turnover kinetics compared to a single-headed fragment. Mavacamten enhanced this auto-inhibition. It also enhanced auto-inhibition of ADP release. Furthermore, actin changes the structure of the auto-inhibited state by forcing myosin lever-arm rotation. Mavacamten slows this rotation in two-headed myosin but does not prevent it. We conclude that cardiac myosin is regulated in solution by an interaction between its two heads and propose that mavacamten stabilizes this state.\n\nSignificance StatementSmall-molecule allosteric effectors designed to target and modulate striated and smooth myosin isoforms for the treatment of disease show promise in preclinical and clinical trials. Beta-cardiac myosin is an especially important target, as heart disease remains a primary cause of death in the U.S. One prevalent type of heart disease is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is hypothesized to result from dysregulated force generation by cardiac myosin. Mavacamten is a potent cardiac myosin ATPase activity inhibitor that improves cardiac output in HCM animal models. Our results show that mavacamten selectively stabilizes a two-head dependent, auto-inhibited state of cardiac myosin in solution. The kinetics and energetics of this state are consistent with the auto-inhibited super-relaxed state, previously only observed in intact sarcomeres.","10.1073/pnas.1720342115"

Here we used live-cell imaging of human cells in culture, combined with RNA-seq and qPCR, to investigate the requirement for de novo transcription during mitosis. Under conditions of persistently unattached kinetochores, transcription inhibition with actinomycin D, or treatment with other DNA-intercalating drugs, delocalized the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) protein Aurora B from centromeres, compromising SAC robustness and cell fate. However, we were unable to detect significant changes in transcript levels. Moreover, inhibition of transcription independently of DNA intercalation had no effect on SAC response, mitotic progression, exit or death. Mechanistically, we show that DNA intercalating agents reduce the interaction of the CPC with nucleosomes. Thus, the capacity of human cells to progress, sustain, exit or die in mitosis relies on centromere integrity, rather than de novo transcription.","10.7554/eLife.36898"

However, the lack of an inexpensive small animal model of enteric disease with Campylobacter has been a major limitation for understanding its pathogenesis, interventions or vaccine development. We describe a robust standard mouse model that can exhibit reproducible bloody diarrhea or growth failure, depending on the zinc or protein deficient diet and on antibiotic alteration of normal microbiota prior to infection. Zinc deficiency and the use of antibiotics create a niche for Campylobacter infection to establish by narrowing the metabolic flexibility of these mice for pathogen clearance and by promoting intestinal and systemic inflammation. Several biomarkers and intestinal pathology in this model also mimic those seen in human disease. This model provides a novel tool to testing specific hypotheses regarding disease pathogenesis as well as vaccine development that is currently in progress.\n\nAuthor SummaryCampylobacter jejuni has been identified as one of the leading causes of enteropathy and diarrhea. In developing countries, these repeated enteric infections often result in growth deficits and cognitive impairment. There is a lack of small animal models of Campylobacter infection. This is a major hurdle in understanding the pathogenesis of Campylobacter infection in order to lead to therapeutic treatments and vaccines. We have developed a highly reproducible mouse model of Campylobacter infection that has clinical outcomes that match those of malnourished children. We hope that these insights into Campylobacter susceptibility will lead to the development of treatments against this major cause of diarrheal illness.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007083"

The cytoprotective activity of Nrf2, though being oppositely involved in both cancer prevention and progression, is critically controlled by Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) as an adaptor subunit of Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, that is a key sensor for oxidative and electrophilic stresses. Now, we first report a novel naturally-occurring mutant of Keap1, designated Keap1{Delta}C, which lacks most of its C-terminal Nrf2-interacting domain essential for inhibition of the CNC-bZIP factor. This mutant Keap1{Delta}C is yielded by translation from an alternatively mRNA-spliced variant lacking the fourth and fifth exons, but their coding sequences are retained in the wild-type Keap1 locus (with no genomic deletions). Although this variant was found primarily in the human highly-metastatic hepatoma (MHCC97H) cells, it was widely expressed at very lower levels in all other cell lines examined. No matter whether Keap1{Delta}C retains less or no ability to inhibit Nrf2, it functions as a dominant-negative competitor of Keap1 against its inhibition of Nrf2-target genes.

We find a generic mode of asexual evolution called phenotypic interference with strong implications for systems biology: it couples the stability and function of individual genes to the populations global speed of evolution. This mode occurs over a wide range of evolutionary parameters appropriate for microbial populations. It generates selection against genome complexity, because the fitness cost of mutations increases faster than linearly with the number of genes. Recombination can generate a distinct mode of sexual evolution that eliminates the superlinear cost. We show that positive selection can drive a transition from asexual to facultative sexual evolution, providing a specific, biophysically grounded scenario for the evolution of sex. In a broader context, our analysis suggests that the systems biology of microbial organisms is strongly intertwined with their mode of evolution.","NA"

Viral quasispecies assembly refers to reconstructing the strain-specific haplotypes from read data, and predicting their relative abundances within the mix of strains, an important step for various treatment-related reasons. Reference-genome-independent (\""de novo\"") approaches have yielded benefits over reference-guided approaches, because reference-induced biases can become overwhelming when dealing with divergent strains. While being very accurate, extant de novo methods only yield rather short contigs. It remains to reconstruct full-length haplotypes together with their abundances from such contigs.\n\nMethodWe first construct a variation graph, a recently popular, suitable structure for arranging and integrating several related genomes, from the short input contigs, without making use of a reference genome. To obtain paths through the variation graph that reflect the original haplotypes, we solve a minimization problem that yields a selection of maximal-length paths that is optimal in terms of being compatible with the read coverages computed for the nodes of the variation graph. We output the resulting selection of maximal length paths as the haplotypes, together with their abundances.\n\nResultsBenchmarking experiments on challenging simulated data sets show significant improvements in assembly contiguity compared to the input contigs, while preserving low error rates. As a consequence, our method outperforms all state-of-the-art viral quasispecies assemblers that aim at the construction of full-length haplotypes, in terms of various relevant assembly measures.

We tested whether, over the course of 11 years, distinct soil bacterial communities developed under plant monocultures and mixtures, and if over this timeframe plants with a monoculture or mixture history changed in the microbial communities they associated with. For eight species, we grew offspring of plants that had been grown for 11 years in the same monocultures or mixtures (monoculture- or mixture-type plants) in pots inoculated with microbes extracted from the monoculture and mixture soils. After five months of growth in the glasshouse, we collected rhizosphere soil from each plant and used 16S-rRNA gene sequencing to determine the community composition and diversity of the bacterial communities. Microbial community structure in the plant rhizosphere was primarily determined by soil legacy (monoculture vs. mixture soil) and by plant species identity, but not by plant legacy (monoculture- vs. mixture-type plants). In seven out of the eight plant species bacterial abundance was larger when inoculated with microbes from mixture soil. We conclude that plant diversity can strongly affect belowground community composition and diversity, feeding back to the assemblage of rhizosphere microbial communities in newly establishing plants. Thereby our work demonstrates that concerns for plant biodiversity loss are also concerns for soil biodiversity loss.","10.1111/mec.14987"

Previous research has shed light on factors that determine egg quality, however, large gaps remain. Initial development of the embryo relies on maternally-inherited molecules, such as transcripts, deposited in the egg, thus, they would likely reflect egg quality. We performed transcriptome analysis on zebrafish fertilized eggs of different quality from unrelated, wildtype couples to obtain a global portrait of the egg transcriptome to determine its association with developmental competence and to identify new candidate maternal-effect genes.\n\nResultsFifteen of the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Gene ontology analysis showed that enriched terms included ribosomes and translation. In addition, statistical modeling using partial least squares regression and genetics algorithm also demonstrated that gene signatures from the transcriptomic data can be used to predict reproductive success. Among the validated DEGs, otulina and slc29a1a were found to be increased in good quality eggs and to be predominantly localized in the ovaries. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mutants of each gene revealed remarkable subfertility whereby the majority of their embryos were unfertilizable. The Wnt pathway appeared to be dysregulated in the otulina knockout-derived eggs.\n\nConclusionsOur novel findings suggested that even in varying quality of eggs due to heterogeneous causes from unrelated wildtype couples, gene signatures exist in the egg transcriptome, which can be used to predict developmental competence.

As cold, nutrient-rich water is brought up to sunlit layers from depth, phytoplankton are also transported upwards to seed surface blooms that are often dominated by diatoms. The physiological response of phytoplankton to this process, commonly referred to as shift-up, is characterized by rapid growth rates and increases in nitrate assimilation. To examine the molecular underpinnings behind this phenomenon, metatranscriptomics was applied to a simulated upwelling experiment using natural phytoplankton communities from the California Upwelling Zone. An increase in diatom growth following five days of incubation was attributed to the genera Chaetoceros and Pseudo-nitzschia. Here we show that certain bloom-forming diatoms exhibit a distinct transcriptional response that coordinates shift-up where diatoms exhibited the greatest transcriptional change following upwelling; however, comparison of coexpressed genes exposed overrepresentation of distinct sets within each of the dominant phytoplankton groups. The analysis revealed that diatoms frontload genes involved in nitrogen assimilation likely in order to outcompete other groups for available nitrogen during upwelling events. We speculate that the evolutionary success of diatoms may be due, in part, to this proactive response to frequently encountered changes in their environment.","10.1111/1462-2920.14361"

While the development of new antibiotics is critical, understanding the mechanisms behind the crescent bacterial pathogenicity is equally relevant. Often, resistance and other bacterial virulence elements are contained on highly mobile pieces of DNA that can easily spread to other bacteria. Prophages are one of the mediators of this form of gene transfer, and have been frequently found in bacterial genomes, often offering advantageous features to the host. Here we question the contribution of prophages for the evolution of A. baumannii pathogenicity. We found prophages to be notably diverse and widely disseminated in A. baumannii genomes. Also remarkably, A. baumannii prophages encode for multiple putative virulence factors that may be implicated in the bacteriums capacity to colonize host niches, evade the host immune system, subsist in unfavorable environments, and tolerate antibiotics. Overall our results point towards a significant contribution of prophages for the dissemination and evolution of pathogenicity in A. baumannii, and highlight their clinical relevance.","10.1038/s41598-018-33800-5"

Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was applied to RNA-quality adjusted DLPFC RNA-Seq data from the LIBD Postmortem Human Brain Repository (90 controls, 74 schizophrenia; Caucasians) to construct co-expression networks and detect modules of co-expressed genes. After internal and external validation, modules of selected interest were tested for enrichment in biological ontologies, association with schizophrenia polygenic risk scores (PRS), with diagnosis and for enrichment in genes within the significant GWAS loci reported by the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium (PGC2). The association between schizophrenia genetic signals and modules of co-expression converged on one module showing a significant association with diagnosis, PRS and significant overlap with 36 PGC2 loci genes, deemed as tier 1 (strongest candidates for drug targets). Fifty-three PGC2 loci genes were in modules associated only with diagnosis (tier 2) and 59 in modules unrelated to diagnosis or PRS (tier 3).

Yet, it is largely unknown whether the intensity of this activity is enough to affect the configuration of biodiversity at broader levels of spatial organization. Zoogeographical regions, or zooregions, are surfaces of the Earth defined by characteristic pools of species, which reflect ecological, historical, and evolutionary processes acting over millions of years. Consequently, it is widely assumed that zooregions are robust and unlikely to change on a human timescale. Here, however, we show that human-mediated introductions and extinctions can indeed reconfigure the currently recognized zooregions of amphibians, mammals, and birds. In particular, introductions homogenize the African and Eurasian zooregions in mammals; reshape boundaries with the reallocation of Oceania to the New World zooregion in amphibians; and divide bird zooregions by increasing biotic heterogeneity. Furthermore, the combined effect of amphibian introductions and extinctions has the potential to divide two zooregions largely representing the Old and the New World. Interestingly, the robustness of zooregions against changes in species composition may largely explain such zoogeographical changes. Altogether, our results demonstrate that human activities can erode the higher-level organization of biodiversity formed over millions of years. Comparable reconfigurations have previously been detectable in Earths history only after glaciations and mass extinction events, highlighting the profound and far-reaching impact of ongoing human activity and the need to protect the uniqueness of biotic assemblages from the effects of future species introductions and extinctions.","10.1111/ele.13321"

Previously we showed transient elevation of the methionine-derived metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA) in serum during systemic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) infection. Here we explored the functional consequences of increased MTA concentrations on S. Typhimurium virulence. We found that MTA--but not other related metabolites involved in polyamine synthesis and methionine salvage--reduced motility, host cell pyroptosis, and cellular invasion. Further, we developed a genetic model of increased bacterial endogenous MTA production by knocking out the master repressor of the methionine regulon, metJ. Like MTA treated S. Typhimurium, the {Delta}metJ mutant displayed reduced motility, host cell pyroptosis, and invasion. These phenotypic effects of MTA correlated with suppression of flagellar and Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1) networks. {Delta}metJ S. Typhimurium had reduced virulence in oral infection of C57BL/6 mice. Finally, {Delta}metJ bacteria induced a less severe inflammatory cytokine response in a mouse sepsis model. These data provide a possible bacterial mechanism for our previous findings that pretreating mice with MTA dampens inflammation and prolongs survival. Together, these data indicate that exposure of S.

Although its reliability and applicability have been proven in numerous scientific studies, metabarcoding still suffers from some drawbacks. One is the usually mandatory destruction of specimens before DNA extraction, which is problematic because it does not allow a later taxonomic evaluation of the results. Additionally, metabarcoding often implements a time-consuming step, where specimens need to be separated from substrate or sorted in different size classes. A non-destructive protocol, excluding any sorting step, where the extraction of DNA is conducted from a samples fixative (ethanol) could serve as an alternative. We test an innovative protocol, where the sample preserving ethanol is filtered and DNA extracted from the filter for subsequent DNA metabarcoding. We first tested the general functionality of this approach on 15 mock communities comprising one individual of eight different macroinvertebrate taxa each and tried to increase DNA yield through different treatments (ultrasonic irradiation, shaking, freezing). Application of the method was successful for most of the samples and taxa, but showed weaknesses in detecting mollusc taxa. In a second step, the community composition detected in DNA from ethanol was compared to conventional bulk sample metabarcoding of complex environmental samples. We found that especially taxa with pronounced exoskeleton or shells (Coleoptera, Isopoda) and small taxa (Trombidiformes) were underrepresented in ethanol samples regarding taxa diversity and read numbers. However, read numbers of Diptera (mainly chironomids) and Haplotaxida were higher in ethanol derived DNA samples, which might indicate the detection of stomach content, which would be an additional advantage of this approach. Concerning EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) taxa which are decisive for the determination of ecological statuses, both methods had 46 OTUs in common with 4 unique to the ethanol samples and 10 to the bulk samples. Results indicate that fixative-based metabarcoding is a non-destructive, time-saving alternative for biodiversity assessments focussing on taxa used for ecological status determination. For a comprehensive picture on total biodiversity, the method might however not be sufficient and conventional bulk sample metabarcoding should be applied.","10.1139/gen-2018-0048"

Understanding the genetic basis of insecticide resistance is fundamental for mitigating its impact on crop production and disease control. We performed a GWAS approach with the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to identify the mutations involved in resistance to two widely used classes of insecticides: organophosphates (OPs, parathion) and pyrethroids (deltamethrin). Most variation in parathion resistance was associated with mutations in the target gene Ace, while most variation in deltamethrin resistance was associated with mutations in Cyp6a23, a gene encoding a detoxification enzyme never previously associated with resistance. A \""nested GWAS\"" further revealed the contribution of other loci: Dscam1 and trpl were implicated in resistance to parathion, but only in lines lacking Wolbachia. Cyp6a17, the paralogous gene of Cyp6a23, and CG7627, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, were implicated in deltamethrin resistance. We observed signatures of recent selective sweeps at all of these resistance loci and confirmed that the soft sweep at Ace is indeed driven by the identified resistance mutations. Analysis of allele frequencies in additional population samples revealed that most resistance mutations are segregating across the globe, but that frequencies can vary substantially among populations. Altogether, our data reveal that the widely used OP and pyrethroid insecticides imposed a strong selection pressure on natural insect populations. However, it remains unclear why, in Drosophila, resistance evolved due to changes in the target site for OPs, but due to a detoxification enzyme for pyrethroids.\n\nArticle summaryInsecticides are widely used to control pests and insect vectors of disease. In response to the strong selection pressure exerted by insecticides, resistance has evolved in most insect species. We identified few genes present in several Drosophila melanogaster natural populations implicated in the evolution of resistance against two insecticides widely used today. We identified primary and secondary genes involved in the resistance.

In such cases, details of the mechanochemistry can nonetheless be recovered by analyzing the fluctuations in the recorded traces.

However, to directly link the spatial and the temporal information, a method that simultaneously measures the diffusion in confocal and STED modes is needed.

Lipid storage organelles (lipid droplets, LDs), accumulate in many cell types in response to stress, and it is now clear that LDs function not only as lipid stores but also as dynamic regulators of the stress response. However, whether these LD functions are always protective or can also be deleterious to the cell is unknown. Here, we investigated the consequences of LD accumulation on retinal cell homeostasis in transgenic flies and mice overexpressing fatty acid transport protein (FATP) in retinal pigment cells (RPCs). In wild-type Drosophila, overexpression of dFatp specifically in RPCs resulted in an expansion of LD size in both RPCs and in neighboring photoreceptors but was non-toxic. Similarly, in mice, LD accumulation induced by RPC-specific expression of human FATP1 was non-toxic and promoted mitochondrial energy metabolism in both RPCs and photoreceptor cells. In contrast, RPC-specific dFatp knockdown reduced neurodegeneration in Aats-metFB Drosophila mutants, which carry a defective respiratory chain, indicating that abnormal LD accumulation can be toxic under pathological conditions. Collectively, these findings indicate that FATP-mediated LD formation in RPCs induces a non-autonomous increase of LDs in photoreceptors that promotes homeostasis under physiological conditions but can be deleterious under pathological conditions.\n\nAuthor SummaryLipids are major cell constituents and are present in the membranes, as free lipids in the cytoplasm, or stored in vesicles called lipid droplets (LDs). Under conditions of stress, lipids stored in LDs can be released to serve as substrates for energy metabolism by mitochondria. However, lipid storage is deregulated in many degenerative disorders such as age-related macular degeneration and Alzheimers disease. Thus, it is unclear whether accumulation of LDs is protective or can also be toxic. To address this question, we examined the consequences of enforced LD accumulation on the health of retinal cells in flies and mice. Like humans, fly and mouse retinas contain retinal pigment cells (RPC) that support the functions of neighboring photoreceptor cells. We found that overexpression of the fatty acid transport protein (FATP) in RPCs induced accumulation of LDs in both transgenic flies and mice. Moreover, LD accumulation in RPCs had a beneficial effect on juxtaposed photoreceptors under normal physiological conditions, but was toxic under pathological stress conditions. We propose that lipid storage is a mechanism of cellular communication that is essential to maintain photoreceptor health.","NA"

We found that nurses were behaviorally specialized based on larval instar but not on larval caste. This specialization was widespread, with 56% of nurses in the short-term and between 22-27% in the long-term showing significant specialization.

Among the most important factors governing the distributions and the coexistence of species are the spatiotemporal changes occurring in the microhabitat heterogeneity. Here, we assessed the heterogeneity of microhabitats and how they have an effect in the spatial segregation of two species of small mammals (i. e., Peromyscus difficilis and P. melanotis), which coexist in a temperate, mixed forest. We evaluated the microhabitat heterogeneity through multivariate statistics, using onto 23 habitat variables for vertical-horizontal habitat structure along pluvial seasons. To detect specific microdistribution changes and habitat preferences by two species of small mammals, we used second order spatial statistics and general linear models. According to their respective morphology and locomotive adaptations, the middle sized, midscansorial P. difficilis was resident all year long and preferred microhabitats with a high log ground cover, while the opportunistic, small sized, cursorial P. melanotis changed its occupancy area, depending on density of herbaceous and woody plants cover. Under the more benign microhabitat conditions of rainy season (denser plant coverage, milder temperature), both species showed closer microdistribution patterns; while these became repulsive at the less benign conditions of dry season (scarcer plant cover, colder temperature). Thus, we could confirm that seasonal changes of microhabitat heterogeneity promoted Peromyscus coexistence, through dispersion patterns reflecting partition of microhabitat resources.","NA"

Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data.

Vaccine effectiveness is measured from the exposure odds ratio (OR) of vaccination among individuals seeking treatment for acute respiratory illness and receiving a laboratory test for influenza infection. This approach is widely believed to correct for differential healthcare-seeking behavior among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. However, the relation of the measured OR to true vaccine effectiveness is poorly understood. We derive the OR under circumstances of real-world test-negative studies. The OR recovers the true vaccine direct effect when two conditions are met: (1) that individuals vaccination decisions are uncorrelated with exposure or susceptibility to infection, and (2) that vaccination confers \""all-or-nothing\"" protection (whereby certain individuals have no protection while others are perfectly protected). Biased effect size estimates arise if either condition is unmet. Such bias may suggest misleading associations of the OR with time since vaccination or the force of infection of influenza. The test-negative design may also fail to correct for differential healthcare-seeking behavior among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons without stringent criteria for enrollment and testing.

Recent studies suggest that m6A deposition and proteins involved in the m6A pathway play a diverse set of roles in either restricting or modulating the lifecycles of select viruses. Here, we report that m6A levels are significantly increased in cells infected with the oncogenic human DNA virus Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Transcriptome-wide m6A-sequencing of the KSHV-positive renal carcinoma cell line iSLK.219 during lytic reactivation revealed the presence of m6A across multiple kinetic classes of viral transcripts, and a concomitant decrease in m6A levels across much of the host transcriptome. However, we found that depletion of the m6A machinery had differential pro- and anti-viral impacts on viral gene expression depending on the cell-type analyzed. In iSLK.219 and iSLK.BAC16 cells the pathway functioned in a pro-viral manner, as depletion of the m6A writer METTL3 and the reader YTHDF2 significantly impaired virion production. In iSLK.219 cells the defect was linked to their roles in the post-transcriptional accumulation of the major viral lytic transactivator ORF50, which is m6A modified. In contrast, although the ORF50 mRNA was also m6A modified in KSHV infected B cells, ORF50 protein expression was instead increased upon depletion of METTL3, or, to a lesser extent, YTHDF2. These results highlight that the m6A pathway is centrally involved in regulating KSHV gene expression, and underscore how the outcome of this dynamically regulated modification can vary significantly between cell types.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn addition to its roles in regulating cellular RNA fate, methylation at the N6 position of adenosine (m6A) of mRNA has recently emerged as a mechanism for regulating viral infection. While it has been known for over 40 years that the mRNA of nuclear replicating DNA viruses contain m6A, only recently have studies began to examine the distribution of this modification across viral transcripts, as well as characterize its functional impact upon viral lifecycles. Here, we apply m6A-sequencing to map the location of m6A modifications throughout the transcriptome of the oncogenic human DNA virus Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). We show that the m6A machinery functions in a cell type specific manner to either promote or inhibit KSHV gene expression. Thus, the KSHV lifecycle is impacted by the m6A pathway, but the functional outcome may depend on cell lineage specific differences in m6A-based regulation.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1006995"

We find that mavacamten stabilizes an auto-inhibited state of two-headed cardiac myosin, not found in the isolated S1 myosin motor fragment. We determined this by measuring cardiac myosin actin-activated and actin-independent ATPase and single ATP turnover kinetics. A two-headed myosin fragment exhibits distinct auto-inhibited ATP turnover kinetics compared to a single-headed fragment. Mavacamten enhanced this auto-inhibition. It also enhanced auto-inhibition of ADP release. Furthermore, actin changes the structure of the auto-inhibited state by forcing myosin lever-arm rotation. Mavacamten slows this rotation in two-headed myosin but does not prevent it. We conclude that cardiac myosin is regulated in solution by an interaction between its two heads and propose that mavacamten stabilizes this state.\n\nSignificance StatementSmall-molecule allosteric effectors designed to target and modulate striated and smooth myosin isoforms for the treatment of disease show promise in preclinical and clinical trials. Beta-cardiac myosin is an especially important target, as heart disease remains a primary cause of death in the U.S. One prevalent type of heart disease is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is hypothesized to result from dysregulated force generation by cardiac myosin. Mavacamten is a potent cardiac myosin ATPase activity inhibitor that improves cardiac output in HCM animal models. Our results show that mavacamten selectively stabilizes a two-head dependent, auto-inhibited state of cardiac myosin in solution. The kinetics and energetics of this state are consistent with the auto-inhibited super-relaxed state, previously only observed in intact sarcomeres.","10.1073/pnas.1720342115"

However, the typical single-disease focus of microbiome studies limits insight into which microbiome features robustly associate with health, indicate general deviations from health, or predict specific diseases. Additionally, the focus on taxonomy may limit our understanding of how the microbiome relates to health given observations that different taxonomic members can fulfill similar functional roles. To improve our understanding of the association between the gut microbiome and health, we integrated about 2,000 gut metagenomes obtained from eight clinical studies in a statistical meta-analysis.

Moreover, we resolve microbiome modules that stratify diseased individuals from controls in a manner independent of study-specific effects. Many of the differentially abundant functions overlap multiple diseases suggesting a role in host health, while others are specific to a single disease and may associate with disease-specific etiologies.

Such high allele frequency of a derived allele with apparent impact on an otherwise conserved gene is a rare phenomenon. To investigate the evolutionary history of this locus, we analyzed 310 genomes using population genetics tools. Our analysis revealed a surprising lack of linkage disequilibrium between the deletion and the flanking single nucleotide variants in this locus, indicating gene conversion events. Tests that measure extended homozygosity and rapid change in allele frequency identified signatures of an incomplete soft-sweep in the locus. Using empirical approaches, we identified the Tanuki haplogroup, which carries the GSTM1 deletion and is found in approximately 70% of East Asian chromosomes. This haplogroup has rapidly increased its frequency in East Asian populations, contributing to a high population differentiation among continental human populations. We showed that extended homozygosity and population differentiation for this haplogroup is incompatible with simulated neutral expectations in East Asian populations. In parallel, we revealed that the Tanuki haplogroup is significantly associated with the expression levels of other GSTM genes.

Mutations in SVALKA affect the timing of maximal CBF1 expression and freezing tolerance. RNAPII read-through transcription of SVALKA results in a cryptic lncRNA overlapping CBF1 on the antisense strand, termed asCBF1. asCBF1 transcription is anti-correlated with CBF1 expression. Our molecular dissection reveals that CBF1 is suppressed by RNAPII collision stemming from the SVALKA-asCBF1 lncRNA cascade. The SVK-asCBF1 cascade provides a mechanism to tightly control CBF1 expression and timing that could be exploited to maximize freezing tolerance with mitigated fitness costs. Inversion of the transcriptional direction of a lncRNA cascade relative to the genes in a co-regulated cluster provides an elegant inbuilt negative feedback for cluster expression. Our results provide a compelling example of local gene regulation by lncRNA transcription having a profound impact on the ability of plants to appropriately acclimate to suboptimal environmental conditions.","10.1038/s41467-018-07010-6"

D.","Jason D Hinman","UCLA","2018-03-23",1,"15","new results","neuroscience","Obesity is a growing public health problem that increases rates of white matter atrophy and increases the likelihood of ischemic lesions within white matter. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate these changes are unknown. We hypothesized that obesity may alter oligodendrocytes and myelin priming white matter for worsening injury and repair responses after ischemia. C57Bl/6 mice fed a high fat diet (60% kcal from fat) show increased numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), decreased myelin thickness with elevated g-ratios, and shorter paranodal axonal segments, indicating accelerated myelin turnover. Fate mapping of OPCs in PDGFR-CreERT;Rpl22tm1.1Psam mice demonstrated that OPC differentiation rates are enhanced by obesity. Gene expression analyses using a novel oligodendrocyte staging assay demonstrated OPC differentiation is blocked by obesity in between the pre-myelinating and myelinating stage. Using a model of subcortical white matter stroke, the number of stroke-responsive OPCs in obese mice was increased after stroke. At early time points after ischemic white matter stroke, spatial mapping of stroke-responsive OPCs indicates that obesity leads to increased OPCs at the edge of ischemic white matter lesions. At later time points, obesity results in increased OPCs within the ischemic lesion while reducing the number of GST-{pi}-positive mature oligodendrocytes in the lesion core. These data indicate that obesity disrupts normal white matter biology by blocking oligodendrocyte differentiation, leads to an exaggerated response of OPCs to white matter ischemia, and limits remyelination after stroke.\n\nSignificance StatementObesity is a growing public health crisis that specifically increases the development of white matter lesions and silent brain infarcts. This relationship implies a direct cellular effect on white matter yet direct evidence is limited. We modeled diet-induced obesity in mice and studied the effect on oligodendrocyte biology and the response to focal white matter stroke. Adult-onset obesity results in thinner myelin, compromised axonal microdomain structure, and blocks the differentiation of OPCs, leaving the white matter with increased numbers of OPCs. After focal white matter stroke in obese mice, the early OPC response to stroke is exaggerated while late reparative OPC differentiation is blocked. These results suggest that obesity specifically blocks OPC differentiation with consequence on brain repair after stroke.","NA"

We then show that by encoding such signals into a single input, expression mean and variability can be precisely and independently tuned. Further, we construct a light-responsive promoter library and demonstrate how pulsatile signaling also enables graded multi-gene regulation at fixed expression ratios, despite differences in promoter dose-response characteristics. Pulsatile regulation can thus lead to highly beneficial functional behaviors in synthetic biological systems, which previously required laborious optimization of genetic parts or complex construction of synthetic gene networks.","10.1038/s41467-018-05882-2"

Meanwhile, the same mutation increased the mitochondrial respiration of cells grown at 10% glucose. Moreover, SNF4 gene deletion increased respiration and growth at 1% of glucose.

Arousal is supported by norepinephrine (NE) released from locus coeruleus (LC) neurons onto cortical and limbic areas. During development, the NE system matures in concert with increased exploration of the animals environment. While several psychiatric medications target the LC-NE system, the possibility that its modulation during discreet developmental periods can have long-lasting consequences for mental health has not been explored. We used a pharmacogenetic strategy in mice to reversibly inhibit NE signaling during brief developmental periods to determine the long-lasting impact on adult circuits mediating emotional behavior. We also examine whether disruption of NE signaling during development results in permanent changes within the adult LC-NE system. Finally, we test whether developmental exposure to the -2 receptor agonist guanfacine recapitulates the effect seen with our pharmacogenetic strategy. Our results reveal a sensitive period (postnatal days 10-21) during which alterations in NE signaling result in long-term changes in adult emotional behavior. Changes in NE signaling during this sensitive period results in changes in stress-related LC neuron activity, alterations in -2 autoreceptor function, and circuit-specific molecular changes in LC-NE target regions in adulthood. Treating animals with guanfacine during the sensitive period produced similar results.

Knock out of Cx32 and also blockage of Cx32 by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl (2-APB) has been suspected to be beneficial in not only, drug induced liver toxicity, but also in blocking the propagation of an inflammatory signal.

Many cases of horizontal TE transfer (HTT) been reported in animals and plants, however surprisingly few examples of HTT have been reported in fungi.\n\nFindingsHere I report evidence for a novel HTT event in fungi involving Tsu4 in Saccharomyces paradoxus based on (i) high similarity between Tsu4 elements in S. paradoxus and S. uvarum, (ii) a patchy distribution of Tsu4 in S. paradoxus and general absence from its sister species S. cerevisiae, and (iii) discordance between the phylogenetic history of Tsu4 sequences and species in the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group. Available data suggests the HTT event likely occurred somewhere in the Nearctic, Neotropic or Indo-Australian part of the S. paradoxus species range, and that a lineage related to S. uvarum or S. eubayanus was the donor species. The HTT event has led to massive proliferation of Tsu4 in the South American lineage of S. paradoxus, which exhibits partial reproductive isolation with other strains of this species because of multiple reciprocal translocations. Full-length Tsu4 elements are associated with both breakpoints of one of these reciprocal translocations.\n\nConclusionsThis work shows that comprehensive analysis of TE sequences in essentially-complete genome assemblies derived from long-read sequencing provides new opportunities to detect HTT events in fungi and other organisms. This work also provides support for the hypothesis that HTT and subsequent TE proliferation can induce genome rearrangements that contribute to post-zygotic isolation in yeast.","10.1186/s13100-018-0122-7"

One emerging field of research is that of the host-associated honey bee microbiome: a group of bacterial phylotypes consistently found within the honey bee, which may play critical roles such as protection from pathogens and nutrient acquisition. In other model systems, host-associated microbial communities are known to participate in a form of bacterial communication known as quorum sensing. This type of communication allows bacteria to sense their environment and respond with changes in gene expression, controlling a number of factors including virulence, biofilm formation, and cell motility. Here, we have investigated the production of a specific quorum sensing molecule by honey bee microbes in vivo and in vitro. We specifically focused on the inter-species signaling molecule, autoinducer-2 (AI-2). We identified the production of AI-2 by both the entire community (using honey bee gut homogenates) and by cultured isolates, using a Vibrio harveyi biosensor. By comparing newly emerged and adult bees, we showed this signal is likely coming from the core microbial community. Finally, using honey bee specific bacterial isolates, we identified changes in biofilm production when isolates are exposed to increased levels of exogenous AI-2. Altogether, these data provide multiple lines of evidence for the presence of quorum sensing inside the honey bee host. The effect of AI-2 on biofilm formation by honey bee specific bacteria identifies one potential avenue for quorum sensing to affect host health.\n\nAuthor summaryMicrobial communities associate with every animal on the planet and can have dramatic effects on the health of their host.

Despite the lack of evidence supporting sequence-dependent functions for most elincRNAs, splicing of these transcripts is unexpectedly common. Whether elincRNA splicing is a mere consequence of their cognate enhancer activity or if it directly impacts enhancer-associated cis-regulation remains unanswered.\n\nHere we show that elincRNAs are efficiently and rapidly spliced and that their processing rate is strongly associated with their cognate enhancer activity. This association is supported by: their enrichment in enhancer-specific chromatin signatures; elevated binding of co-transcriptional regulators, including CBP and p300; increased local intra-chromosomal DNA contacts; and strengthened cis-regulation on target gene expression.

Relevant to the p hypothesis, recent genetic research has found surprisingly high genetic correlations between pairs of psychiatric disorders. Here, for the first time we compare genetic correlations from different methods and examine their support for a genetic p factor. We tested the hypothesis of a genetic p factor by using principal component analysis on matrices of genetic correlations between major psychiatric disorders estimated by three methods - family study, Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis, and Linkage-Disequilibrium Score Regression - and on a matrix of polygenic score correlations constructed for each individual in a UK-representative sample of 7,026 unrelated individuals. All disorders loaded on a first unrotated principal component, which accounted for 57%, 43%, 34% and 19% of the variance respectively for each method. Our results showed that all four methods provided strong support for a genetic p factor that represents the pinnacle of the hierarchical genetic architecture of psychopathology.","10.1038/s41398-018-0217-4"

Both antigens generated productive primary responses, as evidenced by GC development, circulating antigen-specific antibodies, and differentiation of memory B cells. However, in the MOG response the status of the cognate T cell partner drove preferential B cell differentiation to a memory phenotype at the expense of GC maintenance, resulting in a truncated GC.

In contrast, 2DG promotes IL-17A production by Th17 cells, even in the presence of IL-2 known to limit Th17 differentiation, whilst totally abrogating the production of IL-10. Notably, rather than inhibiting glycolysis, 2DG acts through the inhibition of glycosylation, which is critical for IL-2R surface expression and downstream signaling in both mouse and man. Strikingly, IL-2 is essential for IL-10 production by Th17 cells, in contrast to its inhibitory effect on the production of IL-17A.

As expected, the termites groomed pathogen-exposed individuals significantly more than mock-treated controls; however, grooming levels were significantly higher after spore germination than before. Cannibalism became prevalent only after exposed termites became visibly ill, and burial was rarely observed. These results demonstrate that termites employ different strategies depending on the stage of infection that they encounter.

Conspecific sperm precedence (CSP), which occurs when females that have mated with both conspecific and heterospecific males preferentially use conspecific sperm for fertilization, might contribute to species coexistence by mitigating the costs of interspecific mating and hybridization. We examined whether two closely related species exhibiting CSP can coexist in a local environment in the presence of reproductive interference. First, using a behaviourally explicit mathematical model, we demonstrated that two species characterized by negative mating interactions are unlikely to coexist because the costs of reproductive interference, such as loss of mating opportunity with conspecific partners, are inevitably incurred when individuals of both species are present. Second, we experimentally demonstrated differences in mating activity and preference in two Harmonia ladybird species known to exhibit CSP. According to the developed mathematical model of reproductive interference, these behavioural differences should lead to local extinction of H. yedoensis because of reproductive interference by H. axyridis. This prediction is consistent with field observations that H. axyridis uses various food sources and habitats whereas H. yedoensis is confined to a less preferred prey item and a pine tree habitat. Finally, by a comparative approach, we showed that niche partitioning or parapatric distribution, but not sympatric coexistence in the same habitat, is maintained between species with CSP belonging to a wide range of taxa, including vertebrates and invertebrates living in aquatic or terrestrial environments. Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that reproductive interference generally destabilizes local coexistence even in closely related species that exhibit CSP.","NA"

However, studies published in the past two decades have conclusively shown that a number of organisms do not age, or at least do not age on a scale comparable with other aging organisms. This disparity leads us to question why aging evolved in some organisms and not in others. We thus present a mathematical model which simulates evolution in a sexually reproducing population composed of aging and non-aging individuals. We have observed that aging individuals may outcompete non-aging individuals if they have a higher starting fertility or if the main mating pattern in the population is assortative mating. Furthermore, stronger pathogen pressure was found to help the aging phenotype when compared to the non-aging phenotype. Last but not least, the aging phenotype was found to more easily outcompete the non-aging one or to resist the dominance of the latter for a longer period of time in populations composed of dimorphic sexually reproducing individuals compared to populations of hermaphrodites. Our findings are consistent with both classical evolutionary theories of aging and with evolutionary theories of aging which assume the existence of an aging program. They can thus potentially work as a bridge between these two opposing views, suggesting that the truth in fact lies somewhere in between.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study presents the first mathematical model which simulates the evolution of aging in a population of sexually reproducing organisms. Our model shows that aging individuals may outcompete non-aging individuals in several scenarios known to occur in nature. Our work thus provides important insight into the question why aging has evolved in most, but not all, organisms.","10.1038/s41598-018-34391-x"

Prior research has identified static neural connectivity correlates of this trait. Here, we use dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analysis of resting-state fMRI to study time-varying connectivity patterns associated with naturally varying and objectively measured trait mindfulness. Participants were selected from the top and bottom tertiles of performers on a breath-counting task to form high trait mindfulness (HTM; N = 21) and low trait mindfulness (LTM; N = 18) groups. DFC analysis of resting state fMRI data revealed that the HTM group spent significantly more time in a brain state associated with task-readiness - a state characterized by high within-network connectivity and greater anti-correlations between task-positive networks and the default-mode network (DMN). The HTM group transitioned between brain states more frequently, but the dwell time in each episode of the task-ready state was equivalent between groups. These results persisted even after controlling for vigilance. Across individuals, certain connectivity metrics were weakly correlated with self-reported mindfulness as measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, though these did not survive multiple comparisons correction. In the static connectivity maps, HTM individuals had greater within-network connectivity in the DMN and the salience network, and greater anti-correlations between the DMN and task-positive networks.

The mechanisms that govern the allocation of attention resources can be productively described with a terminology that is more often applied to the control of overt behaviours, namely, the distinction between instrumental and Pavlovian control, and between model-free and model-based control. While instrumental control of VMAC can be either model-free or model-based, it is not known whether Pavlovian control of VMAC can be model-based. To decide whether this is possible we measured Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) while 20 healthy adults took part in a novel task. During the learning stage participants underwent aversive threat conditioning with two CSs, one that predicted pain (CS+) and one that predicted safety (CS-). Instructions given prior to the test stage in the task allowed participants to infer whether novel, ambiguous CSs (new CS+/ new CS-) were threatening or safe. Correct inference required combining stored internal representations and new propositional information, the hallmark of model-based control. SSVEP amplitudes quantified the amount of attention allocated to novel CSs on their very first presentation, before they were ever reinforced. We found that SSVEPs were higher for new CS+ than new CS-. Because task design precluded model-free or instrumental control this result demonstrates a model-based Pavlovian control of VMAC. It confirms, in the domain of internal resource allocation, the model-based Pavlovian control of incentive behaviour and underlines the potential transformative role of information as an emotion regulation technique.","10.1162/jocn_a_01329"

To understand potential drivers and consequences of the underlying heterogeneity in mutation rate across tumours, we evaluated both local and global measures of mutation density: both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA breaks in 2,460 tumours of 38 cancer types. We find that SCNAs in thousands of genes are associated with elevated rates of point-mutations, while similarly point-mutation patterns in dozens of genes are associated with specific patterns of DNA double-stranded breaks. These candidate drivers of mutation density are enriched for known cancer drivers, and preferentially occur early in tumour evolution, appearing clonally in all cells of a tumour. To supplement this understanding of global mutation density, we developed and validated a tool called SeqKat to identify localized \""rainstorms\"" of point-mutations (kataegis). We show that rates of kataegis differ by four orders of magnitude across tumour types, with malignant lymphomas showing the highest. Tumours with TP53 mutations were 2.6-times more likely to harbour a kataegic event than those without, and 239 SCNAs were associated with elevated rates of kataegis, including loss of the tumour-suppressor CDKN2A. We identify novel subtypes of kataegic events not associated with aberrant APOBEC activity, and find that these are localized to specific cellular regions, enriched for MYC-target genes. Kataegic events were associated with patient survival in some, but not all tumour types, highlighting a combination of global and tumour-type specific effects.

We analyzed genetic, brain imaging, and cognitive test data from the UK Biobank, the Dunedin Study, the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP), and the Duke Neurogenetics Study (DNS) (combined N=8,271). We measured genetics using polygenic scores based on published GWAS. We conducted meta-analysis to test associations among participants genetics, total brain volume (i.e., brain size), and cognitive test performance. Consistent with previous findings, participants with higher polygenic scores achieved higher scores on cognitive tests, as did participants with larger brains. Participants with higher polygenic scores also had larger brains. We found some evidence that brain size partly mediated associations between participants education polygenic scores and their cognitive test performance. Effect-sizes were larger in the population-based UK Biobank and Dunedin samples than in the GSP and DNS samples. Sensitivity analysis suggested this effect-size difference partly reflected restricted range of cognitive performance in the GSP and DNS samples.

This project aims to remove nanoparticles during wastewater treatment using genetically modified Escherichia coli in two ways: 1) binding citrate-capped nanoparticles with the membrane protein Proteorhodopsin, and 2) trapping nanoparticles using Escherichia coli biofilm produced by overexpressing two regulators: OmpR234 and CsgD. We demonstrate experimentally that Escherichia coli expressing Proteorhodopsin binds to 60 nm citrate-capped silver nanoparticles. We also successfully upregulate biofilm production and show that Escherichia coli biofilms are able to trap 30 nm gold particles. Finally, both Proteorhodopsin and biofilm approaches are able to bind and remove nanoparticles in simulated wastewater treatment tanks.

This control incorporates the intrinsic physical anisotropy of tubes to generate proportionate organs that match their function. The exact mechanisms underlying tube size control and how tubular anisotropy is translated at the cellular level are still not fully understood. Here we investigate these mechanisms using the Drosophila tracheal system. We show that the apical polarity protein Crumbs transiently accumulates anisotropically at longitudinal cell junctions during tube elongation. We provide evidence indicating that the accumulation of Crumbs in specific apical domains correlates with apical surface growth. Hence, we propose that the anisotropic accumulation of Crb at the cellular level promotes a bias towards longitudinal membrane growth, orienting cell elongation and, as a consequence, longitudinal growth at the tissue level. We find that Src42A promotes Crb anisotropic accumulation, thereby identifying the first polarised cell behaviour downstream of Src42A. Our results indicate that Src42A activity favours a higher turnover of Crb protein at longitudinal junctions, possibly through a mechanism regulating protein trafficking and/or recycling. We propose a model where Src42A would sense the inherent anisotropic mechanical tension of the tube and translate it into a polarised Crumbs-mediated membrane growth, orienting longitudinal tube growth. This work provides new insights into the key question of how organ growth is controlled and polarised and unveils the function of two conserved proteins, Crumbs and Src42A, with important roles in development and homeostasis as well as in disease, in this biological process.","NA"

Targeting modifier genes to improve disease phenotypes could be especially beneficial in cases where the causative genes are large, structurally complex and the mutations are heterogeneous. Here, we report a mutation-independent strategy to upregulate expression of a compensatory disease-modifying gene in Congenital Muscular Dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) using a CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activation system. MDC1A is caused by nonfunctional Laminin 2, which compromises muscle fibers stability and axon myelination in peripheral nerves 1. Transgenic overexpression of Lama1, encoding a structurally similar protein Laminin 1, ameliorates muscle wasting and paralysis in the MDC1A mouse models, demonstrating its role as a protective disease modifier 2. Yet, upregulation of Lama1 as a postnatal gene therapy is hampered by its large size, which exceeds the current genome packaging capacity of clinically relevant delivery vehicles such as adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs). In this study, we sought to upregulate Lama1 using CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activation system, comprised of catalytically inactive S. aureus Cas9 (dCas9) fused to VP64 transactivation domains and sgRNAs targeting the Lama1 promoter. We first demonstrated robust upregulation of Lama1 in myoblasts, and following AAV9-mediated intramuscular delivery, in skeletal muscles of dy2j/dy2j mouse model of MDC1A.\n\nWe therefore assessed whether systemic upregulation of Lama1 would yield therapeutic benefits in dy2j/dy2j mice. When the intervention was started early in pre-symptomatic dy2j/dy2j mice, Lama1 upregulation prevented muscle fibrosis and hindlimb paralysis. An important question for future therapeutic approaches for a variety of disorders concerns the therapeutic window and phenotypic reversibility. This is particularly true for muscular dystrophies as it has long been hypothesized that fibrotic changes in skeletal muscle represent an irreversible disease state that would impair any therapeutic intervention at advanced stages of the disease. Here, we demonstrate that dystrophic features and disease progression were significantly improved and partially reversed when the treatment was initiated in symptomatic 3-week old dy2j/dy2j mice with already-apparent hind limb paralysis and significant muscle fibrosis.\n\nCollectively, our data demonstrate the feasibility and therapeutic benefit of CRISPR/dCas9-mediated modulation of a disease modifier gene, which opens up an entirely new and mutation-independent treatment approach for all MDC1A patients. Moreover, this treatment strategy provides evidence that muscle fibrosis can be reversible, thus extending the therapeutic window for this disorder. Our data provide a proof-of-concept strategy that can be applied to a variety of disease modifier genes and a powerful therapeutic approach for various inherited and acquired diseases.","10.1038/s41586-019-1430-x"

The earliest step in familiar face recognition is thought to be matching a perceptual representation of a familiar face to a stored representation of that face, which is thought to be indexed by the N250r event-related potential (ERP). In the current face priming studies, we investigated whether this perceptual representation can be effectively activated by feature-based processing. In the first experiment, prime images were familiar whole faces, isolated eyes, or isolated mouths. Whole faces and isolated eyes, but not isolated mouths, effectively modulated the N250r. In the second experiment, prime images were familiar whole faces presented either upright or inverted. Inverted face primes were no less effective than upright face primes in modulating the N250r. Together, the results of these studies indicate that activation of the earliest face recognition processes is not dependent on holistic processing of a typically configured face. Rather, feature-based processing can effectively activate the perceptual memory of a familiar face.

However, the distribution of responses across trials and individuals is heterogeneous and not necessarily everyone in a given group of individuals perceives the effect. Nonetheless, existing studies in the field primarily focus on addressing the correlation between subjective behavior and cortical activations to reveal the neuronal mechanisms underlying the perception of McGurk effect, typically in the \""frequent perceivers\"". Additionally, a solely neuroimaging approach does not provide mechanistic explanation for the observed inter-trial or inter-individual heterogeneity. In the current study we employ high density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in a group of 25 human subjects that allow us to distinguish \""frequent perceivers\"" from \""rare perceivers\"" using behavioral responses as well as from the perspective of large-scale brain functional connectivity (FC). Using global coherence as a measure of large-scale FC, we find that alpha band coherence, a distinctive feature in frequent perceivers is absent in the rare perceivers. Secondly, a decrease in alpha band coherence and increase in gamma band coherence occur during illusory perception trials in both frequent and rare perceivers. Source analysis followed up with source time series reconstructions reveals a large scale network of brain areas involving frontal, temporal and parietal areas that are involved in network level processing of cross-modal perception. Finally, we demonstrate that how a biophysically realistic computational model representing the interaction among key neuronal systems (visual, auditory and multisensory cortical regions) can explain the empirical observations. Each system involves a group of excitatory and inhibitory Hindmarsh Rose neurons that are coupled amongst each other. Large-scale FC between areas is conceptualized using coupling functions and the identity of a specific system, e.g., visual/ auditory/ multisensory is chosen using empirical estimates of the time-scale of information processing in these systems. The model predicts that the disappearance of alpha band coherence observed in rare perceivers stems from a negligible direct A-V (audio-visual) coupling however, an increase in indirect interaction via multisensory node leads to enhanced gamma band and reduced alpha band coherences observed during illusory perception. Overall, we establish the mechanistic basis of large-scale FC patterns underlying cross-modal perception.","NA"

To further investigate the mechanism of growth traits in beef cattle, we conducted whole exome analysis of 20 cattle with phenotypic differences on body girth and length, representing the first systematic exploration of rare variants on body measurements in cattle. By carrying out a three-phase process of the variant calling and filtering, a sum of 1158, 1151, 1267, and 1303 rare variants were identified in four phenotypic groups of two growth traits, higher/ lower body girth (BG_H and BG_L) and higher/lower body length (BL_H and BL_L) respectively. The subsequent functional enrichment analysis revealed that these rare variants distributed in 886 genes associated with collagen formation and organelle organization, indicating the importance of collagen formation and organelle organization for body size growth in cattle. The integrative network construction distinguished 62 and 66 genes with different co-expression patterns associated with higher and lower phenotypic groups of body measurements respectively, and the two sub-networks were distinct. Gene ontology and pathway annotation further showed that all shared genes in phenotypic differences participate in many biological processes related to the growth and development of the organism.

Here, it was demonstrated that inhibition of GLAST expression limited the progression and invasion of GBM xenografts. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure glutamate in GLAST-expressing gliomas showing that these tumors exhibit increased glutamate concentration. Despite their GLAST expression, GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) released rather than took up glutamate due to their lack of Na+/K+-ATPase. Overexpression of Na+/K+-ATPase in these cells restored glutamate uptake and induced apoptosis. The therapeutic relevance of targeting GLAST in gliomas was assessed using the inhibitor UCPH-101. In glioma-bearing mice, a single intratumoral injection of UCPH-101 significantly increased survival by decreasing GLAST expression and inducing apoptosis.

In ectothermic organisms, including Drosophila and Cephalopoda, where body temperature mirrors ambient temperature, decreases in environmental temperature lead to increases in A-to-I RNA editing and cause amino acid recoding events that are thought to be adaptive responses to temperature fluctuations. In contrast, endothermic mammals, including humans and mice, typically maintain a constant body temperature despite environmental changes. Here, A-to-I editing primarily targets repeat elements, rarely results in the recoding of amino acids and plays a critical role in innate immune tolerance. Hibernating ground squirrels provide a unique opportunity to examine RNA editing in a heterothermic mammal whose body temperature varies over 30{degrees}C and can be maintained at 5{degrees}C for many days during torpor. We profiled the transcriptome in three brain regions at six physiological states to quantify RNA editing and determine whether cold-induced RNA editing modifies the transcriptome as a potential mechanism for neuroprotection at low temperature during hibernation. We identified 5,165 A-to-I editing sites in 1,205 genes with dynamically increased editing after prolonged cold exposure. The majority (99.6%) of the cold-increased editing sites are outside of previously annotated coding regions, 82.7% lie in SINE-derived repeats, and 12 sites are predicted to recode amino acids. Additionally, A-to-I editing frequencies increase with increasing cold-exposure demonstrating that ADAR remains active during torpor.

The genomic representation of archaeal biodiversity has since significantly increased. In addition, advances in phylogenetic modeling of multi-locus datasets have resolved many recalcitrant branches of the ToL. Despite the technical advances and an expanded taxonomic representation, two important aspects of the origins and evolution of the Archaea remain controversial, even as we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the monumental discovery. These issues concern (i) the uniqueness (monophyly) of the Archaea, and (ii) the evolutionary relationships of the Archaea to the Bacteria and the Eukarya; both of these are relevant to the deep structure of the ToL. Here, to explore the causes for this persistent ambiguity, I examine multiple datasets that support contradicting conclusions. Results indicate that the uncertainty is primarily due to a scarcity of information in standard datasets -- the core genes datasets -- to reliably resolve the conflicts. These conflicts can be resolved efficiently by comparing patterns of variation in the distribution of functional genomic signatures, which are less diffused unlike patterns of primary sequence variation.

It also infers both marker gene networks and their dynamic changes as well as dynamic characteristics of transcriptional bursting along the cell-state transition trajectories. Applying this method to single-cell RNA-seq data on the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, we not only identified three known cell types but also estimated both their fate probabilities and transition probabilities among them. We found that the percent of genes expressed in a bursty manner is significantly higher at (or near) the branch point ([~]97%) than before or after branch (below 80%), and that both gene-gene and cell-cell correlation degrees are apparently lower near the branch point than away from the branching.

Advanced PSF models such as spline fits to experimental PSFs or the vectorial PSF model can be used in the corresponding localization algorithms in order to model the intricate spot shape and deformations correctly. The complexity of the optical architecture and fit model makes PSF engineering approaches particularly sensitive to optical aberrations. Here, we present a calibration and alignment protocol for fluorescence microscopes equipped with a spatial light modulator (SLM) with the goal of establishing a wavefront error well below the diffraction limit for optimum application of complex engineered PSFs. We achieve high-precision wavefront control, to a level below 20 m{lambda} wavefront aberration over a 30 minute time window after the calibration procedure, using a separate light path for calibrating the pixel-to-pixel variations of the SLM, and alignment of the SLM with respect to the optical axis and Fourier plane within 3 {micro}m (x/y) and 100 {micro}m (z) error. Aberrations are retrieved from a fit of the vectorial PSF model to a bead z-stack and compensated with a residual wavefront error comparable to the error of the SLM calibration step. This well-calibrated and corrected setup makes it possible to create complex  3D+{lambda} PSFs that fit very well to the vectorial PSF model.

Here we describe the genome sequencing and assessment of plant-growth promoting abilities of S. marcescens UENF-22GI (SMU), a strain isolated from mature cattle manure vermicompost. In vitro, SMU is able to solubilize P and Zn, to produce indole compounds (likely IAA), to colonize hyphae and counter the growth of two phytopathogenic fungi. Inoculation of maize with SMU remarkably increased seedling growth and biomass under greenhouse conditions. The SMU genome has 5 Mb, assembled in 17 scaffolds comprising 4,662 genes (4,528 are protein-coding). No plasmids were identified. SMU is phylogenetically placed within a clade comprised almost exclusively of environmental strains. We were able to find the genes and operons that are likely responsible for all the interesting plant-growth promoting features that were experimentally described. Genes involved other interesting properties that were not experimentally tested (e.g. tolerance against metal contamination) were also identified. The SMU genome harbors a horizontally-transferred genomic island involved in antibiotic production, antibiotic resistance, and anti-phage defense via a novel ADP-ribosyltransferase-like protein and possible modification of DNA by a deazapurine base, which likely contributes to the SMU competitiveness against other bacteria. Collectively, our results suggest that S. marcescens UENF-22GI is a strong candidate to be used in the enrichment of substrates for plant growth promotion or as part of bioinoculants for Agriculture.","10.1186/s12864-018-5130-y"

The effectiveness of morphometric techniques in discovering the groups is evaluated using statistical learning tools. No one technique proved optimal in classification on every occasion, linear morphometric techniques slightly out-performing geometric (72.6% accuracy on test set versus 66.7%). The combined use of these techniques with post-hoc knowledge of their individual successes with particular cultivars achieves a notably higher classification accuracy (77.8%). From this we conclude that even with pre-determined discrete categories, a range of approaches is needed where those categories are intrinsically similar to each other, and we raise the question of whether in studies where potentially continuous natural variation is being categorised the level of match between categories is routinely set too high.","10.1371/journal.pone.0205357"

Most synthetic circuits regulate populational behaviors via cell-to-cell communications, which are affected by spatially heterogenous environments. Therefore, it is important to understand the limits on controlling system dynamics that are determined by interconnections among cell agents and provide a control strategy for engineering consortia. Here, we build a network model for a fractional population control circuit in two-strain consortia, and characterize the cell-to-cell communication network by topological properties, such as symmetry, locality and connectivity. Using linear network control theory, we relate the network topology to system outputs tracking performance. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that the minimum network control energy for accurate tracking depends on locality difference between two cell populations spatial distributions and how strongly the controller node contributes to communication strength. To realize a robust consortia, we can manipulate the communication network topology and construct strongly connected consortia by altering chemicals in environments. Our results ground the expected cell population dynamics in its spatially organized communication network, and inspire directions in cooperative control in microbial consortia.","NA"

Human studies of flexibility using reversal learning tasks typically contrast error trials before and after reversal, which provides little information about the mechanisms that support learning and expressing a new response. However, animal studies suggest a specific role in this latter process for the connections between the dorsal striatum and the centromedian parafascicular (CM-Pf) thalamus, a system which may recruit the striatal cholinergic interneurons, but which is not well understood in humans. This study investigated the role of this system in human probabilistic reversal learning, specifically with respect to learning a new response strategy, contrasting its function to that of the better understood orbitoftontal-striatal systems. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data we show that connectivity between the striatum and both the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and CM-Pf pathways increased during reversal, but not initial learning. However, while the strength of lOFC-striatal connectivity was associated with the speed of the reversal, the strength of CM-Pf-striatal connectivity was associated specifically with the quality of the reversal (reduced regressive errors).

Evaluation of CRISPR/Cas9 induced loss of function in the top 6 genes failed to demonstrate a clear rescue phenotype. However, a maternally inherited (not ENU-induced) de novo mutation (Plcb4R335Q) exhibited significant co-segregation with the rescue phenotype (p=0.003) in the corresponding pedigree. Thrombosis suppression by heterozygous Plcb4 loss of function was confirmed through analysis of an independent, CRISPR/Cas9-induced Plcb4 mutation (p=0.01).\n\nAuthor summaryAbnormal blood clotting in veins (venous thrombosis) or arteries (arterial thrombosis) are major health problems, with venous thrombosis affecting approximately 1 in every thousand individuals annually in the United States. Susceptibility to venous thrombosis is governed by both genes and environment, with approximately 60% of the risk attributed to genetic influences. Though several genetic risk factors are known, >50% of genetic risk remains unexplained. Approximately 5% of people carry the most common known risk factor, Factor V Leiden. However, only 10% of these individuals will develop a blood clot in their lifetime. Mice carrying two copies of the Factor V Leiden mutation together with a mutation in a second gene called tissue factor pathway inhibitor develop fatal thrombosis shortly after birth. To identify genes that prevent this fatal thrombosis, we studied a large panel of mice carrying inactivating gene changes randomly distributed throughout the genome. We identified several genes as potential candidates to alter blood clotting balance in mice and humans with predisposition to thrombosis, and confirmed this protective function for DNA changes in one of these genes (Plcb4).","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007658"

However, two sources of error can diminish collective wisdom: individual estimation biases and information sharing between individuals. Here we measure individual biases and social influence rules in multiple experiments involving hundreds of individuals performing a classic numerosity estimation task. We first investigate how existing aggregation methods, such as calculating the arithmetic mean or the median, are influenced by these sources of error. We show that the mean tends to overestimate, and the median underestimate, the true value for a wide range of numerosities. Quantifying estimation bias, and mapping individual bias to collective bias, allows us to develop and validate three new aggregation measures that effectively counter sources of collective estimation error. In addition, we present results from a further experiment that quantifies the social influence rules that individuals employ when incorporating personal estimates with social information. We show that the corrected mean is remarkably robust to social influence, retaining high accuracy in the presence or absence of social influence, across numerosities, and across different methods for averaging social information. Utilizing knowledge of estimation biases and social influence rules may therefore be an inexpensive and general strategy to improve the wisdom of crowds.","10.1098/rsif.2018.0130"

It is the raw material on which acts selection, it improves species and communities resilience to disturbance and it affects the way species modulate their biotic and abiotic environment. Understanding patterns and underlying determinants of genetic and phenotypic intraspecific diversity is therefore of critical importance for ecological, evolutionary and conservation sciences. Here, focusing on two freshwater fish species (Gobio occitaniae and Phoxinus phoxinus) sampled across a large river basin (the Garonne-Dordogne river basin, France), we used causal analyses to test for genetic-phenotypic intraspecific diversity correlations (GPIDCs) and unravel the processes underlying intraspecific diversity patterns. Genetic diversity was assessed using microsatellite markers and phenotypic diversity was assessed through geometric morphometrics. We found disparities in the distribution of genetic and phenotypic diversity in the two species, suggesting higher level of local adaptation in G. occitaniae, and our results revealed common and contrasted processes shaping diversity at the - and {beta}-level. At the -level, we found no GPIDC in both species despite common relations between isolation and genetic and phenotypic -diversity in G. occitaniae. At the {beta}-level, we found no GPIDC in P. phoxinus but we found a positive GPIDC in G. occitaniae. This correlation appeared to be caused by a direct impact of one facet of intraspecific diversity on the other, and we speculated that it could originate from positive assortative mating. Studying neutral genetic diversity and phenotypic diversity within an integrative framework appears as a valuable way of deciphering the complex and diverse impacts of neutral and adaptive processes on intraspecific diversity patterns.","NA"

Majority of genes expressed during spermatogenesis are autosomal. Mice with different deletions of Yq show sub-fertility and sterility, depending on the length of deletion. The connection between Yq deletion and autosomal gene regulation was not well studied before. We describe a novel multi-copy mouse Yq-derived long noncoding RNA, Pirmy (piRNA from mouse Y chromosome), which shows unprecedented alternative splicing in testis. Further, Pirmy acts as a template for several piRNAs in mouse testis. Mice with deletions of Yq including the region of Pirmy exhibit differential male fertility, aberrant sperm morphology, motility and sex ratio skewed towards females. We identified deregulation of ten autosome-encoded sperm proteins in a Y-deleted strain of mouse. Pirmy splice variants have homology to 5/3 UTRs of these deregulated autosomal genes. Thus, subfertility in Y-deleted mice appears to be a polygenic phenomenon that is partially regulated epistatically by the Y-encoded Pirmy. Our study provides novel and interesting insights into possible role of MSY-derived noncoding RNAs in male fertility and reproduction. Finally, sperm phenotypes from Y-deleted mice seem to be similar to that reported in inter-specific male-sterile hybrids. Taken together, this study provides novel insights into possible role of Y-derived noncoding RNAs in male sterility and speciation.\n\nSignificanceOur study adds new dimensions to the repertoire of functions that Y-heterochromatin has with respect to autosomal gene regulation in male fertility.

We identify sperm proteins that are deregulated in Yq-deleted mice; corresponding genes map to autosomes and display sequence homology to piRNAs derived from Pirmy in their UTRs. Thus, piRNAs from species-specific repeats appear to regulate autosomal genes involved in reproduction.

Early studies of humans with amnesia led to the hippocampus being viewed as the critical structure for episodic memory, but human lesions are imprecise, making it difficult to identify the anatomical structures underlying memory impairments. Rodent studies enable great temporal and anatomical precision in hippocampal manipulations, but not investigation of the rich assortment of interleaved memories that occurs in humans. Thus it is not known how lesions restricted to the hippocampus affect the retrieval of multiple sequentially encoded memories. Furthermore, disagreement exists as to whether hippocampal inactivations lead to a temporally graded, or ungraded amnesia, which could be a consequence of different types hippocampal disruption observed in rodent and human studies. In the current study, four rhesus monkeys received bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and were compared to thirteen unoperated controls on recognition and new learning of visual object-in-place scenes. Monkeys with hippocampal lesions were significantly impaired compared to controls at remembering scenes that were encoded before the lesion. We did not observe any temporal gradient effect of the lesion on memory recognition, with recent and remote memories being equally affected by the lesion. Monkeys with hippocampal lesions showed no deficits in learning and later recognising new scenes. Thus, the hippocampus, like other cortical regions, may be engaged in the acquisition and storage of new memories, but its role can be taken over by spared regions following a lesion. These findings illustrate the utility of experimental paradigms for studying retrograde and anterograde amnesia that make use of the capacity of nonhuman primates to rapidly acquire many distinct visual memories.","10.1523/jneurosci.0832-18.2018"

Inspired by the \""moneyball\"" approach used in baseball to integrate diverse features to predict player success, we hypothesized that a similar approach could leverage existing adverse event and tissue-specific toxicity data to learn how to predict adverse events. We introduce MAESTER, a data-driven machine learning approach that integrates information on a compounds structure, targets, and phenotypic effects with tissue-wide genomic profiling and our toxic target database to predict the probability of a compound presenting with different types of tissue-specific adverse events. When tested on 6 different types of adverse events MAESTER maintains a high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity across both the training data and new test sets. Additionally, MAESTER scores could flag a number of drugs that were approved, but later withdrawn due to unknown adverse events - highlighting its potential to identify events missed by traditional methods. MAESTER can also be used to identify toxic targets for each tissue type. Overall MAESTER provides a broadly applicable framework to identify toxic targets and predict specific adverse events and can accelerate the drug development pipeline and drive the design of new safer compounds.","NA"

The estimation performance of sampling procedures is commonly evaluated in computer simulations for single psychometric functions and reported using metrics as a function of number of trials. However, the estimation performance of a sampling procedure may vary for different psychometric functions. Therefore, the results of these type of evaluations may not be generalizable to a heterogeneous population of interest. In addition, the maximum number of trials is often imposed by time restrictions, especially in clinical applications, making trial-based metrics suboptimal. Hence, the benefit of these simulations to select and tune an ideal sampling procedure for a specific application is limited. We suggest to evaluate the estimation performance of sampling procedures in simulations covering the entire range of psychometric functions found in a population of interest, and propose a comprehensive set of performance metrics for a detailed analysis. To illustrate the information gained from these metrics in an application example, six sampling procedures were evaluated in a computer simulation based on prior knowledge on the population distribution and requirements from proprioceptive assessments. The metrics revealed limitations of the sampling procedures, such as inhomogeneous or systematically decreasing performance depending on the psychometric functions, which can inform the tuning process of a sampling procedure. More advanced metrics allowed directly comparing overall performances of different sampling procedures and select the best-suited sampling procedure for the example application. The proposed analysis metrics can be used for any sampling procedure and the estimation of any parameter of a psychometric function, independent of the shape of the psychometric function and of how such a parameter was estimated. This framework should help to accelerate the development process of psychophysical assessments.","10.1371/journal.pone.0207217"

It has been proposed that this occurred in a single series of vicariant speciation events. An alternative hypothesis is denoted giant-dwarf speciation: piscivores would have evolved in sympatry by character displacement and cannibalism. We test the plausibility of both scenarios using size measures combined with distributional data and new phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers.\n\nOur analysis uses historical biogeography models and Ornstein-Uehlenbeck processes describing trait evolution across the posterior distributions of phylogenetic trees. Large species most likely evolved three times from small ones. For the clade containing A. elongatus, we argue that vicariance was not involved in the origin of these large and specialized piscivores. They experience stabilizing selection with an optimum shifted towards larger bodies and longer jaws. The branch leading to this clade has the fastest evolving jaw lengths across the phylogeny, in agreement with expectations for giant-dwarf speciation. For A. wolterstorffi, the support for giant-dwarf speciation is weaker. When the species is placed at the root of Austrolebias, ancestral reconstructions are unreliable and vicariance cannot be ruled out. For the remaining large species, we can reject vicariance and giant dwarf speciation. Our results give rise to two new additional scenarios for the evolution of specialized piscivores. In the first, two successive speciation events in sympatry or parapatry produced large and piscivorous species. In the second, the immigration of a different annual killifish genus (Cynopoecilus) in the Patos area of endemism has contributed to in-situ diversification of Austrolebias species.","NA"

The aim of the present study was to assess whether the color polymorphism of G. cancriformis may be maintained by pressure from multiple signal receivers, such as prey and predators with distinct color vision systems. Although, the multiple receivers world is a more realistic scenario, it has received little attention. In orb-web spiders, the prey attraction hypothesis states that conspicuous colors are prey lures that increase spider foraging success via flower mimicry. However, in highly defended species, conspicuous colors could also be a warning signal to predators. We used color vision modelling to estimate chromatic and achromatic contrast of G. cancriformis morphs as perceived by potential prey and predator taxa. Our results revealed that individual prey and predator taxa perceive the conspicuousness of morphs differently. For instance, the red morph is perceived as quite conspicuous to lepidopteran prey and avian predators, but not by other insects. Therefore, the multiple prey and predator hypotheses may explain the evolution of color polymorphism in G. cancriformis. However, flower mimicry hypothesis was weakly corroborated. Other parameters that are not evaluated by color vision models, such as distance, shape, angle, and pattern geometry could also affect the perception of color morphs by both prey and predators and thereby influence morph survival.","NA"

Arterial spin labelling (ASL) offers an attractive alternative. This study used arm repositioning to evoke clinically-relevant musculoskeletal pain in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. Fifty-five patients were scanned using a multi post-labelling delay pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) sequence, first with both arms along the body and then with the affected arm raised into a painful position. Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned as a control group. Arm repositioning resulted in increased perfusion in brain regions involved in sensory processing and movement integration, such as the contralateral primary motor and primary somatosensory cortex, mid- and posterior cingulate cortex, and, bilaterally, in the insular cortex/operculum, putamen, thalamus, midbrain and cerebellum. Perfusion in the thalamus, midbrain and cerebellum was larger in the patient group. Results of a post hoc analysis suggested that the observed perfusion changes were related to pain rather than arm repositioning. This study showed that ASL can be useful in research on clinical ongoing musculoskeletal pain but the technique is not sensitive enough to detect small differences in perfusion.","NA"

Unfortunately, fMRI data also contain structured temporal \""noise\"" from a variety of sources, including subject motion, subject physiology, and the MRI equipment. Recently, methods have been developed to automatically and selectively remove spatially specific structured noise from fMRI data using spatial Independent Components Analysis (ICA) and machine learning classifiers. Spatial ICA is particularly effective at removing spatially specific structured noise from high temporal and spatial resolution fMRI data of the type acquired by the Human Connectome Project and similar studies. However, spatial ICA is mathematically, by design, unable to separate spatially widespread \""global\"" structured noise from fMRI data (e.g., blood flow modulations from subject respiration). No methods currently exist to selectively and completely remove global structured noise while retaining the global signal from neural activity. This has left the field in a quandary--to do or not to do global signal regression--given that both choices have substantial downsides. Here we show that temporal ICA can selectively segregate and remove global structured noise while retaining global neural signal in both task-based and resting state fMRI data. We compare the results before and after temporal ICA cleanup to those from global signal regression and show that temporal ICA cleanup removes the global positive biases caused by global physiological noise without inducing the network-specific negative biases of global signal regression. We believe that temporal ICA cleanup provides a \""best of both worlds\"" solution to the global signal and global noise dilemma and that temporal ICA itself unlocks interesting neurobiological insights from fMRI data.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.04.076"

We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories.

As with many neurodegenerative diseases, studies of pathogenesis have been hindered by a lack of disease-relevant models. To this end, we have generated the first induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from South African SCA7 patients, where the disease occurs at an unusually high frequency as a result of a founder effect. These iPSCs were capable of differentiation into neural and retinal cells, and showed evidence of a transcriptional phenotype affecting components of STAGA (ATXN7 and KAT2A) and the heat shock protein pathway (DNAJA1 and HSP70). Functionally, SCA7 iPSC-derived neurons exhibited more negative resting membrane potentials and increased input resistance compared to controls, suggesting reduced excitability in response to synaptic input. These results provide the first evidence of a disease phenotype in SCA7 iPSC-derived cells, establishing a valuable model for the study of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of population-specific therapies.","NA"

To address these questions, we have studied the response of primary neurons to oncogenic deregulation using a fusion protein based on truncated Cyclin E and Cdk2. Oncogenic Cyclin E/Cdk2 elicits mitotic checkpoint signaling, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and cell-death. However, as in mitotic cells, checkpoint suppression enables oncogenic cell-cycle progression and neuronal division. Further, neurons actively adapt to the cell-cycle by losing and reforming the axon initial segment, which integrates synaptic inputs to sustain action potentials. We conclude that neurons are mitotic cells in a reversible quiescent-like state, which is falsely portrayed as irreversible by mitotic checkpoints. In extension, neuronal death in lieu of cell-division reflects oncosuppressive checkpoint signaling.","10.1038/s41598-019-40462-4"

Recent experiments using ex vivo explants challenge this interpretation, suggesting that positional information is encoded in the properties of the oscillators. Here, we propose that positional information is encoded in the differential levels of neighboring oscillators. The differences gradually increase because both the oscillator amplitude and the period increase with time. When this difference exceeds a certain threshold, the segmentation program starts. Using this framework, we quantitatively fit experimental data from in vivo and ex vivo mouse segmentation, and propose mechanisms of somite scaling.

The rate at which an element in a metabolic network accumulates genetic variation via new mutations depends on both the size of the mutational target it presents and its robustness to mutational perturbation. Quantifying the relationship between topological properties of network elements and the mutability of those elements will facilitate understanding the variation in and evolution of networks at the level of populations and higher taxa.\n\nWe report an investigation into the relationship between two topological properties of 29 metabolites in the C. elegans metabolic network and the sensitivity of those metabolites to the cumulative effects of spontaneous mutation. The relationship between several measures of network centrality and sensitivity to mutation is weak, but point estimates of the correlation between network centrality and mutational variance are positive, with only one exception. There is a marginally significant correlation between core number and mutational heritability. There is a small but significant negative correlation between the shortest path length between a pair of metabolites and the mutational correlation between those metabolites.\n\nPositive association between the centrality of a metabolite and its mutational heritability is consistent with centrally-positioned metabolites presenting a larger mutational target than peripheral ones, and is inconsistent with centrality conferring mutational robustness, at least in toto. The weakness of the correlation between shortest path length and the mutational correlation between pairs of metabolites suggests that network locality is an important but not overwhelming factor governing mutational pleiotropy.

How these two genomes coevolve is a long-standing question in evolutionary biology. Here we initially investigate the evolutionary rates of mitochondrial components (oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins and ribosomal RNAs) and nuclear-encoded proteins associated with mitochondria, across the major orders of holometabolous insects. There are significant evolutionary rate correlations (ERCs) between mitochondria and mitochondria-associated nuclear-encoded proteins, which is likely driven by different rates of mitochondrial sequence evolution and compensatory changes in the interacting nuclear-encoded proteins. The pattern holds after correction for phylogenetic relationships and considering protein conservation levels. Correlations are stronger for nuclear-encoded OXPHOS proteins in contact with mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS proteins and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial ribosomal amino acids directly contacting the mitochondrial rRNA. Mitochondrial-associated proteins show apparent rate acceleration over evolutionary time, but we suspect this pattern to be due to artifacts (e.g. rate estimation or calibration bias). We find that ERC between mitochondrial and nuclear proteins is a strong predictor of nuclear proteins known to interact with mitochondria, and therefore ERCs can be used to predict new candidate nuclear proteins with mitochondrial function. Using this approach, we detect proteins with high ERCs but not with known mitochondrial function based on gene ontology (GO). Manual screening of the literature revealed potential mitochondrial function for some of these proteins in humans or yeast. Their holometabolous ERCs therefore indicate these proteins may have phylogenetically conserved mitochondrial function. Twenty three additional candidates warrant further study for mitochondrial function based on this approach, including ERC evidence that proteins in the minichromosome maintenance helicase (MCM) complex interact with mitochondria. We conclude that the ERC method shows promise for identifying new candidate proteins with mitochondrial function.","10.1093/molbev/msz036"

Extracting underlying developmental principles can hence shed light on what genetically encoded instructions must be available during cortical development. Within a generative model, we investigate growth rules for axonal branching patterns in cat area 17, originating from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. This target area of synaptic connections is characterized by extensive ramifications and a high bouton density, characteristics thought to preserve the spatial resolution of receptive fields and to enable connections for the ocular dominance columns. We compare individual and global statistics, such as a newly introduced asymmetry index and the global segment-length distribution, of generated and real branching patterns as the benchmark for growth rules. We show that the proposed model surpasses the statistical accuracy of the Galton-Watson model, which is the most commonly employed model for biological growth processes. In contrast to the Galton-Watson model, our model can recreate the log-normal segment-length distribution of the experimental dataset and is considerably more accurate in recreating individual axonal morphologies. To provide a biophysical interpretation for statistical quantifications of the axonal branching patterns, the generative model is ported into the physically accurate simulation framework of Cx3D. In this simulation environment we demonstrate how the proposed growth process can be formulated as an interactive process between genetic growth rules and chemical cues in the local environment.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007315"

We constructed both conventional within-subject semantic encoding models and between-subject models where the model was trained on a subset of participants and validated on a left-out participant. Between-subject models were trained using cortical surface-based anatomical normalization or surface-based whole-cortex hyperalignment. We used hyperalignment to project group data into an individuals unique anatomical space via a common representational space, thus leveraging a larger volume of data for out-of-sample prediction while preserving the individuals fine-grained functional-anatomical idiosyncrasies. Our findings demonstrate that anatomical normalization degrades the spatial specificity of between-subject encoding models relative to within-subject models. Hyperalignment, on the other hand, recovers the spatial specificity of semantic tuning lost during anatomical normalization, and yields model performance exceeding that of within-subject models.","10.3389/fnins.2018.00437"

Here, we present DeepSignal, a deep learning framework for predicting the substrate specificity for kinase/SH2 sequences with or without mutations. Empowered by the memory and selection mechanism of recurrent neural network, DeepSignal can identify important specificity-defining residues to predict kinase specificity and changes upon mutations. Evaluated on several public benchmark datasets, DeepSignal significantly outperforms current methods on predicting substrate specificity on both kinase and SH2 domains. Further analysis in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrated that DeepSignal is able to aggregate mutations on both kinase/SH2 domains and substrates to quantify binding specificity changes, predict cancer genes related to signaling transduction, and identify novel perturbed pathways.\n\nAvailabilityImplementation of DeepSignal is at https://github.com/luoyunan/DeepSignal","NA"

The lack of understanding of the underlying mechanism of ITH hinders progress in developing effective therapies for cancers. Based on the findings in a recent quantitative experiment on pancreatic cancer we developed a general evolutionary model, accounting for interactions between different cell populations through paracrine or juxtacrine factors. We show that the emergence of a stable heterogeneous state in a tumor requires an unequal allocation of paracrine growth factors (\""public goods\"") between cells that produce them and those that merely consume them. Our model provides a quantitative explanation of recent in vitro experimental studies in pancreatic cancer in which insulin growth factor (IGF-II) plays the role of public goods. The calculated phase diagrams as a function of exogenous resources and fraction of growth factor producing cells show ITH persists only in a narrow range of concentration of exogenous IGF-II. Remarkably, maintenance of ITH requires cooperation among tumor cell subpopulations in harsh conditions, specified by lack of exogenous IGF-II, whereas surplus exogenous IGF-II elicits competition. The theory also quantitatively accounts for measured in vivo tumor growth in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The predictions for GBM tumor growth as a function of the fraction of tumor cells are amenable to experimental tests. The mechanism for ITH also provides hints for devising efficacious therapies.","10.1098/rsif.2018.0820"

Thus, seasonal oscillations in temperate environments between winter and summer might produce cyclical selection pressures that would drive rapid evolution of learning performance in multivoltine populations. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of learning ability over this rapid seasonal timescale in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster. Associative learning was tested in common garden-raised flies collected from nature in the spring and fall over three consecutive years. The spring flies consistently learned better than fall flies, revealing seasonal evolution of improved learning performance in nature. Fecundity showed the opposite seasonal pattern, suggesting a trade-off between learning and reproduction. This trade-off also held within population: more fecund individual females learned less well. This trade-off is mediated at least in part by natural polymorphism in the RNA binding protein couch potato (cpo), with a genotype favoured during summer showing poorer learning performance and higher fecundity than a genotype favoured over winter. Thus, seasonal environments can drive rapid cyclical evolution of learning performance, but the evolutionary dynamics may be driven by trade-offs generated by pleiotropic effects of causative alleles selected for other reasons.","NA"

Proteolytic cleavage decreases Env conformational flexibility, allowing the mature Env to resist antibody binding to conserved elements. The conformational plasticity of the Env precursor skews the humoral immune response towards the elicitation of ineffectual antibodies, contributing to HIV-1 persistence in the infected host. The structural basis for the plasticity of the Env precursor remains elusive. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to visualize two coexisting conformational states of the full-length Env precursor at nominal resolutions of 5.5 and 8.0 [A].

Decreasing transmission intensity generally leads to increasingly patchy spatial patterns of malaria transmission, however, and control programs must accurately identify remaining foci in order to target interventions efficiently. In particular, mosquito control interventions like bed nets and insecticide spraying are best targeted to transmission hotspots, and the role of connectivity between different pockets of local transmission becomes increasingly important since humans are able to move parasites beyond the limits of mosquito dispersal and re-introduce parasites to previously malaria-free regions. Quantifying the connectivity between regions due to human travel, measuring malaria transmission intensity in different areas, and monitoring parasite spatial spread are therefore key issues for policy-makers because they underpin the feasibility of elimination and inform the path to its attainment. To this end, recent efforts have been made to develop new approaches to incorporating human mobility into spatial epidemiological models, for example using mobile phone data, and there has been a surge of interest in collecting spatially informative parasite samples to measure the genomic signatures of parasite connectivity. Due to their complicated life-cycles, Plasmodium parasites pose unique challenges to researchers in this respect and new methods that move beyond traditional phylogenetic and population genetic tools must be developed to harness genetic information effectively. Here, we discuss the spatial epidemiology of malaria in the context of transmission-reduction interventions, and the challenges and promising directions for the development of integrated mapping, modeling, and genomic approaches that leverage disparate data sets to measure both connectivity and transmission.","10.1186/s12916-018-1181-9"

Using the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS/NHAMCS), the Human Microbiome Project, and additional carriage and etiological data from existing literature, we estimate the magnitude of bystander selection for a range of clinically relevant antibiotic-species pairs as the proportion of all exposures of an antibiotic experienced by a species for conditions in which that species was not the causative pathogen (\""proportion of bystander exposures\""). For outpatient prescribing in the United States, we find that this proportion over all included antibiotics is over 80% for 8 out of 9 organisms of interest. Low proportions of bystander exposure are often associated with infrequent bacterial carriage or a high proportion of antibiotic prescribing focused on conditions caused by the species of interest. Using the proportion of bystander exposures, we roughly estimate that S. aureus and E. coli may benefit from 90.7% and 99.7%, respectively, of the estimated reduction in antibiotic use due to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, despite not being the pathogen targeted by the vaccine. These results underscore the importance of considering antibiotic exposures to bystanders, in addition to the targeted pathogen, in measuring the impact of antibiotic resistance interventions.\n\nSignificance StatementThe forces that contribute to changing population prevalence of antibiotic resistance are not well understood. Bystander selection -- the inadvertent pressures imposed by antibiotics on the microbial flora other than the pathogen targeted by treatment -- is hypothesized to be a major factor in the propagation of antibiotic resistance, but its extent has not been characterized. We estimate the proportion of bystander exposures across a range of antibiotics and organisms and describe factors driving variability of these proportions. Impact estimates for antibiotic resistance interventions, including vaccination, are often limited to effects on a target pathogen. However, the reduction of antibiotic treatment for illnesses caused by the target pathogen may have the broader potential to decrease bystander selection pressures for resistance on many other organisms.","10.1073/pnas.1810840115"

One popular approach to identify de novo genes is phylostratigraphy, which consists of determining the approximate time of origin (age) of a gene based on its distribution along a species phylogeny. Several studies have revealed significant flaws in determining the age of genes, including de novo genes, using phylostratigraphy alone. However, the rate of false positives in de novo gene surveys, based on phylostratigraphy, remains unknown. Here, I re-analyze the findings from three studies, two of which identified tens to hundreds of rodent-specific de novo genes adopting a phylostratigraphy-centered approach. Most of the putative de novo genes discovered in these investigations are no longer included in recently updated mouse gene sets. Using a combination of synteny information and sequence similarity searches, I show that about 60% of the remaining 381 putative de novo genes share homology with genes from other vertebrates, originated through gene duplication, and/or share no synteny information with non-rodent mammals. These results led to an estimated rate of [~]12 de novo genes per million year in mouse. Contrary to a previous study (Wilson et al. 2017), I found no evidence supporting the preadaptation hypothesis of de novo gene formation.

Control interfaces typically get more complicated with increasing complexity of the robotic tasks and the environment. Traditional control modalities as touch, speech or gesture commands are not necessarily suited for all users. While non-expert users can make the effort to familiarize themselves with a robotic system, paralyzed users may not be capable of controlling such systems even though they need robotic assistance most. In this paper, we present a novel framework, that allows these users to interact with a robotic service assistant in a closed-loop fashion, using only thoughts. The system is composed of several interacting components: non-invasive neuronal signal recording and co-adaptive deep learning which form the brain-computer interface (BCI), high-level task planning based on referring expressions, navigation and manipulation planning as well as environmental perception. We extensively evaluate the BCI in various tasks, determine the performance of the goal formulation user interface and investigate its intuitiveness in a user study. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the system in real world scenarios, considering fetch-and-carry tasks and tasks involving human-robot interaction. As our results show, the system is capable of adapting to frequent changes in the environment and reliably accomplishes given tasks within a reasonable amount of time. Combined with high-level planning using referring expressions and autonomous robotic systems, interesting new perspectives open up for non-invasive BCI-based human-robot interactions.","NA"

However, interpretation of individual raft proteomics studies are confounded by the limitations of isolation methods and the dynamic nature of rafts. Knowledge-based approaches can facilitate biological data interpretation by integrating experimental evidence from existing studies. To this end, we previously developed RaftProt (http://lipid-raft-database.di.uq.edu.au/), a searchable database of mammalian lipid raft-associated proteins.

Here, we present RaftProt V2 (http://raftprot.org), an improved update of RaftProt, enabling interrogation and integration of datasets at the cell/tissue type and UniRef/Gene level. Besides the addition of new datasets and re-mapping of all entries to both UniProt and UniRef IDs, we have annotated the level of experimental evidence for each protein entry. The search engine now allows for multiple protein or experiment searches where correlations, interactions or overlaps can be investigated. The web-interface has been completely re-designed and offers new interactive tools for data and subset selection, correlation analysis and network visualization.

NMR spectroscopy could provide these data in high-throughput, and it has already been applied in epidemiological settings to analyse urine samples. However, quantitative protocols for large-scale applications are not available.\n\nMethodsWe describe in detail how to prepare urine samples and perform NMR experiments to obtain quantitative metabolic information. Semi-automated quantitative lineshape fitting analyses were set up for 43 metabolites and applied to data from various analytical test samples and from 1,004 individuals from a population-based epidemiological cohort. Novel analyses on how urine metabolites associate with quantitative serum NMR metabolomics data (61 metabolic measures; n=995) were performed. In addition, confirmatory genome-wide analyses of urine metabolites were conducted (n=578). The fully automated quantitative regression-based spectral analysis is demonstrated for creatinine and glucose (n= 4,548).\n\nResultsIntra-assay metabolite variations were mostly <5% indicating high robustness and accuracy of the urine NMR spectroscopy methodology per se. Intra-individual metabolite variations were large, ranging from 6% to 194%. However, population-based inter-individual metabolite variations were even larger (from 14% to 1655%), providing a sound base for epidemiological applications. Metabolic associations between urine and serum were found clearly weaker than those within serum and within urine, indicating that urinary metabolomics data provide independent metabolic information. Two previous genome-wide hits for formate and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate were replicated at genome-wide significance.\n\nConclusionsQuantitative urine metabolomics data suggest broad novelty for systems epidemiology.

Chronotype is the behavioural manifestation of circadian rhythm and Mendelian randomisation (MR) involves the use of genetic variants to explore causal effects of exposures on outcomes. This study aimed to explore a causal relationship between chronotype and coffee consumption on risk of PD.\n\nMethodsTwo-sample MR was undertaken using publicly available GWAS data. Associations between genetic instrumental variables (IV) and \""morning person\"" (one extreme of chronotype) were obtained from the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc., and UK Biobank, and consisted of the per-allele odds ratio of being a \""morning person\"" for 15 independent variants. The per-allele difference in log-odds of PD for each variant was estimated from a recent meta-analysis. The inverse variance weight method was used to estimate an odds ratio (OR) for the effect of being a \""morning person\"" on PD. Additional MR methods were used to check for bias in the IVW estimate, arising through violation of MR assumptions. The results were compared to analyses employing a genetic instrument of coffee consumption, because coffee consumption has been previously inversely linked to PD.\n\nFindingsBeing a \""morning person\"" was causally linked with risk of PD (OR 1*27; 95% confidence interval 1*06-1*51; p=0*012). Sensitivity analyses did not suggest that invalid instruments were biasing the effect estimate and there was no evidence for a reverse causal relationship between liability for PD and chronotype. There was no robust evidence for a causal effect of high coffee consumption using IV analysis, but the effect was imprecisely estimated (OR 1*12; 95% CI 0*89-1*42; p=0*22).\n\nInterpretationWe observed causal evidence to support the notion that being a \""morning person\"", a phenotype driven by the circadian clock, is associated with a higher risk of PD.

However, it is not clear why depth discrimination (stereoacuity) varies more significantly among people than other modalities. Previous studies reported the involvement of both dorsal and ventral visual areas in stereopsis, implying that not only neural computations in cortical areas but also the anatomical properties of white matter tracts connecting those areas can impact stereopsis and stereoacuity. Here, we studied how human stereoacuity relates to white matter properties by combining psychophysics, diffusion MRI (dMRI), and quantitative MRI (qMRI). We performed a psychophysical experiment to measure stereoacuity, and in the same participants we analyzed the microstructural properties of visual white matter tracts based on two independent measurements, dMRI (fractional anisotropy, FA) and qMRI (macromolecular tissue volume; MTV). Microstructural properties along the right vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF), a major tract connecting dorsal and ventral visual areas, were highly correlated with measures of stereoacuity. This result was consistent for both FA and MTV, suggesting that the structural-behavioral relationship reflects differences in neural tissue density, rather than differences in the morphological configuration of fibers. fMRI confirmed that binocular disparity stimuli activated the dorsal and ventral visual regions near VOF endpoints. No other occipital tracts explained the variance in stereoacuity. In addition, the VOF properties were not associated with differences in performance on a different psychophysical task (contrast detection). These series of experiments suggest that stereoscopic depth discrimination performance is, at least in part, constrained by dorso-ventral communication through the VOF.","10.1073/pnas.1804741115"

With experiments in a key inhibitory nucleus in the vertebrate midbrain selection network, called isthmi pars magnocellularis (Imc) in owls, we discovered that the central element is a  multilobe neuron, which encodes visual locations with multiple firing fields. This multilobed coding of space is necessitated by scarcity of Imc neurons. Although distributed seemingly randomly in space, the locations of these lobes are optimized across the high firing Imc neurons, allowing them to cooperatively suppress stimuli throughout 2D visual space while minimizing metabolic and circuit wiring costs. Our work suggests that combinatorial coding of space by sparse inhibitory neurons may be a general functional module for spatial selection.","10.1016/j.celrep.2018.10.022"

The microbiota of 30 farmed Chinook salmon from a single cohort was surveyed using metabarcode profiling of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Seawater, feed and intestinal samples, and controls were sequenced in quadruplicate to assess both biological and technical variation in the microbial profiles.\n\nOver 1,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified within the cohort, providing a first glimpse into the gut microbiota of farmed Chinook salmon. The taxonomic distribution of the salmon microbiota was reasonably stable, with around two thirds of individuals dominated by members of the family Vibrionaceae.\n\nThis survey was performed amid a summer heat wave, during which the fish exhibited reduced feeding. Although the sampled fish appeared healthy, they had minimal intestinal content, and the observed intestinal flora may represent the microbiota of fasting and stressed fish. Limited comparison between Mycoplasma and Vibrio sequences from the Chinook salmon gut and published microbial sequences from the intestines of a variety of fish species (including Atlantic salmon) indicated that despite the starvation and temperature variations, the replacement of Vibrio with Mycoplasma is occurring within expected ecological parameters and does not necessarily reflect colonisation by atypical microbes.\n\nDATA SUMMARYRaw sequences from Chinook salmon intestinal microbiome 16S survey generated on the Illumina platform are publically available through NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database:\n\nBioproject PRJNA421844\n\nSRA study SRP134829\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA421844\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTAlthough 16S metabarcoding surveys are becoming routine, little is still known about the microbiota of fish. This is the first survey of the intestinal microbiota of Chinook salmon, a species native to the Pacific Northwest which is farmed in New Zealand and Chile. While most intestinal microbiota studies are performed on faecal material, we directly sampled the intestine epithelium and content.\n\nDuring the time of sampling, the farmed fish population was experiencing stress from a summer heat wave and had little intestinal content. Over 1,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified within the intestines of the cohort, providing a first glimpse into the gut microbiota of farmed Chinook salmon.\n\nWe believe this survey will be of interest not only to those interested in fish biology and aquaculture, but also as an addition to the ongoing debate in the literature on sampling and DNA extraction methods for challenging samples.","NA"

In this paper, we describe an algorithm to build a deep generative model using predictive coding that can be used to infer latent representations about the stimuli received from external environment. Specifically, we used predictive coding to train a deep neural network on real-world images in a unsupervised learning paradigm. To understand the capacity of the network with regards to modeling the external environment, we studied the latent representations generated by the model on images of objects that are never presented to the model during training.

It is well-established that levels of semantic knowledge increase across the lifespan. However, the effects of ageing on semantic control processes have not been assessed. I addressed this issue by comparing the performance profiles of young and older people on a verbal comprehension test. Two sets of variables were used to predict accuracy and RT in each group: (a) the psycholinguistic properties of words probed in each trial, (b) the performance on each trial by two groups of semantically-impaired neuropsychological patients. Young people demonstrated poor performance for low frequency and abstract words, suggesting that they had difficulty processing words with intrinsically weak semantic representations. Indeed, performance in this group was strongly predicted by the performance of patients with semantic dementia, who suffer from degradation of semantic knowledge. In contrast, older adults performed poorly on trials where the target semantic relationship was weak and distractor relationships strong - conditions which require high levels of controlled processing. Their performance was not predicted by the performance of semantic dementia patients, but was predicted by the performance of patients with semantic control deficits. These findings indicate that the effects of ageing on semantic cognition are more complex than has previously been assumed. While older people have larger stores of knowledge than young people, they appear to be less skilled at exercising control over the activation of this knowledge.","10.1111/jnp.12159"

Arginine clusters in the highly methylated RNA binding protein SYNCRIP were experimentally shown to function in concert providing a tunable protein interaction interface. Quantitative immuno-precipitation assays defined two distinct cumulative regulatory mechanisms operating across 18 proximal arginine-glycine motifs in SYNCRIP. Functional binding to the methyl-transferase PRMT1 was promoted by continual arginine stretches while interaction with the methyl-binding protein SMN1 was arginine content dependent irrespective of linear position within the unstructured region.

Here, we demonstrate that CypB is a critical regulator of tubule epithelial cell plasticity on the basis that: i) CypB silencing caused epithelial differentiation in proximal tubule-derived HK-2 cells, ii) CypB silencing prevented TGF{beta}-induced EMT in HK-2, and iii) CypB knockdown mice exhibited reduced UUO-induced inflammation and kidney fibrosis. By contrast, silencing of CypA induces a more undifferentiated phenotype and favors TGF{beta} effects. EMT mediators Slug and Snail were up-regulated in CypA-silenced cells, while in CypB silencing, Slug, but not Snail, was down-regulated; thus, reinforcing the role of Slug in kidney fibrosis. CypA regulates Slug through its PPIase activity whereas CypB depends on its ER location, where interacts with calreticulin, a calcium modulator which is involved in TGF{beta} signaling.

Summarizing and visually representing these patterns of diversity has been a persistent goal for human geneticists5-10, and has revealed that genetic differentiation is frequently correlated with geographic distance. However, most analytical methods to represent population structure11-15 do not incorporate geography directly, and it must be considered post hoc alongside a visual summary. Here, we use a recently developed spatially explicit method to estimate \""effective migration\"" surfaces to visualize how human genetic diversity is geographically structured (the EEMS method16). The resulting surfaces are \""rugged\"", which indicates the relationship between genetic and geographic distance is heterogenous and distorted as a rule. Most prominently, topographic and marine features regularly align with increased genetic differentiation (e.g. the Sahara desert, Mediterranean Sea or Himalaya at large scales; the Adriatic, interisland straits in near Oceania at smaller scales). In other cases, the locations of historical migrations and boundaries of language families align with migration features. These results provide visualizations of human genetic diversity that reveal local patterns of differentiation in detail and emphasize that while genetic similarity generally decays with geographic distance, there have regularly been factors that subtly distort the underlying relationship across space observed today. The fine-scale population structure depicted here is relevant to understanding complex processes of human population history and may provide insights for geographic patterning in rare variants and heritable disease risk.","10.1093/molbev/msz280"

This is achieved by using a compendium of pre-built modules as well as a generic module, both do not require programming expertise. Nonetheless, NeatSeq-Flow retains the flexibility to generate sophisticated WF modules using templates and only basic Python programming abilities. NeatSeq-Flow is designed to enable easy sharing of WFs and modules by conceptually separating modules, WF design, sample information and execution. Moreover, NeatSeq-Flow works hand in hand with CONDA environments for easy installation of the WFs analysis programs in one go. NeatSeq-Flow enables efficient WF execution on computer clusters by parallelizing on both samples and WF steps. NeatSeq-Flow operates by shell-script generation; thus it allows full transparency of the WF process. NeatSeq-Flow offers real-time WF execution monitoring, detailed documentation and self-sustaining WF backups for reproducibility.

Here, we examine how conflict deriving from objective and subjective value characteristics of stocks, as well as the behavioural and phenomenological correlates of decision conflict, are accompanied by variation in a thus far understudied ERP component, the conflict negativity (CN). In a novel EEG paradigm (N = 53), we simulated a financial decision situation in which participants made incentivized choices between different, sometimes conflicting, stock options. Our results indicate that participants become slower, more undecided, and less pleased, when choosing between similar options compared to choices in which one option clearly outweighs the other. This effect even held when participants chose between two objectively good alternatives. We further provide preliminary evidence that the CN, a negative-going ERP recorded over the medial prefrontal cortex, is not only sensitive to decision conflict, but also predicts behavioural indecision. What is more, subjective value characteristics of stocks, impressions based on brand perception of the stock options, modestly influenced affective and behavioural reactions over and above objective stock characteristics. While our results are at odds with assumptions made by classic economic theory, they may serve as one out of several indicators as to why private investors seem to avoid financial decisions.","NA"

The latency to first seizure ranged from 3 to 7 days. Seizure duration was bimodal, with both short (approximately 30s) and long-lasting (>100s) seizures occurring in the same animals. Seizures were accompanied by non-motor features such as behavioural arrest, or motor seizures with or without evolution to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Seizures were commoner during the sleep phase of a light-dark cycle.

Accumulating evidence of the predominantly local expression of these individual oscillatory rhythms suggests that their interaction may have a similar local component. However, it is unclear whether local coupling holds uniformly across the cortex, and whether and how these dynamics differ between fast and slow spindles, and sleep stages. Moreover, substantial individual variability in the expression of both spindles and slow oscillations raise the possibility that their cross-frequency interactions show similar individual differences. Using two nights of multi-channel electroencephalography recordings from 24 healthy individuals, we characterized the topography of slow oscillation-spindle coupling. We found that locally coupled oscillations occur over widespread cortical areas, but that their dynamics vary with spindle class, sleep stage, and location. Moreover, the phase of the slow oscillation cycle at which spindles were expressed differed markedly across individuals but was stable across nights. However, individual variability of coupling phase was not correlated with overnight memory change. These findings both add an important spatial aspect to our understanding of the temporal coupling of sleep oscillations and demonstrate the heterogeneity of coupling dynamics, which must be taken into account when formulating mechanistic accounts of sleep-related memory processing.","10.1093/sleep/zsy175"

We define two subclasses of OB DA neuron by the presence or absence of a key subcellular specialisation: the axon initial segment (AIS). Large AIS-positive axon-bearing DA neurons are exclusively produced during early embryonic stages, leaving small anaxonic AIS-negative cells as the only DA subtype generated via adult neurogenesis. These populations are functionally distinct: large DA cells are more excitable, yet display weaker and - for certain long-latency or inhibitory events - more broadly-tuned responses to odorant stimuli.

It is, however, critical to fully appreciate the impact of any modified or novel experimental design features on the expected results. Here, we use two concrete examples to demonstrate that relatively small changes in the two-stage task design can substantially change the pattern of actions taken by model-free and model-based agents as a function of the reward outcomes and transitions on previous trials. In the first, we show that, under specific conditions, purely model-free agents will produce the reward by transition interactions typically thought to characterize model-based behavior on a two-stage task. The second example shows that model-based agents behavior is driven by a main effect of transition-type in addition to the canonical reward by transition interaction whenever the reward probabilities of the final states do not sum to one. Together, these examples emphasize the task-dependence of model-free and model-based behavior and highlight the benefits of using computer simulations to determine what pattern of results to expect from both model-free and model-based agents performing a given two-stage decision task in order to design choice paradigms and analysis strategies best suited to the current question.","10.1371/journal.pone.0195328"

Therefore, as a first step in clarifying the phenomenon, we studied the ballooning behavior of relatively large spiders (heavier than 5 mg) in nature. Additional wind tunnel tests to identify ballooning silks were implemented in the laboratory. From our observation, it seems obvious that spiders actively evaluate the condition of the wind with their front leg (leg I) and wait for the preferable wind condition for their ballooning takeoff. In the wind tunnel tests, as yet unknown physical properties of ballooning fibers (length, thickness and number of fibers) were identified. Large spiders, 16-20 mg Xysticus species, spun 50 to 60 nanoscale fibers, with a diameter of 121 to 323 nm. The length of these threads was 3.22 {+/-} 1.31 m (N = 22). These physical properties of ballooning fibers can explain the ballooning of large spiders with relatively light updrafts, 0.1-0.5 m s-1, which exist in a light breeze of 1.5-3.3 m s-1. Additionally, in line with previous research on turbulence in atmospheric boundary layers and from our wind measurements, it is hypothesized that spiders use the ascending air current for their aerial dispersal, the \""ejection\"" regime, which is induced by hairpin vortices in the atmospheric boundary layer turbulence. This regime is highly correlated with lower wind speeds. This coincides well with the fact that spiders usually balloon when the wind speed is lower than 3 m s-1.","10.1371/journal.pbio.2004405"

To further understand how genetic variation between and within species affects IFN{lambda}4 function, we screened a panel of extant coding variants of human IFN{lambda}4 and identified three variants that substantially affect antiviral activity (P70S, L79F and K154E). The most notable variant was K154E, which enhanced in vitro activity in a range of antiviral and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) assays. This more active E154 variant of IFN{lambda}4 was found only in African Congo rainforest  Pygmy hunter-gatherers. Remarkably, E154 was highly conserved as the ancestral residue in mammalian IFN{lambda}4s yet K154 is the dominant variant throughout evolution of the hominid genus Homo. Compared to chimpanzee IFN{lambda}4, the human orthologue had reduced activity due to amino acid substitution of glutamic acid with lysine at position 154. Meta-analysis of published gene expression data from humans and chimpanzees showed that this difference in activity between K154 and E154 in IFN{lambda}4 is consistent with differences in antiviral gene expression in vivo during HCV infection. Mechanistically, our data suggest that human-specific K154 likely affects IFN{lambda}4 activity by reducing secretion and potency. We postulate that evolution of an IFN{lambda}4 with attenuated activity in humans (K154) likely contributes to distinct host-specific responses to and outcomes of infection, such as HCV.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007307"

The accuracy of this process is largely dependent on the availability of machine-readable resources associating synonyms and abbreviations commonly found in biomedical literature with uniform identifiers.\n\nResultsIn a task involving automated reading of [~]215,000 articles using the REACH event extraction software we found that grounding was disproportionately inaccurate for multi-protein families (e.g., \""AKT\"") and complexes with multiple subunits (e.g.\""NF-{kappa}B\""). To address this problem we constructed FamPlex, a manually curated resource defining protein families and complexes as they are commonly encountered in biomedical text. In FamPlex the gene-level constituents of families and complexes are defined in a flexible format allowing for multi-level, hierarchical membership. To create FamPlex, text strings corresponding to entities were identified empirically from literature and linked manually to uniform identifiers; these identifiers were also mapped to equivalent entries in multiple related databases. FamPlex also includes curated prefix and suffix patterns that improve named entity recognition and event extraction. Evaluation of REACH extractions on a test corpus of [~]54,000 articles showed that FamPlex significantly increased grounding accuracy for families and complexes (from 15% to 71%). The hierarchical organization of entities in FamPlex also made it possible to integrate otherwise unconnected mechanistic information across families, subfamilies, and individual proteins. Applications of FamPlex to the TRIPS/DRUM reading system and the Biocreative VI Bioentity Normalization Task dataset demonstrated the utility of FamPlex in other settings.\n\nConclusionFamPlex is an effective resource for improving named entity recognition, grounding, and relationship resolution in automated reading of biomedical text.

How these combine to shape behavioural responses of urban-dwelling species is unclear.\nC_LIO_LIUsing web-building, an easily quantifiable behaviour linked to body size, and the garden spider Araneus diadematus as a model, we disentangle direct behavioural responses to urbanization and body size constraints across a network of 63 selected populations differing in urbanization intensity at two spatial scales.\nC_LIO_LISpiders were smaller in highly urbanized sites (local scale only), in line with expectations based on reduced prey biomass availability and the Urban Heat Island effect. The use of multivariate mixed modelling reveals that although web traits and body size are correlated within populations, behavioural responses to urbanization do not appear to be constrained by size: there is no evidence of size-web correlations among populations or among landscapes. Spiders thus altered different components of their web-building behaviours independently in response to urbanization: mesh width and web surface decreased independently with urbanization at the local scale, while web surface also increased with urbanization at the landscape scale. These responses are expected to compensate, at least in part, for reduced prey biomass availability.\nC_LIO_LIOur results demonstrate that responses in typically size-dependent behaviours may be decoupled from size changes, thereby allowing fitness maximisation in novel environments. The spatial scale of the behavioural responses to urbanization suggest contributions of both genetic adaptation and plasticity. Although fecundity decreased with local-scale urbanization, Araneus diadematus abundances were remarkably similar across urbanization gradients; behavioural responses thus appear overall successful at the population level.\nC_LI","NA"

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic attenuation of Nfkbid expression in NOD mice resulted in improved negative selection of autoreactive diabetogenic AI4 and NY8.3 CD8+ T-cells. These results indicated allelic variants of Nfkbid represent an Idd7 gene contributing to the efficiency of intrathymic deletion of diabetogenic CD8+ T-cells.

Algorithms that select SNPs which are close and connected on a biological network have been successful in finding biologically-interpretable and predictive loci. However, we argue that the connectedness constraint favors selecting redundant features that affect similar biological processes and therefore does not necessarily yield better predictive performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called SPADIS that selects SNPs that cover diverse regions in the underlying SNP-SNP network. SPADIS favors the selection of remotely located SNPs in order to account for the complementary additive effects of SNPs that are associated with the phenotype. This is achieved by maximizing a submodular set function with a greedy algorithm that ensures a constant factor (1-1/e) approximation. We compare SPADIS to the state-of-the-art method SConES, on a dataset of Arabidopsis Thaliana genotype and continuous flowering time phenotypes. SPADIS has better regression performance in 12 out of 17 phenotypes on average, it identifies more candidate genes and runs faster. We also investigate the use of Hi-C data to construct SNP-SNP network in the context of SNP selection problem for the first time, which yields slight but consistent improvements in regression performance.

In order to properly assess specialization, it is imperative to measure parasite fitness across host species; to understand its origins, fitness must be decomposed into the underlying traits. Despite the omnipresence of parasites with multiple hosts, very few studies assess and decompose their specialization in this way. To bridge this gap, we quantified the infectivity, virulence, and transmission rate of two parasites, the horizontally transmitted microsporidians Anostracospora rigaudi and Enterocytospora artemiae, in their natural hosts, the brine shrimp Artemia parthenogenetica and Artemia franciscana. Our results demonstrate that each parasite performs well on one of the two host species (A. rigaudi on A. parthenogenetica, and E. artemiae on A. franciscana), and poorly on the other. This partial specialization is driven by high infectivity and transmission rates in the preferred host, and is associated with maladaptive virulence and large costs of resistance in the other. Our study represents a rare empirical contribution to the study of parasite evolution in multi-host systems, highlighting the negative effects of under- and over-exploitation when adapting to multiple hosts.","10.1002/evl3.65"

Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are long-lived, fossorial, eusocial rodents that display remarkable behavioral/cellular hypoxia and hypercapnia resistance.

Here, we show with whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of cultured NMR and mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons that NMR neurons have smaller voltage-gated Na+ channel currents and more hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials. We further demonstrate that acid-mediated currents in NMR neurons are of smaller magnitude than in mouse, and that all currents in both species are fully blocked by the ASIC antagonist benzamil. We further demonstrate that NMR neurons show greater resistance to acid-induced cell death than mouse neurons. In summary, NMR neurons show significant cellular resistance to acidotoxicity compared to mouse neurons, contributing factors likely to be smaller ASIC-mediated currents and reduced NaV activity.\n\nAbbreviationsASIC, acid-sensing ion channel; CNS, central nervous system; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; NaV, voltage-gated Na+ channel; NMR, naked mole-rat; TTX, tetrodotoxin","10.1186/s13041-018-0369-4"

During the target search in genomic sequences, TF moves on highly rugged landscapes and occasionally flips on DNA depending on the sequence. The TATA-binding protein exhibits two remarkably distinct binding modes, of which frequencies differ between TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters.

In vivo, cancer cells are exposed to directional guidance cues, either soluble, such as gradients of growth factors, or insoluble, such as collagen fiber alignment. Depending on the number and strength of such cues, cells will migrate in a random or directed manner. Interestingly, similar cues also stimulate cell proliferation. In this regard, it is not clear whether cell cycle progression affects migration of cancer cells and whether this effect is different in random versus directed migration. In this study, we tested the effect of cell cycle progression on random and directed migration, both in 2D and 3D environments, in the breast carcinoma cell line, FUCCI-MDA-MB-231, using computational image analysis by LEVER. Directed migration in 2D was modeled as chemotaxis along a gradient of soluble EGF inside 10 {micro}m-wide microchannels. In 3D, directed migration was modeled as contact guidance (alignotaxis) along aligned collagen fibers.

Using the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS/NHAMCS), the Human Microbiome Project, and additional carriage and etiological data from existing literature, we estimate the magnitude of bystander selection for a range of clinically relevant antibiotic-species pairs as the proportion of all exposures of an antibiotic experienced by a species for conditions in which that species was not the causative pathogen (\""proportion of bystander exposures\""). For outpatient prescribing in the United States, we find that this proportion over all included antibiotics is over 80% for 8 out of 9 organisms of interest. Low proportions of bystander exposure are often associated with infrequent bacterial carriage or a high proportion of antibiotic prescribing focused on conditions caused by the species of interest. Using the proportion of bystander exposures, we roughly estimate that S. aureus and E. coli may benefit from 90.7% and 99.7%, respectively, of the estimated reduction in antibiotic use due to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, despite not being the pathogen targeted by the vaccine. These results underscore the importance of considering antibiotic exposures to bystanders, in addition to the targeted pathogen, in measuring the impact of antibiotic resistance interventions.\n\nSignificance StatementThe forces that contribute to changing population prevalence of antibiotic resistance are not well understood. Bystander selection -- the inadvertent pressures imposed by antibiotics on the microbial flora other than the pathogen targeted by treatment -- is hypothesized to be a major factor in the propagation of antibiotic resistance, but its extent has not been characterized. We estimate the proportion of bystander exposures across a range of antibiotics and organisms and describe factors driving variability of these proportions. Impact estimates for antibiotic resistance interventions, including vaccination, are often limited to effects on a target pathogen. However, the reduction of antibiotic treatment for illnesses caused by the target pathogen may have the broader potential to decrease bystander selection pressures for resistance on many other organisms.","10.1073/pnas.1810840115"

Comparing the estimates from the UK Biobank to those from small population-based studies, we illustrated that sufficiently large sample size is essential for genetic architecture discovery in imaging genetics.

Despite the connexin family of gap junction proteins being considered tumor suppressors, we previously found that glioblastoma cancer stem cells (CSCs) express higher levels of Cx46 compared to non-stem tumor cells, and this was necessary and sufficient for CSC maintenance. To develop a Cx46 targeting strategy, we utilized point mutants to disrupt specific functions of Cx46 and found that gap junction coupling was the critical function of Cx46 for CSCs. Based on this finding, we screened a clinically relevant library of small molecules and identified clofazimine as an inhibitor of Cx46-specific cell-cell communication. Clofazimine attenuated proliferation, self-renewal, and tumor growth and synergized with temozolomide to induce apoptosis. These data suggest that combining clofazimine with standard-of-care therapies may target glioblastoma CSCs.

However, the evolutionary forces controlling TE copy number and the extent to which TEs affect phenotypic variation on a genome-wide scale are still unclear. We characterised TE insertion polymorphism and its effects on gene expression in 124 whole genome sequences from a single population of Capsella grandiflora. The frequency of insertions was negatively correlated with distance to genes, as well as density of conserved non-coding elements, suggesting that the negative effects of TEs on gene regulation are important in limiting their abundance. Rare TE variants strongly influence gene expression variation, predominantly through downregulation. In contrast, rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contribute equally to up- and down-regulation, but have a weaker effect. Taken together, these results imply that TEs are a significant contributor to gene expression variation and can be more likely than rare SNPs to cause extreme changes in gene expression.\n\nAuthor SummaryTransposable elements (TEs), mobile DNA elements with the ability to excise from the genome and reinsert in new locations, are important components of genomic diversity. Due to their abundance and mobility, TEs play an influential role in genomic evolution, often deleterious. Here we show that TEs in a population of the plant Capsella grandiflora are most deleterious when they insert in genic and regulatory regions. We find that TEs indeed are associated with unusual levels of gene expression, predominantly decreased expression.\n\nFurthermore, this effect is stronger than the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with gene expression variation, highlighting the importance of TE contribution to the maintenance of expression variation.","10.1093/molbev/msz098"

Among the prime causative factors for the spread of antibiotic resistance is horizontal gene transfer (HGT). A useful model organism for investigating the relationship between HGT and antibiotic resistance is the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis, since the species possesses highly conjugative plasmids that readily disseminate antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors in nature. Unlike many commensal E. faecalis strains, the genomes of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. faecalis clinical isolates are enriched for mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and lack CRISPR-Cas genome defense systems. CRISPR-Cas systems cleave foreign DNA in a programmable, sequence-specific manner and are disadvantageous for MGE-derived genome expansion. An unexplored facet of CRISPR biology in E. faecalis is that MGEs that are targeted by native CRISPR-Cas systems can be transiently maintained. Here, we investigate the basis for this \""CRISPR tolerance.\"" We observe that E. faecalis can maintain self-targeting constructs that direct Cas9 to cleave the chromosome, but at a fitness cost. Interestingly, DNA repair genes were not up-regulated during self-targeting, but integrated prophages were strongly induced. We determined that low cas9 expression contributes to this transient non-lethality and use this knowledge to develop a robust CRISPR-assisted genome editing scheme. Our results suggest that E. faecalis has maximized the potential for DNA acquisition by attenuating its CRISPR machinery, thereby facilitating acquisition of potentially beneficial MGEs that may otherwise be restricted by genome defense.\n\nImportanceCRISPR-Cas has provided a powerful toolkit to manipulate bacteria, resulting in improved genetic manipulations and novel antimicrobials. These powerful applications rely on the premise that CRISPR-Cas chromosome targeting, which leads to double-stranded DNA breaks, is lethal. In this study, we show that chromosomal CRISPR targeting in Enterococcus faecalis is transiently non-lethal. We uncover novel phenotypes associated with this \""CRISPR tolerance\"" and, after determining its genetic basis, develop a genome editing platform in E. faecalis with negligible off-target effects. Our findings reveal a novel strategy exploited by a bacterial pathogen to cope with CRISPR-induced conflicts to more readily accept DNA, and our robust CRISPR editing platform will help simplify genetic modifications in this organism.","10.1128/mBio.00414-18"

The major problem with using radiation to approximate surgery in unresectable disease is that the radiation dose required to ablate pancreatic cancer exceeds the tolerance of the nearby duodenum. WR-2721, also known as amifostine, is a well-known radioprotector, but has significant clinical toxicities when given systemically. WR-2721 is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite, WR-1065, by alkaline phosphatases in normal tissues. The small intestine is highly enriched in these activating enzymes, and thus we reasoned that oral administration of WR-2721 just before radiation would result in localized production of the radioprotective WR-1065 in the small intestine, providing protective benefits without the significant systemic side effects. Here, we show that oral WR-2721 is as effective as intraperitoneal WR-2721 in promoting survival of intestinal crypt clonogens after morbid irradiation. Furthermore, oral WR-2721 confers full radioprotection and survival after lethal upper abdominal irradiation of 12.5Gy x 5 fractions (total of 62.5Gy, D2EQ=140.6Gy), which would likely ablate pancreatic cancer. We find that the efficacy of oral WR-2721 stems from its selective accumulation in the intestine, but not in tumors or other normal tissues, as determined by in vivo mass spectrometry analysis. Thus, we demonstrate that oral WR-2721 is a well-tolerated, and quantitatively selective, radioprotector of the intestinal tract that is capable of enabling clinically relevant ablative doses of radiation to the upper abdomen without unacceptable gastrointestinal toxicity.","10.1038/s41598-018-37147-9"

Mean [18F]AV1451 uptake in the data-driven clusters, and in 35 previously published pathology-driven ROIs, was extracted from ADNI [18F]AV1451 scans. We performed linear models comparing [18F]AV1451 signal across all 40 ROIs to several tests of global cognition, adjusting for age, sex and education. Two data-driven ROIs consistently demonstrated the strongest or near-strongest effect sizes across all cognitive tests. Inputting all regions plus demographics into a feature selection routine resulted in selection of two ROIs (one data-driven, one pathology-driven) and education, which together explained 28% of the variance of a global cognitive composite score.

These five types are defined by distinct but overlapping combinations of proteins and differ in biological and biochemical properties, including transcriptional activity, replication timing and histone modifications. In this work, we assess the evolutionary relationships of chromatin-associated proteins and present an integrated view of the evolution and conservation of the fruit fly D. melanogaster chromatin landscape. We combine homology prediction across a wide range of species with gene age inference methods to determine the origin of each chromatin-associated protein. This provides insight into the emergence of the different chromatin types. Our results indicate that the two euchromatic types, YELLOW and RED, were one single activating type that split early in eukaryotic history. Next, we provide evidence that GREEN-associated proteins are involved in a centromere drive and expanded in a lineage-specific way in D. melanogaster. Our results on BLUE chromatin support the hypothesis that the emergence of Polycomb Group proteins is linked to eukaryotic multicellularity. In light of these results, we discuss how the regulatory complexification of chromatin links to the origins of eukaryotic multicellularity.","10.1093/gbe/evz019"

Exploring a phenomeno-logical reaction-diffusion model, we predict a crucial, and novel, role for cytoplasmic interactions in the large-scale correlations of cell polarities. We demonstrate that finite-range (i.e. nonlocal) cytoplasmic interactions are necessary and sufficient for the robust and long-range polarization of tissues -- even in the absence of global cues -- and are essential to the faithful detection of weak directional signals. Strikingly, our model re-capitulates an observed influence of anisotropic tissue geometries on the orientation of polarity.

A.","Bruce A Hay","Caltech","2018-03-27",1,"2","new results","genetics","A gene drive method of particular interest for population suppression utilizes homing endonuclease genes (HEGs), wherein a site-specific nuclease-encoding cassette is copied, in the germline, into a target gene whose loss of function results in loss of viability or fertility in homozygous, but not heterozygous progeny. Earlier work in Drosophila and mosquitoes utilized HEGs consisting of Cas9 and a single gRNA that together target a specific gene for cleavage. Homing was observed, but resistant alleles, immune to cleavage, while retaining wildtype gene function, were also created through non-homologous end joining. Such alleles prevent drive and population suppression. Targeting a gene for cleavage at multiple positions has been suggested as a strategy to prevent the appearance of resistant alleles. To test this hypothesis, we generated two suppression HEGs, targeting genes required for embryonic viability or fertility, using a HEG consisting of CRISPR/Cas9 and guide RNAs (gRNAs) designed to cleave each gene at four positions. Rates of target locus cleavage were very high, and multiplexing of gRNAs prevented resistant allele formation. However, germline homing rates were modest, and the HEG cassette was unstable during homing events, resulting in frequent partial copying of HEGs that lacked gRNAs, a dominant marker gene, or Cas9. Finally, in drive experiments the HEGs failed to spread, due to the high fitness load induced in offspring as a result of maternal carry over of Cas9/gRNA complex activity. Alternative design principles are proposed that may mitigate these problems in future gene drive engineering.\n\nSignificance statementHEG-based gene drive can bring about population suppression when genes required for viability or fertility are targeted. However, these strategies are vulnerable to failure through mechanisms that create alleles resistant to cleavage, but that retain wildtype gene function. We show that resistance allele creation can be prevented through the use of gRNAs designed to cleave a gene at four target sites. However, homing rates were modest, and the HEGs were unstable during homing. In addition, use of a promoter active in the female germline resulted in levels of HEG carryover that compromised the viability or fertility of HEG-bearing heterozygotes, thereby preventing drive. We propose strategies that can help to overcome these problems in next generation HEG systems.","10.1073/pnas.1805278115"

Most notably, the colonization, peak and collapse of the medieval Norse colony of Greenland have all been attributed to the proto-globalization of ivory trade. Nevertheless, no studies have directly traced European ivory back to distinct populations of walrus in the Arctic. This limits our understanding of how ivory trade impacted the sustainability of northern societies and the ecology of the species they relied on. Here, we compare the mitogenomes of 27 archaeological walrus specimens from Europe and Greenland (most dated between 900 and 1400 CE) and 10 specimens from Svalbard (dated to the 18th and 19th centuries CE) to partial mitochondrial (MT) data of over 300 modern walruses. We discover two monophyletic mitochondrial clades, one of which is exclusively found in walrus populations of western Greenland and the Canadian Arctic. Investigating the chronology of these clades in our European archaeological remains, we identify a significant shift in resource use from predominantly eastern sources towards a near exclusive representation of walruses from western Greenland. These results provide empirical evidence for the economic importance of walrus for the Norse Greenland settlements and the integration of this remote, western Arctic resource into a medieval pan-European trade network.","10.1098/rspb.2018.0978"

This contrasted response is due to allelic variations and is caused by gene-by-environment interactions (GxE). Finding the genes and the cellular functions that interact with the environment is a current challenge for better understanding the genetic bases of phenotypic plasticity. In order to study the impact of natural allelic variations having a contrasted but relevant effect in a changing environment, we investigated the phenotypic response of the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermented in various grape juices. In this study we implemented a QTL mapping program using two independent offspring (~100 progeny) in order to investigate the molecular basis of yeast phenotypic response in a wine fermentation context. Thanks to high throughput sequencing approaches, both populations were genotyped, providing saturated genetic maps of thousands of markers. Linkage analyses allowed the detection of 78 QTLs including 21 with significant interaction with the nature of the fermented juice or fermentation conditions. Molecular dissection of a major QTL showed that the sulfite pump Ssu1p has a pleiotropic effect and impacts the phenotypic plasticity of several traits. Both alleles have positive effect according to external condition in phenotypes related to yeast fitness suggesting an example of balanced selection.

Gene expression of immune cell markers such as CD86, CD163 and PCNA was reduced; however signalling targets associated with resveratrols mechanism of action of action including SIRT1 and NF-{kappa}B were unchanged. In conclusion, low-dose resveratrol was not effective in reducing disease pathology; however, its ability to promote hypertrophy in wildtype skeletal muscle could have direct applications to the livestock industry or in sports medicine.","NA"

To achieve higher production, denser planting will be required on increasingly degraded soils. When grown in dense stands, crops elongate and raise their leaves in an effort to reach sunlight, a process termed shade-avoidance [2]. Shade is perceived by a reduction in the ratio of red (R) to (FR) light and results in the stabilisation of a class of transcription factors known as PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) [3,4]. PIFs activate the expression of auxin biosynthesis genes [4,5] and enhance auxin sensitivity [6], which promotes cell wall loosening and drives elongation growth. Despite our molecular understanding of shade-induced growth, little is known about how this developmental programme is integrated with other environmental factors.\n\nHere we demonstrate that low levels of NaCl in soil strongly impair the ability of plants to respond to shade. This block is dependent upon abscisic acid (ABA) signalling and the canonical ABA signalling pathway. Low R:FR light enhances the expression of a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway, BRASSINOSTEROID SIGNALLING KINASE 5 (BSK5). We found that ABA inhibits BSK5 up-regulation and interferes with GSK3-like kinase inactivation by the BR pathway, thus leading to a suppression of PIF function. By demonstrating a link between the ABA and BR-signalling pathways this study provides an important step forward in our understanding of how environmental cues are integrated into plant development.","10.1016/j.cub.2019.03.042"

However, virtually all ecological communities encompass several trophic guilds, and the trophic interactions between them are key for explaining the persistence and abundance of individual species. Here I ask whether trophic interactions are also important in shaping Species Abundance Distributions of the different guilds of a community. I analyze the variation in SAD shape across trophic guilds in model and empirical communities. For that, I use a theoretical model that allows tracking the variations in abundances across trophic levels. The relationship between SAD shape and (1) trophic level, and (2) degree of predator specialization is analyzed using mixed-effect models. I combine this approach with an analysis of 4676 empirical datasets spanning terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats, for which the variation in SAD shape is related to (1) trophic guild, and (2) habitat type. The evenness of model SADs is positively correlated to the trophic level of the guild considered, and also to the number of prey species per predator. These findings are confirmed by the empirical data: there is a significant relationship between SAD evenness and trophic guild, whereby primary producers display the most uneven SADs and pure carnivores the most even ones. Furthermore, regardless of trophic guild, SADs from marine habitats are the most even ones, with terrestrial SADs being the most uneven.","NA"

Consequently, it is not well established if enhancers operate individually and/or in clusters to coordinate gene transcription. In the current study, we introduce Nodewalk, which uniquely combines high sensitivity with high resolution to enable the analysis of chromatin networks in minute input material. The >10,000-fold increase in sensitivity over other many-to-all competing methods uncovered that active chromatin hubs identified in large input material, corresponding to 10 000 cells, flanking the MYC locus are primarily virtual. Thus, the close agreement between chromatin interactomes generated from aliquots corresponding to less than 10 cells with randomly re-sampled interactomes, we find that numerous distal enhancers positioned within flanking topologically associating domains (TADs) converge on MYC in largely mutually exclusive manners. Moreover, when comparing with several enhancer baits, the assignment of the MYC locus as the node with the highest dynamic importance index, indicates that it is MYC targeting its enhancers, rather than vice versa. Dynamic changes in the configuration of the boundary between TADs flanking MYC underlie numerous stochastic encounters with a diverse set of enhancers to depict the plasticity of its transcriptional regulation. Such an arrangement might increase the fitness of the cancer cell by increasing the probability of MYC transcription in response to a wide range of environmental cues encountered by the cell during the neoplastic process.","NA"

Here, we describe the role of an Axin family member, pry-1, in lipid metabolism. As a central component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, pry-1 acts as a scaffold to multiprotein destruction complex that negatively regulates the expression of Wnt target genes. A genome-wide transcriptome profiling of pry-1 mutant revealed genes associated with aging and lipid metabolism such as vitellogenins (yolk lipoproteins), fatty acid desaturases, lipases, and fatty acid transporters. Consistent with this we found that pry-1 is crucial for the normal adult lifespan and maintenance of lipid levels. Knock-downs of vit genes in pry-1 mutant background restored lipid levels, suggesting that Vitellogenins contribute to PRY-1 function in lipid metabolic processes. Additionally, lowered expression of desaturases and lipidomics analysis provided evidence that the fatty acid synthesis is reduced in pry-1 mutants. In agreement with this an exogenous supply of oleic acid restored depleted lipids in somatic tissues of worms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that PRY-1/Axin signaling is essential for lipid metabolism and involves regulation of yolk proteins.","10.1371/journal.pone.0206540"

The dynamics of these communities is driven by a range of microbial interactions from symbiosis to predator-prey relationships, the majority of which are poorly understood, making it hard to predict the response of the community to different perturbations. With the increasing availability of high-throughput sequencing based community composition data, it is now conceivable to directly learn models that explicitly define microbial interactions and explain community dynamics. The applicability of these approaches is however affected by several experimental limitations, particularly the compositional nature of sequencing data. We present a new computational approach (BEEM) that addresses this key limitation in the inference of generalised Lotka-Volterra models (gLVMs) by coupling biomass estimation and model inference in an expectation maximization like algorithm (BEEM). Surprisingly, BEEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for inferring gLVMs, while simultaneously eliminating the need for additional experimental biomass data as input.

The major problem with using radiation to approximate surgery in unresectable disease is that the radiation dose required to ablate pancreatic cancer exceeds the tolerance of the nearby duodenum. WR-2721, also known as amifostine, is a well-known radioprotector, but has significant clinical toxicities when given systemically. WR-2721 is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite, WR-1065, by alkaline phosphatases in normal tissues. The small intestine is highly enriched in these activating enzymes, and thus we reasoned that oral administration of WR-2721 just before radiation would result in localized production of the radioprotective WR-1065 in the small intestine, providing protective benefits without the significant systemic side effects. Here, we show that oral WR-2721 is as effective as intraperitoneal WR-2721 in promoting survival of intestinal crypt clonogens after morbid irradiation. Furthermore, oral WR-2721 confers full radioprotection and survival after lethal upper abdominal irradiation of 12.5Gy x 5 fractions (total of 62.5Gy, D2EQ=140.6Gy), which would likely ablate pancreatic cancer.

This major difference suggests that the erythroid differentiation process is likely to present both similarities and differences in mammals compared to other vertebrates. Since proteins are the major cellular effectors, analysis of the proteome is more prone to reflect true differences than analysis of the pattern of mRNA expression. We have previously reported the evolution of the proteome of human erythroid cells throughout their differentiation process. Here we report the analysis of the proteome of chicken erythroblasts during their terminal differentiation. We used the T2EC cellular model that allows to obtain homogenous populations of immature erythroblasts. Induction of their terminal differentiation led to their maturation and the possibility to obtain cells at different differentiation stages. Mass spectrometry analysis of these cell populations allowed the absolute quantification of 6167 proteins throughout the terminal differentiation process. Beside many proteins with similar expression patterns between chicken and human erythroblasts, like SLC4A1 (Band3), GATA1 or CD44, this analysis also revealed that other important proteins like Kit or other GATA transcription factors exhibit fully different patterns of expression.","NA"

In rats, cocaine intake was compared when rats were alone with intake when peers with different characteristics (familiar or not, cocaine naive or not, dominant or subordinate) were present. In humans, 77 cocaine and/or methylphenidate users were asked to detail their most recent drug use episodes and their relationship with peers present at consumption. The results show that in both humans and rats, the risk of cocaine/stimulant consumption was significantly reduced by 37% and 32%, respectively, when a peer was present. Moreover, the lowest risk of consumption was consistently observed when the peer was unfamiliar (vs familiar) with a further 38% and 17% risk reduction, respectively. In rats, a decreased risk of consumption was greater when the peer was cocaine naive (vs non-cocaine naive).\n\nThe presence of a non-familiar and possibly drug-naive peer is the most efficient condition to diminish stimulant intake.

Unlike the 19S regulator of the proteasome, which specifically recognizes ubiquitylated proteins, PA28{gamma} promotes the degradation of several substrates by the proteasome in an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent manner. However its exact mechanisms of action are unclear and likely to involve additional partners that remain to be identified. Here we report the identification of the first cofactor of PA28{gamma}, PIP30/FAM192A. PIP30 binds directly and specifically via its C-terminal end and in an interaction stabilized by casein kinase 2 phosphorylation to both free and 20S proteasome-associated PA28{gamma}. Its recruitment to proteasome-containing complexes depends on PA28{gamma} and its expression increases the association of PA28{gamma} with the 20S proteasome in cells. Further dissection of its possible roles shows that PIP30 alters PA28{gamma}-dependent activation of peptide degradation by the 20S proteasome in vitro and negatively controls in cells the presence of PA28{gamma} in Cajal Bodies by inhibition of its association with the key Cajal body component coilin. Altogether, our data show that PIP30 deeply affects PA28{gamma} interactions with cellular proteins, including 20S proteasome, demonstrating that it is an important regulator of PA28{gamma} in cells and thus a new player in the control of the multiple functions of the proteasome within the nucleus.\n\nSignificance StatementThe 20S proteasome is a key actor of the control of protein levels and integrity in cells. To perform its multiple functions, it works with a series of regulators, among which a nuclear complex called PA28{gamma}. In particular, PA28{gamma} participates in the regulation of cell proliferation and nuclear dynamics. We describe here the characterization of a novel protein, PIP30/FAM192A, which binds tightly to PA28{gamma} and favors its interaction with the 20S proteasome while inhibiting its association with coilin, a central component of nuclear Cajal bodies. Thus PIP30/FAM192A critically controls the interactome and consequently the functions of PA28{gamma}, and appears to be a new player in the fine regulation of intracellular proteostasis in the cell nucleus.","10.1073/pnas.1722299115"

Identification of the behavioral strategy used for this control is important for understanding animals decision-making and is fundamental to dissect information processing done by the nervous system. However, methods for quantifying such behavioral strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify an animals behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. As a particular target, we applied this framework to C. elegans thermotactic behavior; after cultivation at a constant temperature with or without food, the fed and starved worms prefer and avoid from the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient, respectively. Our IRL approach revealed that the fed worms used both absolute and temporal derivative of temperature and that their strategy comprised mixture of two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). The DM is a strategy that the worms efficiently reach to specific temperature, which explained thermotactic behaviors of the fed worms. The IM is a strategy that the worms track along a constant temperature, which reflects isothermal tracking well observed in previous studies. We also showed the neural basis underlying the strategies, by applying our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. In contrast to fed animals, the strategy of starved animals indicated that they escaped the cultivation temperature using only absolute, but not temporal derivative of temperature. Thus, our IRL-based approach is capable of identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and will be applicable to wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making of other organisms.\n\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding animal decision-making has been a fundamental problem in neuroscience and behavioral ecology. Many studies analyze actions that represent decision-making in behavioral tasks, in which rewards are artificially designed with specific objectives. However, it is impossible to extend this artificially designed experiment to a natural environment, because in a natural environment, the rewards for freely-behaving animals cannot be clearly defined. To this end, we must reverse the current paradigm so that rewards are identified from behavioral data. Here, we propose a new reverse-engineering approach (inverse reinforcement learning) that can estimate a behavioral strategy from time-series data of freely-behaving animals. By applying this technique with thermotaxis in C. elegans, we successfully identified the reward-based behavioral strategy.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006122"

However, both functional and evolutionary studies of host-virus interaction in Drosophila have been limited by a dearth of native virus isolates. In particular, despite a long history of virus research, DNA viruses of D. melanogaster have only recently been described, and none have been available for experimental study. Here we report the isolation and comprehensive characterisation of Kallithea virus, a large double-stranded DNA virus, and the first DNA virus to have been reported from wild populations of D. melanogaster. We find that Kallithea virus infection is costly for adult flies, reaching high titres in both sexes and disproportionately reducing survival in males and movement and late fecundity in females. Using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, we quantify host genetic variance for virus-induced mortality and viral titre and identify candidate host genes that may underlie this variation, including Cdc42-interacting protein 4. Using full transcriptome sequencing of infected males and females, we examine the transcriptional response of flies to Kallithea virus infection, and describe differential regulation of virus-responsive genes. This work establishes Kallithea virus as a new tractable model to study the natural interaction between D. melanogaster and DNA viruses, and we hope it will serve as a basis for future studies of immune responses to DNA viruses in insects.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model species to study host-virus interaction and innate immunity. However, few natural viruses of Drosophila have been available for experiments, and no natural DNA viruses of Drosophila melanogaster have been available at all. Although infecting flies with viruses from other insects has been useful to uncover general immune mechanisms, viruses that naturally infect wild flies could help us to learn more about the coevolutionary process, and more about the genes that underlie the host-virus interaction. Here we present an isolate of a DNA virus (named Kallithea Virus) that naturally infects the model species Drosophila melanogaster in the wild. We describe the basic biology of infection by this virus, finding that both male and females flies die from infection, but females are more tolerant of infection than males, while laying lay fewer eggs than uninfected females. We quantify genetic variation for virus resistance in the flies, and we use RNA sequencing to see which genes are expressed in male and female flies in response to infection. These results will form the basis for further research to understand how insects defend themselves against infection by DNA viruses, and how DNA viruses can overcome antiviral defence.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007050"

The major problem with using radiation to approximate surgery in unresectable disease is that the radiation dose required to ablate pancreatic cancer exceeds the tolerance of the nearby duodenum. WR-2721, also known as amifostine, is a well-known radioprotector, but has significant clinical toxicities when given systemically. WR-2721 is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite, WR-1065, by alkaline phosphatases in normal tissues. The small intestine is highly enriched in these activating enzymes, and thus we reasoned that oral administration of WR-2721 just before radiation would result in localized production of the radioprotective WR-1065 in the small intestine, providing protective benefits without the significant systemic side effects. Here, we show that oral WR-2721 is as effective as intraperitoneal WR-2721 in promoting survival of intestinal crypt clonogens after morbid irradiation. Furthermore, oral WR-2721 confers full radioprotection and survival after lethal upper abdominal irradiation of 12.5Gy x 5 fractions (total of 62.5Gy, D2EQ=140.6Gy), which would likely ablate pancreatic cancer.

Then we empirically tested the GCTA and LDAK Models on GWAS data for a wide variety of complex traits. We found that the LDAK Model fits real data both significantly and substantially better than the GCTA Model, indicating that LDAK estimates more accurately describe the genetic architecture of complex traits than those from GCTA or LDSC.\n\nSome of our most striking results were our revised estimates of functional enrichments (the heritability enrichments of SNP categories defined by functional annotations). In general, estimates from LDAK were substantially more modest than previous estimates based on the GCTA Model. For example, we estimated that DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) were 1.4-fold (SD 0.1) enriched, whereas a study using GCTA had found they were 5.1-fold (SD 0.5) enriched,5 and we estimated that conserved SNPs were 1.3-fold (SD 0.3) enriched, whereas a study using S-LDSC (stratified LDSC) had found they were 13.3-fold (SD 1.5) enriched.6\n\nIn their correspondence, Gazal et al. dispute our findings.

One popular approach to identify de novo genes is phylostratigraphy, which consists of determining the approximate time of origin (age) of a gene based on its distribution along a species phylogeny. Several studies have revealed significant flaws in determining the age of genes, including de novo genes, using phylostratigraphy alone. However, the rate of false positives in de novo gene surveys, based on phylostratigraphy, remains unknown. Here, I re-analyze the findings from three studies, two of which identified tens to hundreds of rodent-specific de novo genes adopting a phylostratigraphy-centered approach. Most of the putative de novo genes discovered in these investigations are no longer included in recently updated mouse gene sets. Using a combination of synteny information and sequence similarity searches, I show that about 60% of the remaining 381 putative de novo genes share homology with genes from other vertebrates, originated through gene duplication, and/or share no synteny information with non-rodent mammals. These results led to an estimated rate of [~]12 de novo genes per million year in mouse. Contrary to a previous study (Wilson et al. 2017), I found no evidence supporting the preadaptation hypothesis of de novo gene formation.

Spatially-explicit models of ecosystems suggest that loss of such power-law clustering may indicate loss of ecosystem resilience. Hence, it is hypothesised that spatial clustering properties in ecosystems - which can be readily measured using remotely-sensed high-resolution data - can help infer proximity to ecosystem thresholds and may even provide early warning signals of ecosystem collapse. Recent empirical and simulation studies, however, dont find consistent relationships between spatial clustering and ecosystem resilience. Furthermore, how spatial clustering metrics relate to other well-known early warning signals of ecosystems collapse, specifically the phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD), remains unclear.
C_LIO_LIWe synthesize the literature on cluster sizes in empirical and theoretical studies that show how local interactions (especially, positive feedback) among organisms can cause power-law clustering. In addition, we analyse a minimal spatial model of ecosystem transitions that allows us to disentangle the role of environmental stressor and positive feedback on spatial patterns and ecosystem resilience.
C_LIO_LIOur literature synthesis reveals that empirically observed power-law clustering in ecosystems is parsimoniously explained by local positive feedback. Our synthesis together with model analysis demonstrates that, depending on the strength of positive feedback, emergence of power-law clustering can occur at any distance from the critical threshold of ecosystem collapse. In fact, we find that for systems with strong positive feedbacks, which are most likely to exhibit abrupt transitions, loss of power-law clustering may not even occur prior to ecosystem thresholds. We also argue that cluster-size distributions are unrelated to the phenomenon of CSD.
C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that, due to CSD, a power-law feature does occur near critical thresholds but in a different quantity; specifically, a power-law decay of spatial correlations of ecosystem state.
C_LIO_LIWe conclude that loss of power-law clustering cannot be used as a reliable indicator of ecosystem resilience. Our synthesis and model analyses highlights links between local positive feedback, emergent spatial properties and how they may be used to interpret ecosystem resilience.

This paper proposes dynamic graphical models (DGMs) for dynamic, directed functional connectivity. DGMs are a multivariate graphical model with time-varying coefficients that describe instantaneous directed relationships between nodes. A further benefit of DGMs is that networks may contain loops and that large networks can be estimated. We use network simulations, human resting-state fMRI (N = 500) to investigate the validity and reliability of the estimated networks. We simulate systematic lags of the hemodynamic response at different brain regions to investigate how these lags potentially bias directionality estimates. In the presence of such lag confounds (0.4-0.8 seconds offset between connected nodes), our method has a sensitivity of 72%-77% to detect the true direction. Stronger lag confounds have reduced sensitivity, but do not increase false positives (i.e., directionality estimates of the opposite direction). In human resting-state fMRI, we find the DMN has consistent influence on the cerebellar, the limbic and the auditory/temporal network, as well a consistent reciprocal relationship between the visual medial and visual lateral network. Finally, we apply the method in a small mouse fMRI sample and discover a highly plausible relationship between areas in the hippocampus feeding into the cingulate cortex.

It is currently thought that such sophisticated control is computed within a transcortical feedback pathway. Here we show that even the fastest spinal feedback pathway can produce corrective responses that adhere to this control scheme. We first applied small mechanical perturbations that flexed the elbow joint - stretching the triceps muscle - and simultaneously flexed or extended the wrist joint, displacing the hand various distances away from a central target. We then changed the arms orientation and applied the same joint perturbations, which reversed the mapping between joint motion and hand displacement. In all cases, we found that the triceps spinal stretch reflex was tuned to the hands displacement relative to the target, and not how the triceps muscle was stretched.

Here we implemented a CRISPRi-mediated genome-wide screen and identified SLC37A3 (solute carrier family 37 member A3) as a gene required for the action of N-BPs. We observed that SLC37A3 forms a complex with ATRAID (all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation factor), a previously identified genetic target of N-BPs. SLC37A3 and ATRAID localize to lysosomes and are required for releasing N-BP molecules that have trafficked to lysosomes through fluid-phase endocytosis into the cytosol.

However, little is known about the use of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) by this consortium of microbes.\n\nRESULTSA feeding study using deuterated TMAO in C57BL6/J mice demonstrated microbial conversion of TMAO to TMA, with uptake of TMA into the bloodstream and its conversion to TMAO. Microbial activity necessary to convert TMAO to TMA was suppressed in antibiotic-treated mice, with deuterated TMAO being taken up directly into the bloodstream. In batch-culture fermentation systems inoculated with human faeces, growth of Enterobacteriaceae was stimulated in the presence of TMAO. Human-derived faecal and caecal bacteria (n = 66 isolates) were screened on solid and liquid media for their ability to use TMAO, with metabolites in spent media analysed by 1H-NMR. As with the in vitro fermentation experiments, TMAO stimulated the growth of Enterobacteriaceae; these bacteria produced most TMA from TMAO. Caecal/small intestinal isolates of Escherichia coli produced more TMA from TMAO than their faecal counterparts. Lactic acid bacteria produced increased amounts of lactate when grown in the presence of TMAO, but did not produce large amounts of TMA. Clostridia (sensu stricto), bifidobacteria and coriobacteria were significantly correlated with TMA production in the mixed fermentation system but did not produce notable quantities of TMA from TMAO in pure culture.\n\nCONCLUSIONSReduction of TMAO by the gut microbiota (predominantly Enterobacteriaceae) to TMA followed by host uptake of TMA into the bloodstream from the intestine and its conversion back to TMAO by host hepatic enzymes is an example of metabolic retroconversion. TMAO influences microbial metabolism depending on isolation source and taxon of gut bacterium.\n\nCorrelation of metabolomic and abundance data from mixed microbiota fermentation systems did not give a true picture of which members of the gut microbiota were responsible for converting TMAO to TMA; only by supplementing the study with pure culture work and additional metabolomics was it possible to increase our understanding of TMAO bioconversions by the human gut microbiota.","10.1186/s40168-018-0461-0"

Some data, however, seem to contradict this hypothesis, showing that the difference is still observed when the role of IRT reinforcement is neutralized by using a regulated-probability interval schedule (RPI). Given the mixed evidence for these predictions, we re-examined this hypothesis by training three groups of rats to lever press under ratio, interval and RPI schedules across two phases while matching reward rates within triads. At the end of the first phase, the master ratio and RPI groups responded at similar rates. In the second phase, an interval group yoked to the same master ratio group of the first phase responded at a lower rate than the RPI group. Post-hoc analysis showed comparable reward rates for master and yoked schedules. The experienced response-outcome rate correlations were likewise similar, and approached zero as training progressed.

Here, we have elucidated that topovectorial mechanisms control the juxtamembrane processing of Nrf1 on the cyto/nucleoplasmic side of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereupon it is cleaved and degraded to remove various lengths of its N-terminal domain (NTD, also refold into a UBL module) and acidic domain-1 (AD1) to yield multiple isoforms. Notably, an N-terminal [~]12.5-kDa polypeptide of Nrf1 arises from selective cleavage at an NHB2-adjoining region within NTD, whilst other longer UBL-containing isoforms may arise from proteolytic processing of the protein within AD1 around PEST1 and Neh2L degrons. The susceptibility of Nrf1 to proteolysis is determined by dynamic repositioning of potential UBL-adjacent degrons and cleavage sites from the ER lumen through p97-driven retrotranslocation and -independent pathways into the cyto/nucleoplasm. These repositioned degrons and cleavage sites within NTD and AD1 of Nrf1 are coming into their bona fide functionality, thereby enabling it to be selectively processed by cytosolic DDI-1/2 proteases and also degraded via 26S proteasomes. The resultant proteolytic processing of Nrf1 gives rise to a mature [~]85-kDa CNC-bZIP transcription factor, which regulates transcriptional expression of cognate target genes. Furthermore, putative ubiquitination of Nrf1 is not a prerequisite necessary for involvement of p97 in the client processing. Overall, the regulated juxtamembrane proteolysis (RJP) of Nrf1, though occurring in close proximity to the ER, is distinctive from the mechanism that regulates the intramembrane proteolytic (RIP) processing of ATF6 and SREBP1.","10.1016/j.taap.2018.09.039"

However, excessive inflammasome activation damages the hosts, and thus it must be precisely controlled. The mechanism underlying the repression of systematic inflammasome activation remains largely unknown. This study reveals that CUL1, a key component of the SCF E3 ligase, plays a critical role in regulation of the inflammasome. CUL1 suppresses the inflammasome activation in HEK293T cells, inhibits endogenous NLRP3 in macrophages, and represses inflammatory responses in C57BL/6 mice. Under normal physiological conditions, CUL1 interacts with NLRP3 to disrupt the inflammasome assembly, and catalyzes NLRP3 ubiquitination to repress the inflammasome activation. In response to inflammatory stimuli, CUL1 disassociates from NLRP3 to release the repression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This work reveals a distinct mechanism underlying the repression of inflammasome activation under physiological conditions and the induction of inflammasome activation in response to inflammatory stimuli, and thus provides insights into the prevention and treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases.","NA"

Unfortunately, these approaches create substantial mechanical lesions of the tissue precipitating neuropathological responses that include inflammation and gliosis. Together, lesions and the associated neuropathology may compromise neural circuit performance.

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of SIM in the model freshwater teleost zebrafish (Danio rerio) following a chronic exposure (90 days) to environmentally relevant concentrations ranging from 8 ng/L to 1000 ng/L. This study used a multi-parametric approach integrating distinct ecological-relevant endpoints, i.e. survival, growth, reproduction and embryonic development, with biochemical markers (cholesterol and triglycerides). Furthermore, Real Time PCR was used to analyse the transcription levels of key genes involved in the mevalonate pathway (hmgcra, cyp51, and dhcr7). Globally, SIM induced several non-monotonic dose-responses; embryonic development, biochemical and molecular markers, were significantly impacted in the low-intermediate concentrations, 40 ng/L and 200 ng/L, whereas no effects were recorded for the highest tested SIM levels (1000 ng/L). Taken together, these findings expand our understanding of statins effects in teleosts, demonstrating significant impacts at environmentally relevant concentrations.

Recent studies have shown the importance of autocrine-mediated feedback of cell-secreted signals and the interplay between matrix architecture and biochemical diffusion on hematopoietic stem cell activity. Autocrine and paracrine signaling from HSCs and niche-associated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have both been suggested to support HSC maintenance in vivo and in vitro. Here we report the development of a library of methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin (GelMA) hydrogels to explore the balance between autocrine feedback and paracrine signals from co-encapsulated murine bone marrow MSCs on murine HSCs. The use of a degradable GelMA hydrogel enables the possibility for significant MSC-mediated remodeling, yielding dynamic shifts in the matrix environment surrounding HSCs. We identify a combination of an initially low-diffusivity hydrogel and a 1:1 HSPC:MSC seeding ratio as conducive to enhanced HSC population maintenance and quiescence. Further, gene expression and serial mechanical testing data suggests that MSC-mediated matrix remodeling is significant for the long-term HSC culture, reducing HSC autocrine feedback and potentially enhancing MSC-mediated signaling over 7-day culture in vitro. This work demonstrates the design of an HSC culture system that couples initial hydrogel properties, MSC co-culture, and concepts of dynamic reciprocity mediated by MSC remodeling to achieve enhanced HSC maintenance.

Here we evaluate the split-GFP system for visualizing organelle contact sites in vivo and show its advantages and disadvantages. We observed punctate GFP signals from the split-GFP fragments targeted to any pairs of organelles among the ER, mitochondria, peroxisomes, vacuole and lipid droplets in yeast cells, which suggests that these organelles form contact sites with multiple organelles simultaneously although it is difficult to rule out the possibilities that these organelle contacts sites are artificially formed by the irreversible associations of the split-GFP probes. Importantly, split-GFP signals in the overlapped regions of the ER and mitochondria were mainly co-localized with ERMES, an authentic ER-mitochondria tethering structure, suggesting that split-GFP assembly depends on the preexisting inter-organelle contact sites. We also confirmed that the split-GFP system can be applied to detection of the ER-mitochondria contact sites in HeLa cells. We thus propose that the split-GFP system is a potential tool to observe and analyze inter-organelle contact sites in living yeast and mammalian cells.","10.1038/s41598-018-24466-0"

Santangelo","University of Toronto","2018-03-27",1,"1","new results","evolutionary biology","Urban environments offer the opportunity to study the role of adaptive and non-adaptive evolutionary processes on an unprecedented scale. While the presence of parallel clines in heritable phenotypic traits is often considered strong evidence for the role of natural selection, non-adaptive evolutionary processes can also generate clines, and this may be more likely when traits have a non-additive genetic basis due to epistasis. In this paper, we use spatially-explicit simulations modelled according to the cyanogenesis (HCN) polymorphism in white clover (Trifolium repens) to examine the formation of phenotypic clines along urbanization gradients under varying levels of drift, gene flow and selection. HCN results from an epistatic interaction between two Mendelian-inherited loci. Our results demonstrate that the genetic architecture of this trait makes natural populations susceptible to decreases in HCN frequencies via drift. Gradients in the strength of drift across a landscape resulted in phenotypic clines with lower frequencies of HCN in strongly drifting populations, giving the misleading appearance of deterministic adaptive changes in the phenotype. Studies of heritable phenotypic change in urban populations should generate null models of phenotypic evolution based on the genetic architecture underlying focal traits prior to invoking selections role in generating adaptive differentiation.","10.1098/rspb.2018.0230"

Because viruses use the host machinery to replicate, their performance depends on the host physiological state. For bacteriophages, this host-viral performance link has been characterized empirically and with intracellular theories. Such theories are too detailed to be included in models that study host-phage interactions in the long term, which hinders our understanding of systems that range from pathogens infecting gut bacteria to marine phage shaping present and future oceans. Here, we combined data and models to study the short- and long-term consequences that host physiology has on bacteriophage performance. We compiled data showing the dependence of lytic-phage traits on host growth rate (viral phenotypic \""plasticity\"") to deduce simple expressions representing such plasticity. We included these expressions in a standard host-phage model, to understand how viral plasticity can break the expected evolutionary trade-off between infection time and viral offspring number. Furthermore, viral plasticity influences dramatically dynamic scenarios (e.g. sudden nutrient pulses or host starvation). We show that the effect of plasticity on offspring number, not generation time, drives the phage ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Standard models do not account for this plasticity, which handicaps their predictability in realistic environments. Our results highlight the importance of viral plasticity to unravel host-phage interactions, and the need of laboratory and field experiments to characterize viral plastic responses across systems.","10.1086/701668"

The relative abundance of Nitrospira gradually decreased with increasing DO until it was washed out. Nitritation was sustained even after the DO was lowered subsequently. Based on 3D-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) image analysis, the morphologies of AOB and NOB microcolonies responded to DO levels in accordance with their apparent oxygen half saturation constant Ks(app). When exposed to the same oxygenation level, NOB formed densely packed spherical clusters with a low surface area-to-volume ratio compared to the Nitrosomonas-like AOB clusters, which maintained a porous and non-spherical morphology. Microcolony morphology is thus a way for AOB and NOB to regulate oxygen exposure and sustain the mutualistic interaction. However, short-term high DO exposure can select for AOB and against NOB in full-scale domestic WWTPs and such population dynamics depend on which specific AOB and NOB species predominate under given environmental conditions.","NA"

Because all proteins ultimately evolved from previously non-coding DNA, the properties of these non-coding sequences and how they shape the birth of novel proteins are also expected to influence the organization of biological networks. When trying to explain and predict the properties of novel proteins, it is of particular importance to distinguish the contributions of natural selection and other evolutionary forces. Studies in the field typically use non-coding DNA and GC-content-based random-sequence models to generate random expectations for the properties of novel functional proteins. Deviations from these expectations have been interpreted as the result of natural selection. However, interpreting such deviations requires a yet-unattained understanding of the raw material of de novo gene birth and its relation to novel functional proteins. We mathematically show how the importance of the \""junk\"" polypeptides that make up this raw material goes beyond their average properties and their filtering by natural selection. We find that the mean of any property among novel functional proteins also depends on its variance among junk polypeptides and its correlation with their rate of evolutionary turnover. In order to exemplify the use of our general theoretical results, we combine them with a simple model that predicts the means and variances of the properties of junk polypeptides from the genomic GC content alone. Under this model, we predict the effect of GC content on the mean length and mean intrinsic disorder of novel functional proteins as a function of evolutionary parameters. We use these predictions to formulate new evolutionary interpretations of published data on the length and intrinsic disorder of novel functional proteins. This work provides a theoretical framework that can serve as a guide for the prediction and interpretation of past and future results in the study of novel proteins and their properties under various evolutionary models. Our results provide the foundation for a better understanding of the properties of cellular networks through the evolutionary origin of their components.","NA"

Here, we examine the hypothesis that hominin hybrid offspring suffered a reduction in fertility by comparing patterns of sequence divergence of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from numerous hybridising pairs of mammals. Our results reveal a threshold separating species pairs whose divergence values fall within two categories: those whose hybrid offspring can successfully reproduce without backcrossing with their parent species, and those whose hybrid offspring cannot.

Obtaining cyanobacterial DNA without contaminant sequences is thus a challenging and time-consuming task. Here, we deploy a metagenomic pipeline that enables the easy recovery of high-quality genomes from non-axenic cultures. We tested this pipeline on 17 cyanobacterial cultures from the BCCM/ULC public collection and generated novel genome sequences for 15 arctic or subarctic strains, of which 14 early-branching organisms that will be useful for cyanobacterial phylogenomics.

We determined that gene expression in cultured cardiomyocytes from both human and chimpanzee is most similar to that of adult hearts compared to other adult tissues.

Establishing experimental evidence for this information flow within cortical hierarchy has been difficult, especially in humans, due to spatial and temporal limitations of non-invasive measures of cortical activity. This study investigated cortical responses to auditory novelty using the local/global deviant paradigm, which engages the hierarchical network underlying auditory predictive coding over short ( local deviance; LD) and long ( global deviance; GD) time scales. Electrocorticographic responses to auditory stimuli were obtained in neurosurgical patients from regions of interest (ROIs) including auditory, auditory-related and prefrontal cortex. LD and GD effects were assayed in averaged evoked potential (AEP) and high gamma (70-150 Hz) signals, the former likely dominated by local synaptic currents and the latter largely reflecting local spiking activity. AEP LD effects were distributed across all ROIs, with greatest percentage of significant sites in core and non-core auditory cortex. High gamma LD effects were localized primarily to auditory cortex in the superior temporal plane and on the lateral surface of the superior temporal gyrus (STG). LD effects exhibited progressively longer latencies in core, non-core, auditory-related and prefrontal cortices, consistent with feedforward signaling. The spatial distribution of AEP GD effects overlapped that of LD effects, but high gamma GD effects were more restricted to non-core areas. High gamma GD effects had shortest latencies in STG and preceded AEP GD effects in most ROIs. This latency profile, along with the paucity of high gamma GD effects in the superior temporal plane, suggest that the STG plays a prominent role in initiating novelty detection signals over long time scales. Thus, the data demonstrate distinct patterns of information flow in human cortex associated with auditory novelty detection over multiple time scales.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.08.027"

Users can also sample documents using different strategies to obtain a more manageable dataset for further analysis. Adjutant makes explicit trade-offs between speed and accuracy, which are modifiable by the user, such that a complete analysis of several thousand documents can take a few minutes. All analytic datasets generated by Adjutant are saved, allowing users to easily conduct other downstream analyses that Adjutant does not explicitly support.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationAdjutant is implemented in R, using Shiny, and is available at https://github.com/amcrisan/Adjutant","10.1093/bioinformatics/bty722"

In this study, we apply computational tools to The Cancer Genome Atlas and other datasets to define how virus infection shapes the tumor microenvironment and genetic architecture of 6 virus-associated tumor types. Across cancers, the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment varied based on viral status, with infected tumors often exhibiting increased infiltration of cytolytic cell types. Analyses of the infiltrating T cell receptor repertoire revealed that Epstein-Barr virus was associated with decreased diversity in multiple cancers, suggesting an antigen-driven immune response. Tissue-specific gene expression signatures capturing these virus-induced transcriptomic changes successfully predicted virus status in independent datasets and were associated with both immune- and proliferation-related features that were predictive of prognosis. The analyses presented suggest viruses have distinct effects in different tumors with implications for immunotherapy.","10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-1342"

PA14 mutants deficient for NO production fail to elicit avoidance and NO donors repel worms. PA14 and NO avoidance are mediated by the ASJ chemosensory neurons, which respond to NO with intracellular calcium rises. PA14 avoidance and NO-evoked calcium responses require receptor guanylate cyclases (DAF-11 and GCY-27), and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels (TAX-2 and -4). ASJ exhibits calcium increases at both the onset and removal of NO. These NO-evoked ON and OFF calcium transients are affected by a redox sensing protein, TRX-1/thioredoxin. TRX-1s trans-nitrosylation activity inhibits the ON transient whereas TRX-1s de-nitrosylation activity promotes the OFF transient. Thus, C. elegans exploits bacterially produced NO as a cue to mediate avoidance and TRX-1 functions as an NO-sensor that endows ASJ with a bi-phasic response to NO exposure.","10.7554/eLife.36833"

In contrast to the sessile state in the biofilm, various bacterial cells employ flagellum-dependent motility under planktonic conditions suggesting that the two phenotypes are mutually exclusive. However, flagellum dependent motility facilitates the prompt establishment of floating biofilms on the air-medium interface, called pellicles. Previously, pellicles of B. subtilis were shown to be preferably established by motile cells, causing a reduced fitness of non-motile derivatives in the presence of the wild type strain. Here, we show that lack of fully assembled flagella promotes the evolution of matrix overproducers that can be distinguished by the characteristic wrinkled colony morphotype. The wrinkly phenotype is associated with amino acid substitutions in the master repressor of biofilm-related genes, SinR. By analyzing one of the mutations, we show that it alters the tetramerization and DNA binding properties of SinR, allowing an increased expression of the operon responsible for exopolysaccharide production. Finally, we demonstrate that the wrinkly phenotype is advantageous when cells lack flagella, but not in the wild type background.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=194 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/288951v1_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a70c4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e16453org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@819999org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8b2bde_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Abbreviated SummaryDuring biofilm establishment at the air-liquid interface, Bacillus subtilis evolves matrix overproducers with a wrinkly colony phenotype (WS).

We observed an inverted U-shaped curve on priming magnitude when conducting the MOT task concurrently with prime sentences (i.e., memory encoding), but no effect when conducted with target sentences (i.e., memory retrieval).

The current study uses a cross-sectional study design to examine whether regional cortical thickness mediates the relationship between age and episodic memory, as measured by a context memory task for faces. Mediation and conditional mediation models were tested using bootstrapping in order to determine how age-associated changes in regional cortical thickness mediated age-associated changes in performance on the context memory task. We observed that right superior frontal cortical thickness conditionally mediated spatial context memory only in middle-aged and older adults; and right caudal middle frontal cortical thickness conditionally mediated context memory only in older adults. Left lingual cortical thickness mediated spatial context memory across the adult lifespan, but this effect was most evident at midlife. Right parahippocampal cortical thickness mediated context memory, independent of age.

Traditional peptide identification algorithms perform well when identifying unmodified peptides. However, when peptides have post-translational modifications (PTMs), these methods cannot provide satisfactory results. Recently, Chick et al., 2015 and Yu et al., 2016 proposed the spectrum-based and tag-based open search methods, respectively, to identify peptides with PTMs. While the performance of these two methods is promising, the identification results vary greatly with respect to the quality of tandem mass spectra and the number of PTMs in peptides. This motivates us to systematically study the relationship between the performance of open search methods and quality parameters of tandem mass spectrum data, as well as the number of PTMs in peptides.\n\nResultsThrough large-scale simulations, we obtain the performance trend when simulated tandem mass spectra are of different quality. We propose an analytical model to describe the relationship between the probability of obtaining correct identifications and the spectrum quality as well as the number of PTMs. Based on the analytical model, we can quantitatively describe the necessary condition to effectively apply open search methods.\n\nAvailabilitySource codes of the simulation are available at http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/PST.html.\n\nContactboningli@ust.hk or eeyu@ust.hk\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","NA"

Biparental crosses with 12 increasing inoculum concentrations, in controlled conditions, showed that sexual reproduction in Z. tritici was impacted by an Allee effect due to mate limitation and a competition with asexual multiplication for resource allocation. We found that asexual multiplication was itself affected by competition for host resources between the two parental isolates, as illustrated by the decrease in asexual fruiting body density and sporulation intensity observed with increasing lesion density. Consistent with these results for controlled co-inoculation, we found that the intensity of sexual reproduction varied with both cropping period and the vertical position of the host tissues in the field. An optimal lesion density maximizing offspring (ascospores) number was established, and its eco-evolutionary consequences are considered here. Two ecological mechanisms may be involved: competition for resources between the two modes of reproduction (decrease in the host resources available for sexual reproduction due to their prior use in asexual multiplication), and competitive disequilibrium between the two parental isolates, due to differential interaction dynamics with the host, for example, leading to an imbalance between mating types. Conceptual models based on these results suggest that sexual reproduction plays a key role in the evolution of pathogenicity traits, including virulence and aggressiveness. Ecological knowledge about the determinants of sexual reproduction in Z. tritici may, therefore, open up new perspectives for the management of other fungal foliar pathogens with dual modes of reproduction.","10.1007/s00248-018-1211-3"

This limitation exists due to the rich dynamics displayed by thalamocortical networks and because of inadequate tools to characterize those dynamics. Here, we introduce a novel estimator of mutual information and use it to determine the impact of a computational model of thalamic state on information transmission. Using several criteria, this novel estimator, which uses an adaptive partition, is shown to be superior to other mutual information estimators with uniform partitions when used to analyze simulated spike train data with different mean spike rates, as well as electrophysiological data from simultaneously recorded neurons. When applied to a thalamocortical model, the estimator revealed that thalamocortical cell T-type calcium current conductance influences mutual information between the input and output from this network. In particular, a T-type calcium current conductance of about 40 nS appears to produce maximal mutual information between the input to this network (conceptualized as afferent input to the thalamocortical cell) and the output of the network at the level of a layer 4 cortical neuron. Furthermore, at particular combinations of inputs to thalamocortical and thalamic reticular nucleus cells, thalamic cell bursting correlated strongly with recovery of mutual information between thalamic afferents and layer 4 neurons. These studies suggest that the novel mutual information estimator has advantages over previous estimators, and that thalamic reticular nucleus activity can enhance mutual information between thalamic afferents and thalamorecipient cells in the cortex.","10.1152/jn.00012.2018"

Genetically tractable model organisms facilitate mechanistic explanations of learning that span genetic, neural circuit, and behavioural levels. Many aspects of neural physiology, including processes that underlie learning (e.g. neurotransmitter release and long-lasting changes in synaptic strength), are regulated by brief and local changes in [m] levels of free intracellular Ca2+. On this scale, changes in [Ca2+] activate many Ca2+-sensors, including the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs). Here we reveal that the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of CaMK1/4, CMK-1, functions in primary sensory neurons to regulate responses to mechanical stimuli and behavioral plasticity, specifically habituation, a conserved form of non-associative learning. The habituation phenotypes of cmk-1 mutants were dependent on interstimulus interval (ISI), such that CMK-1 slows habituation at short ISIs, but promotes it at long ISIs. We predicted potential CaMK phosphorylation targets from catalytic site analysis of the human and C. elegans CaMKs and mutant analysis of these candidates implicated O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase, OGT-1, in mechanosensitivity and learning. Cell specific rescue and knockdown experiments showed that both CMK-1 and OGT-1 function cell autonomously in mechanosensory neurons to modulate learning.

By manipulating microtubule stability and Cohesin complex integrity in cell lines with varying sensitivity to cohesion fatigue, we show that rates of cohesion fatigue reflect a dynamic balance between spindle pulling forces and resistance to separation by interchromatid cohesion. Cohesion fatigue that results in complete chromatid separation may be an unrecognized but common source of chromosome instability.

This exchange can produce altered evolutionary patterns, including concerted evolution where within genome repeat copies are more similar to each other than to orthologous repeats in related species. Here we investigated the genetic architecture of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) gene family, KRTAP1. This family encodes proteins that are important components of hair and wool in mammals, and the genes are present in tandem copies. Comparison of KRTAP1 gene repeats from species across the mammalian phylogeny shows strongly contrasting evolutionary patterns between the coding regions, which have a concerted evolution pattern, and the flanking regions, which have a normal, radiating pattern of evolution. This dichotomy in evolutionary pattern transitions abruptly at the start and stop codons, and we show it is not the result of purifying selection acting to maintain species-specific protein sequences, nor of codon adaptation or reverse transcription of KRTAP1-n mRNA. Instead, the results are consistent with short-tract gene conversion events coupled with selection for these events in the coding region driving the contrasting evolutionary patterns found in the KRTAP1 repeats. Our work shows the power that repeat recombination has to complement selection and finely tune the sequences of repetitive genes. Interplay between selection and recombination may be a more common mechanism than currently appreciated for achieving specific adaptive outcomes in the many eukaryotic multi-gene families, and our work argues for greater emphasis on exploring the sequence structures of these families.","10.1016/j.ympev.2018.12.031"

Genes generating larger numbers of distinct transcripts and with higher probability of having missense mutations in normal individuals were significantly more likely to cause neurological diseases. Using mouse-mutant phenotypic data we tested the accuracy of gene-phenotype predictions and found that for 88% of all disease subtypes there was a significant enrichment of relevant phenotypic abnormalities when predicted genes were mutated in mice and in many cases mutations produced specific and matching phenotypes. Furthermore, using only newly identified genes included in the Genomics England November 2017 release, we assessed our gene-phenotype predictions and showed an 8.3 fold enrichment relative to chance for correct predictions. Thus, we demonstrate both the explanatory and predictive power of machine-learning-based models in neurological disease.","NA"

Using a two-plasmid reporter system in Escherichia coli, we investigated the regulatory protein component (MtlR) of the mannitol operon from Pseudomonas fluorescens. Our findings suggest that the promoter of mtlE is activated by MtlR in the presence of a variety of sugar inducer molecules, and may exhibit cross-activity with a native regulator of E. coli. Additionally, we engineered the L-arabinose transcriptional activator (AraC) of E. coli for altered ligand specificity. We performed site-specific saturation mutagenesis to generate AraC variants with altered effector specificity, with an aim to generate a mutant activated by xylulose. We characterized several mutant AraC variants which have lost the ability to respond specifically to the native L-arabinose effector. We promote this technique as a powerful tool for future iGEM teams to create regulatory circuits activated by novel small molecule ligands.","NA"

These responses can vary among species from sublethal to lethal effects, which can have consequences for the host population trajectories within a community. Chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (or Bd), has been associated with global amphibian population declines. However, it also occurs in populations without appearing to cause mass mortality; the effect of Bd in these situations is not well understood and environmental factors like food abundance that impact host conditions could play an important role in the magnitude of the pathogens impact. In the present study, we exposed American toad (Anaxyrus americanus), northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens), and Blanchards cricket frog (Acris blanchardi) metamorphs to Bd and then reared them in the terrestrial habitat under low or high food environments. We found additive effects of Bd and reduced food abundance on host growth and survival that varied according to species. For instance, Bd-induced reductions in American toad survival were greater under low food conditions compared to high food conditions but survival of northern leopard frogs and Blanchards cricket frogs was not affected by Bd. For northern leopard frogs and Blanchards cricket frogs, low food abundance resulted in the lower growth rates under Bd exposure compared to high food abundance. Additionally, we developed stage-structured population models for American toads to assess if reduced survival of metamorphs exposed to Bd under conditions of low and high food abundance could influence population trajectories; models indicated that Bd exposure would reduce annual population growth rates by 14% under conditions of high food abundance and 21% under conditions of low food abundance. Our results suggest that environmental conditions that influence resource availability for species that are sensitive or tolerant to Bd may increase the negative effects of Bd on host growth and survival, which could have important implications for how populations and communities with infected members respond over time.","NA"

Super-resolution microscopy revealed that Hv1 forms asymmetrically positioned bilaterally distributed longitudinal lines that span the entire length of the sperm tail. Such a distribution provides a direct structural basis for the selective activation of CatSper, and subsequent flagellar rotation along the long axis that, together with hyperactivated motility, enhances sperm fertility.

Environmental conditions may influence these tradeoffs by affecting size of hosts, or tradeoffs may change across seasons, thereby altering the impacts of diseases on hosts. In the present study, we exposed northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens) tadpoles to varying larval environments (low leaf litter, high density of conspecifics, 40 {micro}g/L atrazine, caged fish, or control) that influenced size at metamorphosis, a measure of host quality. Subsequently, we exposed these metamorphs of to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungal pathogen linked to worldwide host population declines, at metamorphosis and/or 12 weeks later, prior to overwintering. Bd exposure dramatically reduced survival during overwintering and the effect was strongest when frogs were exposed both at metamorphosis and before overwintering. Larval environments, which determined host size, did not influence effects of Bd. Stage-structured models built to assess the impacts of Bd exposure on host populations suggest that Bd exposure at metamorphosis or before overwintering would reduce annual population growth rates by an average of 19% and 41%, respectively. Our study indicates that northern leopard frog hosts suffered little effects of Bd exposures following metamorphosis and that lower host quality did not hamper a frogs ability to respond to Bd. Instead, we provide evidence that Bd exposure can reduce survival and result in population size reductions via reduced recruitment from overwintering mortality, providing a plausible mechanism for enigmatic declines of amphibians in temperate regions.","NA"

Statistical methods for their inference under the multispecies coalescent have recently been developed. A particularly powerful approach uses data that consist of bi-allelic markers (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism data) and allows for exact likelihood computations of phylogenetic networks while numerically integrating over all possible gene trees per marker. While the approach has good accuracy in terms of estimating the network and its parameters, likelihood computations remain a major computational bottleneck and limit the methods applicability.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we first demonstrate why likelihood computations of networks take orders of magnitude more time when compared to trees. We then propose an approach for inference of phylo-genetic networks based on pseudo-likelihood using bi-allelic markers.

Furthermore, we demonstrate aspects of robustness of the method to violations in the underlying assumptions of the employed statistical model. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the method to biological data. The proposed method allows for analyzing larger data sets in terms of the numbers of taxa and reticulation events.

As such, ecologists often adapt techniques and ideas from industry and other scientific fields to design and build equipment, tools, and experimental contraptions custom-made for the ecological systems under study. Three-dimensional (3D) printing provides a way to rapidly produce identical and novel objects that could be used in ecological studies, yet ecologists have been slow to adopt this new technology. Here, we provide ecologists with an introduction to 3D printing.\n\nResultsFirst, we give an overview of the ecological research areas in which 3D printing is predicted to be the most impactful and review current studies that have already used 3D printed objects. We then outline a methodological workflow for integrating 3D printing into an ecological research program and give a detailed example of a successful implementation of our 3D printing workflow for 3D printed models of the brown anole, Anolis sagrei, for a field predation study. After testing two print media in the field, we show that the models printed from the less expensive and more sustainable material (blend of 70% plastic and 30% recycled wood fiber) were just as durable and had equal predator attack rates as the more expensive material (100% virgin plastic).\n\nConclusionsOverall, 3D printing can provide time and cost savings to ecologists, and with recent advances in less toxic, biodegradable, and recyclable print materials, ecologists can choose to minimize social and environmental impacts associated with 3D printing. The main hurdles for implementing 3D printing - availability of resources like printers, scanners, and software, as well as reaching proficiency in using 3D image software - may be easier to overcome at institutions with digital imaging centers run by knowledgeable staff. As with any new technology, the benefits of 3D printing are specific to a particular project, and ecologists must consider the investments of developing usable 3D materials for research versus other methods of generating those materials.","10.1186/s12898-018-0190-z"

Recent progress in elucidating the genetic architecture of schizophrenia has highlighted the association of multiple loci and rare variants that may impact susceptibility. One key example, given their potential etiopathogenic and therapeutic relevance, is a set of genes that encode proteins that regulate excitatory glutamatergic synapses in brain. A critical next step is to delineate specifically how such genetic variation impacts synaptic plasticity and to determine if and how the encoded proteins interact biochemically with one another to control cognitive function in a convergent manner. Towards this goal, here we study the roles of GPCR-kinase interacting protein 1 (GIT1), a synaptic scaffolding and signaling protein with damaging coding variants found in schizophrenia patients, as well as copy number variants found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. We generated conditional neural-selective GIT1 knockout mice and find that these mice have deficits in fear conditioning learning and spatial memory. Using global quantitative phospho-proteomics, we revealed that GIT1 deletion in brain perturbs specific networks of GIT1-interacting synaptic proteins. Importantly, several schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorder risk genes are present within these networks. We propose that GIT1 regulates the phosphorylation of a network of synaptic proteins and other critical regulators of neuroplasticity, and that perturbation of these networks may contribute to cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders.","NA"

This \""fishing down the food web\"" is often attributed to reduced densities of high-trophic-level species, reflecting changes in the structure of harvested food webs. However, this pattern can also result from a restructuring of the fishery, that shifts from a focus on depleted upper trophic levels to abundant lower trophic levels. In fact, we show here that fishing down the food web can emerge from the adaptive harvesting of a predator-prey community, where changes in fishing patterns are driven by the relative profitabilities of the harvested species. The shift from a predator- to a prey-focused fishing pattern can yield abrupt changes in the system, and cause sudden losses in species densities. Such regime shifts occur when the predator species is highly valuable relative to the prey, and if it exerts a strong top-down control on the lower trophic level. Moreover, we find that when the two species are jointly harvested, high adaptation speeds can reduce the resilience of fisheries. Our results therefore suggest that flexibility in harvesting strategies will not necessarily benefit fisheries but may actually harm their sustainability.","NA"

Herpes virions contains large icosahedral capsids that have a portal at a unique five-fold vertex, similar to that seen in the tailed bacteriophages. The portal is a molecular motor through which the viral genome enters the capsid during virion morphogenesis. The genome also exits the capsid through the portal-vertex when it is injected through the nuclear-pore into the nucleus of a new host cell to initiate infection. Structural investigations of the herpesvirus portal-vertex have proven challenging, owing to the small size of the tail-like portal-vertex associated tegument (PVAT), and the dense tegument layer that lays between the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope, obscuring the view of the portal-vertex. Here we show the structure of the herpes simplex virus portal-vertex at sub-nanometer resolution, solved by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) and single-particle 3D reconstruction. This led to a number of new discoveries including the presence of two previously unknown portal associated structures that occupy the sites normally taken by the penton and the Ta triplex. Our data revealed that the PVAT is composed of ten copies of the C-terminal domain of pUL25, which are uniquely arranged as two tiers of star-shaped density. Our 3D reconstruction of the portal-vertex also shows that one end of the viral genome extends outside the portal in the manner described for some bacteriophage but not previously seen in any eukaryote viruses. Finally, we show that the viral genome is consistently packed in a highly-ordered left-handed spool to form concentric shells of DNA.

Their aberrant expression can have oncogenic or tumor suppressor function directly participating to carcinogenesis, malignant transformation, invasiveness and metastasis. Indeed, miRNA profiles can distinguish not only between normal and cancerous tissue but they can also successfully classify different subtypes of a particular cancer. Here, we focus on a particular class of transcripts encoding polycistronic miRNA genes that yields multiple miRNA components. We describe clustered MiRNA Master Regulator Analysis (ClustMMRA), a fully redesigned release of the MMRA computational pipeline (MiRNA Master Regulator Analysis), developed to search for clustered miRNAs potentially driving cancer molecular subtyping. Genomically clustered miRNAs are frequently co-expressed to target different components of pro-tumorigenic signalling pathways. By applying ClustMMRA to breast cancer patient data, we identified key miRNA clusters driving the phenotype of different tumor subgroups. The pipeline was applied to two independent breast cancer datasets, providing statistically concordant results between the two analysis. We validated in cell lines the miR-199/miR-214 as a novel cluster of miRNAs promoting the triple negative subtype phenotype through its control of proliferation and EMT.","10.1093/nar/gkz016"

Such situations arise when successive interspecific hybridizations in combination with genome duplications have shaped species phylogenies. Several processes such as homoeolog loss and deep coalescence can potentially hamper our ability to recover the historical signal correctly. Consequently the prospect of reconstructing accurate phylogenies lies in the combination of several low-copy nuclear markers that when, used in concert, can provide homoeologs for all the ancestral genomes and help to disentangle gene tree incongruence due to deep coalescence events. Expressed sequence tag (EST) databases represent valuable resource for the identification of genes in organisms with uncharacterized genomes and for development of molecular markers. The genus Silene L. is a prime example of a plant group whose evolutionary history involves numerous events of hybridization and polyploidization. As for many groups there is currently a shortage of low-copy nuclear markers, for which phylogenetic usefulness has been demonstrated. Here, we present two EST libraries for two species of Silene that belong to large phylogenetic groups not previously investigated with next generation technologies.

Since extracellular or vacuole-constrained bacteria are thought to rarely access the cytoplasm, how their LPS are exposed to the cytosolic sensors is a critical event for pathogen recognition. Hemolysin is a pore-forming bacterial toxin, which was generally accepted to rupture cell membrane, leading to cell lysis. Whether and how hemolysin participates in non-canonical inflammasome signaling remains uncovered. Here, we show that hemolysin-overexpressed enterobacteria triggered significantly increased caspase-4 activation in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Hemolysin promoted LPS cytosolic delivery from extracellular bacteria through dynamin-dependent endocytosis. Further, we revealed that hemolysin was largely associated with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and induced rupture of OMV-containing vacuoles, subsequently increasing LPS exposure to the cytosolic sensor. Accordingly, overexpression of hemolysin promoted caspase-11 dependent IL-18 secretion, gut inflammation, and enterocyte pyroptosis in orally-infected mice, which was associated with restricting bacterial colonization in vivo. Together, our work reveals a concept that hemolysin promotes noncanonical inflammasome activation via liberating OMVs for cytosolic LPS sensing, which offers insights into innate immune surveillance of dysregulated hemolysin via caspase-11/4 in intestinal antibacterial defenses.\n\nSignificanceSensing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the cytosol triggers non-canonical inflammasome-mediated innate responses. Recent work revealed that bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) enables LPS to access the cytosol for extracellular bacteria. However, since intracellular OMVs are generally constrained in endosomes, how OMV-derived LPS gain access to the cytosol remains unknown. Here, we reported that hemolysin largely bound with OMVs and entered cells through dynamin-dependent endocytosis. Intracellular hemolysin significantly impaired OMVs-constrained vacuole integrity and increased OMV-derived LPS exposure to the cytosolic sensor, which promoted non-canonical inflammasome activation and restricted bacterial gut infections. This work reveals the role of hemolysin in promoting non-canonical inflammasome activation and alerting host immune recognition, which provides insights into the more sophisticated biological functions of hemolysin upon infection.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007240"

Here, we investigate the potential trade-off between female ornamentation and fecundity in the sex-role reversed, wide-bodied pipefish, Stigmatopora nigra. We measured two components of the female ornament, body width and stripe thickness, and tested the relationship between these ornaments and female fecundity and the mean egg size. Both body width and stripe thickness were strongly and positively related to female body size. After controlling for the influence of body size, we found no evidence of a cost of belly width or stripe thickness on female fecundity. Rather, females that have larger ornaments have higher fecundity and thus a greater relative fitness advantage. However, larger females suffered a slight decrease in egg size, consistent with a potential trade-off between egg size and body size, although no relationship between egg size and ornaments was observed. Our results suggest that larger S. nigra females accurately advertise their reproductive value to males, and underscore the importance of investigating the potential mechanisms that promote and maintain honesty of female ornaments.","10.1002/ece3.4459"

Traditional peptide identification algorithms perform well when identifying unmodified peptides. However, when peptides have post-translational modifications (PTMs), these methods cannot provide satisfactory results. Recently, Chick et al., 2015 and Yu et al., 2016 proposed the spectrum-based and tag-based open search methods, respectively, to identify peptides with PTMs. While the performance of these two methods is promising, the identification results vary greatly with respect to the quality of tandem mass spectra and the number of PTMs in peptides. This motivates us to systematically study the relationship between the performance of open search methods and quality parameters of tandem mass spectrum data, as well as the number of PTMs in peptides.\n\nResultsThrough large-scale simulations, we obtain the performance trend when simulated tandem mass spectra are of different quality. We propose an analytical model to describe the relationship between the probability of obtaining correct identifications and the spectrum quality as well as the number of PTMs. Based on the analytical model, we can quantitatively describe the necessary condition to effectively apply open search methods.\n\nAvailabilitySource codes of the simulation are available at http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/PST.html.\n\nContactboningli@ust.hk or eeyu@ust.hk\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","NA"

Early detection of these molecular changes is a key aspect for the success of interventions aimed at slowing down rates of cognitive decline. Recent evidence indicates that of the two established methods for measuring amyloid, a decrease in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) amyloid {beta}1-42 (A{beta}1-42) may be an earlier indicator of Alzheimers disease risk than measures of amyloid obtained from Positron Emission Topography (PET). However, CSF collection is highly invasive and expensive. In contrast, blood collection is routinely performed, minimally invasive and cheap. In this work, we develop a blood-based signature that can provide a cheap and minimally invasive estimation of an individuals CSF amyloid status using a machine learning approach. We show that a Random Forest model derived from plasma analytes can accurately predict subjects as having abnormal (low) CSF A{beta}1-42 levels indicative of AD risk (0.84 AUC, 0.78 sensitivity, and 0.73 specificity). Refinement of the modeling indicates that only APOE{varepsilon}4 carrier status and four analytes are required to achieve a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, we show across an independent validation cohort that individuals with predicted abnormal CSF A{beta}1-42 levels transitioned to an AD diagnosis over 120 months significantly faster than those predicted with normal CSF A{beta}1-42 levels and that the resulting model also performs reasonably across PET A{beta}1-42 status.\n\nThis is the first study to show that a machine learning approach, using plasma protein levels, age and APOE{varepsilon}4 carrier status, is able to predict CSF A{beta}1-42 status, the earliest risk indicator for AD, with high accuracy.","10.1038/s41598-018-37149-7"

G.; Thrall, P. H.","Loup Rimbaud","CSIRO Agriculture and Food","2018-03-28",2,"15","new results","evolutionary biology","Genetically-controlled plant resistance can reduce the damage caused by pathogens. However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance. This often occurs quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and a continuing need to develop new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolution of pathogen populations and thus increase genetic resistance durability. These strategies mainly rely on varying different combinations of resistance sources across time (crop rotations) and space. The spatial scale of deployment can vary from multiple resistance sources occurring in a single cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within the same field (cultivar mixtures) or in different fields (mosaics). However, experimental comparison of the efficiency (i.e. ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (i.e. ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown) of landscape-scale deployment strategies presents major logistical challenges.\n\nTherefore, we developed a spatially explicit stochastic model able to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes of the four major deployment options described above, including both qualitative resistance (i.e. major genes) and quantitative resistance traits against several components of pathogen aggressiveness: infection rate, latent period duration, propagule production rate, and infectious period duration. This model, implemented in the R package landsepi, provides a new and useful tool to assess the performance of a wide range of deployment options, and helps investigate the effect of landscape, epidemiological and evolutionary parameters.\n\nThis article describes the model and its parameterisation for rust diseases of cereal crops, caused by fungi of the genus Puccinia. To illustrate the model, we use it to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary potential of the combination of a major gene and different traits of quantitative resistance. The comparison of the four major deployment strategies described above will be the objective of future studies.\n\nAuthor summaryThere are many recent examples which demonstrate the evolutionary potential of plant pathogens to overcome the resistances deployed in agricultural landscapes to protect our crops. Increasingly, it is recognised that how resistance is deployed spatially and temporally can impact on rates of pathogen evolution and resistance breakdown. Such deployment strategies are mainly based on the combination of several sources of resistance at different spatiotemporal scales. However, comparison of these strategies in a predictive sense is not an easy task, owing to the logistical difficulties associated with experiments involving the spread of a pathogen at large spatio-temporal scales. Moreover, both the durability of a strategy and the epidemiological protection it provides to crops must be assessed since these evaluation criteria are not necessarily correlated. Surprisingly, no current simulation model allows a thorough comparison of the different options. Here we describe a spatio-temporal model able to simulate a wide range of deployment strategies and resistance sources. This model, implemented in the R package landsepi, facilitates assessment of both epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes across simulated scenarios. In this work, the model is used to investigate the combination of different sources of resistance against fungal diseases such as rusts of cereal crops.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006067"

Through a genome-wide study of chromatin-associated proteins in Drosophila cells, five major chromatin types were identified as a refinement of the traditional binary division into hetero- and euchromatin. These five types are defined by distinct but overlapping combinations of proteins and differ in biological and biochemical properties, including transcriptional activity, replication timing and histone modifications. In this work, we assess the evolutionary relationships of chromatin-associated proteins and present an integrated view of the evolution and conservation of the fruit fly D. melanogaster chromatin landscape. We combine homology prediction across a wide range of species with gene age inference methods to determine the origin of each chromatin-associated protein. This provides insight into the emergence of the different chromatin types. Our results indicate that the two euchromatic types, YELLOW and RED, were one single activating type that split early in eukaryotic history. Next, we provide evidence that GREEN-associated proteins are involved in a centromere drive and expanded in a lineage-specific way in D. melanogaster. Our results on BLUE chromatin support the hypothesis that the emergence of Polycomb Group proteins is linked to eukaryotic multicellularity. In light of these results, we discuss how the regulatory complexification of chromatin links to the origins of eukaryotic multicellularity.","10.1093/gbe/evz019"

Its assessment often relies on self-report measures of pain-related fear by a variety of questionnaires.

Furthermore, the relationship to other anxiety measures such as state or trait anxiety remains ambiguous. Because the neural bases of fearful and anxious states are well described, advances in neuroimaging such as machine learning on brain activity patterns recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging might help to dissect commonalities or differences across pain-related fear constructs. We applied a pattern regression approach in 20 non-specific chronic low back pain patients to reveal predictive relationships between fear-related neural information and different pain-related fear questionnaires. More specifically, the applied Multiple Kernel Learning approach allowed generating models to predict the questionnaire scores based on a hierarchical ranking of fear-related neural patterns induced by viewing videos of potentially harmful activities for the back. We sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors. The results underpin the diversity of pain-related fear constructs by demonstrating evidence of non-overlapping neural predictors within fear processing regions. This neuroscientific approach might ultimately help to further understand and dissect psychological pain-related fear constructs.\n\nSignificancePain-related fear, often assessed through self-reports such as questionnaires, has shown prognostic value and clinical utility for a variety of musculoskeletal pain disorders.

These ipRGCs influence multiple functions not directly related to vision such as the synchronization of circadian rhythmicity, pupil constriction, the regulation of alertness and sleep, as well as the modulation of cognition. More recently, it was demonstrated that ipRGCs may also contribute to basic visual functions. The impact of ipRGCs on visual functions, independently of image forming photoreceptors, remains however difficult to isolate, particularly in humans. We previously showed that exposure to intense monochromatic blue light (465nm) induced awareness of light in a forced choice task in three rare totally visually blind individuals without detectable rod and cone function, but who retained non-visual responses to light, very likely via ipRGCs. The neural foundation of such light awareness in the absence of conscious vision is unknown, however. In this study, we characterized the brain activity of these three rare participants using electroencephalography (EEG), and demonstrate that unconsciously perceived light triggers an early and reliable transient desynchronization (i.e. decreased power) of the alpha EEG rhythm (8-14 Hz) over the occipital cortex. These results provide compelling insight into how ipRGC may contribute to transient changes in ongoing brain activity. They suggest that occipital alpha rhythm synchrony, which is typically linked to the visual system, is modulated by ipRGCs photoreception; a process that may contribute to the awareness of light in those blind individuals.","NA"

These observations led to the formulation of the \""mitochondrial climatic adaptation\"" hypothesis, for which all published evidence to date is correlational. Here, we use laboratory-based experimental evolution in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to test whether thermal selection can shift population frequencies of two mtDNA haplogroups whose natural frequencies exhibit clinal associations with latitude along the Australian east-coast. We present experimental evidence that the thermal regime in which the laboratory populations were maintained, drove changes in haplogroup frequencies across generations. Our results strengthen the emerging view that intra-specific mtDNA variants are sensitive to selection, and suggest spatial distributions of mtDNA variants in natural populations of metazoans might reflect adaptation to climatic environments rather than within-population coalescence and diffusion of selectively-neutral haplotypes across populations.\n\nImpact SummaryWe applied experimental laboratory evolution to provide the first direct test of the \""mitochondrial climatic hypothesis,\"" which predicts that the variation of mitochondrial genomes across natural distributions of metazoans can be shaped by thermal selection. Our design is the first of its kind when it comes to inferring the role of thermal selection in shaping mtDNA frequencies in nature. We harness two naturally occurring mtDNA haplotypes of Drosophila melanogaster that segregate along the east coast of Australia. One of these haplotypes predominates at sub-tropical northern latitudes and the other in the temperate and cooler south of the country. We then compete these haplotypes against each other in replicated experimental fly populations submitted to one of four different thermal regimes, in either the presence or absence of infection by Wolbachia, a coevolved endosymbiont that also exhibits maternal transmission.\n\nWe confirm that when evolving in the laboratory under warmer conditions, a haplotype naturally predominating in subtropical conditions outcompetes a haplotype that predominates at cooler Australian latitudes in the wild. We see this effect on haplotype frequencies in females in populations where latent Wolbachia infections had been purged.\n\nOur results also suggest that sex-specificity of mtDNA effects, and co-occurrence of other maternally-inherited microbiotic entities - of which Wolbachia is just one example - are likely to shape the trajectories of mitochondrial genome evolution in the wild.","10.1038/s41598-018-27805-3"

Previously, we established a voluntary upper-extremity loading model that assigns a persons target force based on their subject-specific, continuum FE-estimated radius bone strain. Here, our purpose was to quantify the inter-individual variability in radius microstructure and FE-estimated strain explained by site-specific mechanical loading history, and to determine whether variability in strain is captured by aBMD, a clinically relevant measure of bone density and fracture risk. Seventy-two women aged 21-40 were included in this cross-sectional analysis. High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) was used to measure macro- and micro-structure in the distal radius. Mean energy equivalent strain in the distal radius was calculated from continuum finite element models generated from clinical resolution CT images of the forearm. Areal BMD was used in a nonlinear regression model to predict FE strain. Hierarchical linear regression models were used to assess the predictive capability of intrinsic (age, height) and modifiable (body mass, grip strength, physical activity) predictors. Fifty-one percent of the variability in FE bone strain was explained by its relationship with aBMD, with higher density predicting lower strains. Age and height explained up to 31.6% of the variance in microstructural parameters.

However, currently available approaches require a large number of plasma samples from healthy individuals, sequenced using the same platform and protocols to act as a reference panel. Obtaining this reference panel can be challenging, prohibitively expensive and limits the ability to migrate to improved sequencing platforms and improved protocols.\n\nMethodsWe developed qCNV and sCNA-seq, two distinct tools that together provide a new approach for profiling somatic copy number alterations (sCNA) through the analysis of cell free DNA (cfDNA) without a reference panel. Our approach was designed to identify sCNA from cfDNA through the analysis of a single plasma sample and a matched normal DNA sample -both of which can be obtained from the same blood draw. qCNV is an efficient method for extracting read-depth from BAM files and sCNA-seq is a method that uses a probabilistic model of read depth to infer the copy number segmentation of the tumour. We compared the results from our pipeline to the established copy number profile of a cell-line, as well as the results from the plasma-Seq analysis of cfDNA-like mixtures and real, clinical data-sets.\n\nResultsWith a single, unmatched, germline reference sample, our pipeline recapitulated the known copy number profile of a cell-line and demonstrated similar results to those obtained from plasma-Seq. With less than 1X genome coverage, our approach identified clinically relevant sCNA in samples with as little as 20 % tumour DNA. When applied to plasma samples from cancer patients, our pipeline identified clinically significant mutations.\n\nConclusionsThese results show it is possible to identify therapeutically-relevant copy number mutations from plasma samples without the need to generate a reference panel from a large number of healthy individuals. Together with the range of sequencing platforms supported by our qCNV+sCNA-Seq pipeline, as well as the Galaxy implementation of this solution, this pipeline makes cfDNA profiling more accessible and makes it easier to identify sCNA from the plasma of cancer patients.","NA"

Although their direct effects on hosts are well-studied, indirect impacts on trophic networks, thus on non-host species, remain unclear.\n\nIn this study, we investigate the consequences of parasitism on coexistence and stability within a simple trophic module: one predator consuming two prey species in competition. We test how such effects depend on the infected species (prey or predator). We account for two effects of parasitism: the virulence effect (parasites affect the infected species intrinsic growth rate through direct effects on fecundity or mortality) and the interaction effect (increased vulnerability of infected prey or increased food intake of infected predators).\n\nResults show that coexistence is favored when effects have intermediate intensity. We link this result to modifications of direct and apparent competitions among prey species. Given a prey infection, accounting for susceptible-infected population structure highlights that coexistence may also be reduced due to predator-parasite competition.\n\nParasites affect stability by modulating energy transfer from prey to predator. Predator infection therefore has a stabilizing effect due to increased energy fluxes and/or predator mortality.\n\nOur results suggest that parasites potentially increase species coexistence. Precise predictions however require an assessment of various parasite effects. We discuss the implications of our results for the functioning of trophic networks and the evolution of foraging strategies within food webs.","10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.09.004"

Despite much research in this area, to date, neuroimaging-based models are not able to characterize individuals with ASD with sufficient sensitivity and specificity; this is likely due to the heterogeneity and complexity of this disorder. Here we apply a data-driven subject-level approach, connectome-based predictive modeling, to resting-state fMRI data from a set of individuals from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. Using leave-one-subject-out and split-half analyses, we define two functional connectivity networks that predict continuous scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and confirm that these networks generalize to novel subjects. Notably, these networks were found to share minimal anatomical overlap. Further, our results generalize to individuals for whom SRS/ADOS scores are unavailable, predicting worse scores for ASD than typically developing individuals. In addition, predicted SRS scores for individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from the ADHD-200 Consortium are linked to ADHD symptoms, supporting the hypothesis that the functional brain organization changes relevant to ASD severity share a component associated with attention. Finally, we explore the membership of predictive connections within conventional (atlas-based) functional networks. In summary, our results suggest that an individuals functional connectivity profile contains information that supports dimensional, non-binary classification in ASD, aligning with the goals of precision medicine and individual-level diagnosis.","NA"

They constitute an attractive alternative to transcription factors for building synthetic gene regulatory networks because they can be engineered de novo and they have a fast turnover and a low metabolic burden. However, riboregulators are generally designed in silico and tested in vivo, which only provides a yes/no evaluation of their performances, thus hindering the improvement of design algorithms. Here we show that a cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system provides valuable quantitative information about the performances of in silico designed riboregulators. In particular, we use the ribosome as an exquisite molecular machine that detects functional riboregulators, precisely measures their concentration and linearly amplifies the signal by generating a fluorescent protein. We apply this method to characterize two types of translational riboregulators composed of a cis-repressed (cr) and a trans-activating (ta) strand. At the DNA level we demonstrate that high concentrations of taDNA poisoned the activator until total shut off. At the RNA level, we show that this approach provides a fast and simple way to measure dissociation constants of functional riboregulators, in contrast to standard mobility-shift assays. Our method opens the route for using cell-free TX-TL systems for the quantitative characterization of functional riboregulators in order to improve their design in silico.","10.1021/acssynbio.7b00387"

This method traps molecules within the focal plane while excluding signal from out-of-focus probes. Simultaneously, the molecules can freely diffuse within the nanopits, allowing for accurate measurements of exchange rates, unlike other methods which could introduce an artifactual bias in measurements of binding kinetics. We demonstrate that the plasmids structure influences the binding of the fluorescent probes to the unwinding site through the presence, or lack, of other secondary structures. With this method, we observe an increase in the binding rate of the fluorescent probe to the unwinding site with increasing temperature and negative supercoiling. This increase in binding is consistent with the results of our numerical simulations of the probability of site-unwinding.

Reference tissue methods (Logan graphical analysis (LGA) and multilinear reference tissue method (MRTM2)) were investigated for quantification of [18F]MK-6240 distribution volume ratios (DVRs) in a subset of nineteen participants. Stability of DVR methods was evaluated using truncated scan durations. Standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) estimates were compared to DVR estimates to determine the optimal timing window for SUVR analysis. Parametric SUVR images were used to identify regions of potential off-target binding and to compare binding patterns with neurofibrillary tau staging established in neuropathology literature.\n\nResultsStandard uptake values in the pons and the inferior cerebellum indicated consistent clearance across all 51 subjects.

We combine advantages of previous reviews and use a realistic data simulation, examine moderators and provide inferential statistics for the comparison of all three indices of phase-amplitude coupling. Our analyses show that all three indices successfully differentiate coupling strength and coupling width when monophasic coupling is present. While the mean vector length was most sensitive to modulations in coupling strengths and width, biphasic coupling can solely be detected by the modulation index. Coupling values of all three indices were influenced by moderators including data length, signal-to-noise-ratio, and sampling rate when approaching Nyquist frequencies. The modulation index was most robust against confounding influences of these moderators.

A joint network construction that borrows information from related structures across conditions has the potential to improve the power of the analysis.\n\nOne possible approach to constructing the co-expression network is to use the Gaussian graphical model.

Interestingly, we observe that the genes strongly associated with survival time in the TCGA dataset are less likely to be network hubs, suggesting that genes associated with cancer progression are likely to govern specific functions, rather than regulating a large number of biological processes. Additionally, we observed that the tumor-specific hub genes tend to have few shared edges with normal tissue, revealing tumor-specific regulatory mechanism.\n\nAuthor summaryGene co-expression networks provide insights into the mechanism of cellular activity and gene regulation. Condition-specific mechanisms may be identified by constructing and comparing co-expression networks of multiple conditions. We propose a novel statistical method to jointly construct co-expression networks for gene expression profiles from multiple conditions. By using a data-driven approach to capture condition-specific co-expression patterns, this method is effective in identifying both co-expression patterns that are specific to a condition and that are common across conditions. The application of this method on real datasets reveals interesting biological insights.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006436"

In Drosophila melanogaster, the majority of these studies have analyzed North American and Australian populations, leading to the identification of several loci and traits under selection. However, populations in these two continents showed evidence of admixture that likely contributed to the observed population differentiation patterns. Thus, disentangling demography from selection is challenging when analyzing these populations. European populations could be a suitable system to identify loci under spatially varying selection provided that no recent admixture from African populations would have occurred. In this work, we individually sequence the genome of 42 European strains collected in populations from contrasting environments: Stockholm (Sweden), and Castellana Grotte, (Southern Italy). We found low levels of population structure and no evidence of recent African admixture in these two populations. We thus look for patterns of spatially varying selection affecting individual genes and gene sets. Besides single nucleotide polymorphisms, we also investigate the role of transposable elements in local adaptation. We concluded that European populations are a good dataset to identify loci under spatially varying selection. The analysis of the two populations sequenced in this work in the context of all the available D. melanogaster data allowed us to pinpoint genes and biological processes relevant for local adaptation. Identifying and analyzing populations with low levels of population structure and admixture should help to disentangle selective from non-selective forces underlying patterns of population differentiation in other species as well.","10.1038/s41598-018-34267-0"

Here we show that in vitro ZIKV infection of human cells, including NPCs, causes disruption of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. NMD is a cellular mRNA surveillance mechanism that is required for normal brain size in mice2-4. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we identified multiple cellular NMD factors that bind to the viral capsid protein, including the central NMD regulator up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1)5. Endogenous UPF1 interacted with the viral capsid protein in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and capsid expression post-transcriptionally downregulated UPF1, a process that we confirmed occurs during de novo ZIKV infection. A further decrease in UPF1 levels by RNAi significantly enhanced ZIKV infection in NPC cultures. We therefore propose that ZIKV, via the capsid protein, has evolved a strategy to dampen antiviral activities of NMD6,7, which subsequently contributes to neuropathology in vivo.","10.1128/mbio.02126-18"

However, there are no standardized calibration particles available that permit the cross-comparison of different measurement techniques operating at different stresses and time-scales. Here we present the rational design, production, and comprehensive characterization of poly-acylamide (PAAm) microgel beads mimicking biological cells. We produced mono-disperse beads at rates of 20 - 60 kHz by means of a microfluidic droplet generator, where the pre-gel composition was adjusted to tune the beads elasticity in the range of cell and tissue relevant mechanical properties. We verified bead homogeneity by optical diffraction tomography and Brillouin microscopy. Consistent elastic behavior of microgel beads at different shear rates was confirmed by AFM-enabled nanoindentation and real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC). The remaining inherent variability in elastic modulus was rationalized using polymer theory and effectively reduced by sorting based on forward-scattering using conventional flow cytometry. Our results show that PAAm microgel beads can be standardized as mechanical probes, to serve not only for validation and calibration of cell mechanical measurements, but also as cell-scale stress sensors.\n\nSignificance StatementOften vastly different cell mechanical properties are reported even for the same cell type when employing different measurement techniques. This discrepancy shows the urgent need for standardized calibration particles to cross-compare and validate techniques. Microgel beads can serve this purpose, but they have to fulfil specific requirements such as homogeneity, sizes and elasticities in the range of the cells, and they have to provide comparable results independent of the method applied. Here we demonstrate the standardized production of polyacrylamide microgel beads with all the features an elastic cell-mimic should have. These can not only be used as method calibration particles, but can also serve as cell-scale sensors to quantify normal and shear stresses exerted by other cells and inside tissues, enabling many new applications.","10.1039/C8TB01421C"

In Australia, the vanB genotype is dominant; however there has been a recent increase in the predominantly plasmid-encoded vanA genotype, prompting investigation into the genomic epidemiology of VREfm in this context.\n\nMaterials and MethodsA cross-sectional study of VREfm in Victoria, Australia (Nov.10th - Dec.9th, 2015). A total of 321 VREfm isolates (from 286 patients) were collected and whole-genome sequenced with Illumina NextSeq. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to assess relatedness. Multi-locus sequence types (STs), and genes associated with resistance and virulence were identified. The vanA-harbouring plasmid from an isolate from each ST was assembled using long-read data.\n\nResultsvanA-VREfm comprised 17.8% of isolates. ST203, ST80 and a pstS(-) clade, ST1421, predominated (30.5%, 30.5% and 37.2% of vanA-VREfm, respectively). Most vanB-VREfm were ST796 (77.7%). vanA-VREfm isolates were closely-related within hospitals vs. between them (core SNPs 10 [interquartile range 1-357] vs. 356 [179-416] respectively), suggesting discrete introductions of vanA-VREfm, with subsequent intra-hospital transmission. In contrast, vanB-VREfm had similar core SNP distributions within vs. between hospitals, due to widespread dissemination of ST796. Overall, vanA-harbouring plasmids differed across STs, and with exception of ST78 and ST796, Tn1546 transposons also varied.\n\nConclusionsvanA-VREfm in Victoria is associated with multiple STs, and is not solely mediated by a single shared plasmid/Tn1546 transposon; clonal transmission appears to play an important role, predominantly within, rather than between, hospitals. In contrast, vanB-VREfm appears to be well-established and widespread across Victorian healthcare institutions.","NA"

Here we followed the hypothesis that a previously described retinal region, the locus of maximal rod density, functionally replaces the fovea; we found that with dark background, most of the fixations direct the fovea above the target, so that the targets image appears to fall on the line connecting the fovea with the locus of maximal rod density. There is considerable trial-by-trial variation in the fixation positions along this line. On the whole, the closer the visual conditions are to full scotopic, the higher is this gaze upshift, indicating the closer does the target fall to the locus of maximal rod density. Mesopic background induces low mean upshift. Full (45-min) dark adaptation was essential to achieving high upshift values.

Proteins adopt their structure autonomously by the process of protein folding. Over the last decades, the folding process of several proteins has been studied with temporal and spatial resolution which allowed the identification of so-called Early Folding Residues (EFR) in the folding process. These structurally relevant residues become affected early in the folding process and initiate the formation of secondary structure elements and guide their assembly.\n\nUsing a dataset of 30 proteins and 3,337 residues provided by the Start2Fold database, discriminative features of EFR were identified by a systematical characterization. Therefore, proteins were represented as graphs in order to analyze topological descriptors of EFR. They constitute crucial connectors of protein regions which are distant at sequence level. Especially, these residues exhibit a high number of non-covalent contacts such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. This tendency also manifest as energetically stable local regions in a knowledge-based potential. Conclusively, these features are not only characteristic for EFR but also differ significantly with respect to functional residues. This unveils a split between structurally and functionally relevant residues in proteins which can drastically improve their evolvability and robustness.\n\nThe characteristics of EFR cannot be attributed to trivial features such as the accessible surface area. Thus, the presented features are novel descriptors for EFR of the folding process. Potentially, these features can be used to design classifiers to predict EFR from structure or to implement structure quality assessment programs. The shown division of labor between functional and EFR has implications for the prediction of mutation effects as well as protein design and can provide insights into the evolution of proteins. Finally, EFR allow to further the understanding of the protein folding process due to their pivotal role.\n\nAuthor summaryProteins are chains of amino acids which adopt a three-dimensional structure and are then able to catalyze chemical reactions or propagate signals in organisms. Without external influence, most proteins fold into their correct structure, and a small number of Early Folding Residues (EFR) have been shown to become affected at the very start of the process. We demonstrated that these residues are located in energetically stable local conformations. EFR are in contact to many other residues of a protein and act as hubs between sequentially distant regions of a proteins. These distinct characteristics can give insights into what causes certain residues to initiate and guide the folding process. Furthermore, it can help our understanding regarding diseases such as Alzheimers or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which are the result of protein folding gone wrong. We further found that the structurally relevant EFR are almost exclusively non-functional. Proteins separate structure and function, which increases evolvability and robustness and gives guidance for the artificial design of proteins.","10.1371/journal.pone.0206369"

This conjectured signaling mechanism has been invoked to explain how cells coordinate changes in shape, motility, and vesicle fusion, but the underlying propagation has never been observed. Here we show that propagation of membrane tension occurs quickly in cell-attached blebs, but is largely suppressed in intact cells. The failure of tension to propagate in cells is explained by a fluid dynamical model that incorporates the flow resistance from cytoskeleton-bound transmembrane proteins. In primary endothelial cells, local increases in membrane tension lead only to local activation of mechanosensitive ion channels and to local vesicle fusion. Thus membrane tension is not a mediator of long-range intra-cellular signaling, but local variations in tension mediate distinct processes in sub-cellular domains.","10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.054"

We combine biophysical modeling and analysis of live-cell calcium imaging to explain the fast calcium transient in spines. We show that in the presence of a spine apparatus (SA), which is an extension of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), calcium transients during synaptic inputs rely on rare and extreme calcium ion trajectories. Using numerical simulations, we predicted the asymmetrical distributions of Ryanodine receptors and SERCA pumps that we confirmed experimentally. When calcium ions are released in the spine head, the fastest ions arriving at the base determine the transient timescale through a calcium-induced calcium release mechanism. In general, the fastest particles arriving at a small target are likely to be a generic mechanism that determines the timescale of molecular transduction in cellular neuroscience.\n\nSignificance statementIntrigued by fast calcium transients of few milliseconds in dendritic spines, we investigated its underlying biophysical mechanism. We show here that it is generated by the diffusion of the fastest calcium ions when the spine contains a Spine Apparatus, an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum. This timescale is modulated by the initial number of released calcium ions and the asymmetric distribution of its associated calcium release associated Ryanodyne receptors, present only at the base of a spine. This novel mechanism of calcium signaling that we have unraveled here is driven by the fastest particles. To conclude, the rate of arrival of the fastest particles (ions) to a small target receptor defines the timescale of activation instead of the classical forward rate of chemical reactions introduced by von Smoluchowski in 1916. Applying this new rate theory to transduction should refine our understanding of the biophysical mechanisms underlying molecular signaling.","NA"

Whether the maintenance of the functionality of neurons generated throughout adult life is linked to resilience to cognitive aging remains completely unexplored. Using the immediate early gene Zif268, we analysed the activation of dentate granule neurons born in adult (3 month-old), middle-aged (12 month-old) or senescent (18 month-old) rats (n=96) in response to learning when animals reached 21 month-old. The activation of neurons born during the developmental period was also examined. We show that neurons generated 4, 10 or 19 months before learning (and not developmentally born neurons) are activated in senescent rats with good learning abilities. In contrast, aged rats with bad learning abilities do not exhibit an activity-dependent regulation of Zif268. In conclusion, we propose that resilience to cognitive aging is associated to the responsiveness of neurons born during adult-life.

In this paper, we introduce a smoothing constrained approach - taking into account the reciprocal nature of contacts - where the contact rates are assumed smooth from a cohort perspective as well as from the age distribution of contacts. This is achieved by smoothing over the diagonal components (including all subdiagonals) of the social contact matrix. This approach is supported by the fact that people age with time and thus contact rates should vary smoothly by cohorts.

The original UAS vector, UASt, can only be activated for transgene expression in somatic tissues and not in the germline cells. Rorth (1998) generated UASp, a modified UAS vector that is responsive to Gal4 in both somatic and germline tissues, by replacing both the hsp70 promoter and the SV40 3UTR with the P transposase promoter and the K10 3UTR respectively. At present, the mechanisms by which UASt is silenced in germline cells are not fully understood. Here, we report that the piRNA pathway is involved in suppressing UASt expression in ovarian germline cells. Individually knocking down or mutating components of the piRNA biogenesis pathway (e.g., Piwi, AGO3, Aub, Spn-E, and Vasa) resulted in the expression of the UASt-reporter (GFP or RFP) in the germline. An RNA-seq analysis of small RNAs revealed that the hsp70 promoter of UASt is targeted by piRNAs, and in the aub mutant ovary, the amount of piRNAs targeting the hsp70 promoter is reduced by around 40 folds. In contrast, the SV40 3UTR of the UASt, which happens to be targeted by the Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway, is not responsible for germline UASt suppression, as UASt-reporters with NMD-insensitive 3UTRs fail to show germline expression. Taken together, our studies reveal a crucial role of the piRNA pathway, potentially via the suppression of the hsp70 promoter, in germline UASt silencing in Drosophila ovaries.","10.1016/j.jgg.2018.04.005"

Using a similar approach of presenting images for variable durations to identify sustained activity, we provide the first comprehensive characterization of the manifestation of sustained visual responses as recorded with EEG. In a series of four experiments, we found that both high- and low-frequency sustained responses can be detected on the scalp. The high frequency activity could be detected with high signal to noise ratio only in a subset of individual subjects, in whom it was unequivocal and highly localized. The low frequency sustained response was sensitive to the size and position of the stimulus in the visual field. Both response types showed strong lateralization for stimuli on the left vs. right visual field, suggesting a retinotopic visual cortical source.

In nature, extinctions occur in finite time and rarity corresponds to small, discrete populations whose dynamics are not well approximated by deterministic models. To understand whether the biological significance of these discrepancies, we parameterized a stochastic counter-part of a classical deterministic model of competition using data from annual plants competing on serpentine soils. While the minimum of the invasion growth rates explained up to 60% of the variation in the predicted coexistence times, species pairs with similar invasion growth rates had coexistence times that differed by several orders of magnitude. By integrating the deterministic invasion growth rates and coexistence equilibrium population sizes, a simplified stochastic model explained over 99% of the variation in the coexistence times. This simplified model corresponds to uncoupled single species models whose parameters are determined from the two species model. This simplified model shows that coexistence times are approximately one-half of the harmonic mean of these single species persistence times. Furthermore, coexistence times increase and saturate with invasion growth rates, but increase exponentially with equilibrium population sizes. When the minimum of the invasion growth rate is sufficiently greater than one, coexistence times of 1, 000 years occur even when the inferior species has < 50 individuals at the deterministic coexistence equilibrium. When the fitness inferior has the lower equilibrium population size (which occurs for 6 out of 8 of the deterministically coexisting pairs), niche overlap and fitness differences negatively impact coexistence times, which is consistent with the deterministic theory. However, when the fitness inferior has the higher equilibrium population size (2 species pairs), coexistence times can exhibit a humped shaped relationship with fitness differences-increasing and then decreasing with fitness differences. Collectively our results support the use of deterministic theory to infer the controls over coexistence in finite systems, while also highlighting when ecologists must look beyond invasion growth rates and consider species equilibrium population sizes.","NA"

The small size of insects eyes constrains their optical performance, and so it is unsurprising that they have evolved specializations for optimizing the information they obtain from their habitat. Unraveling how behavioral, environmental, and phylogenetic factors influence the evolution of such specializations is difficult, however, because existing techniques to analyze insect eyes require specimens to be preserved beforehand. To facilitate broad comparative studies on insect eyes and the evolution of complex visual behavior, we developed a novel analysis technique that uses x-ray micro-computed tomography to quantify and recreate the visual world of insects. We use our methodology to investigate the eyes of fungus gnats (Orfeliini), a tribe of diminutive Dipterans, to identify the visual specializations they evolved for surviving in different forest habitats and to explore how this changed over 30 million years of evolutionary history. The specimens we studied were preserved in different ways (in ethanol, air dried, and as an endocast in amber), demonstrating that our method provides a new opportunity to quantitatively study and compare the vision of a wide range insects held in museum collections. Our analysis indicates that different visual specializations have evolved between fungus gnat species living in different forest types and that the eyes of gnats from a similar geographic location have evolved to match the changing environmental conditions. Despite the small size of fungus gnats, evolution has evidentially been able to exploit sensory specializations to meet the differing sensory demands of species from a variety of forest habitats.\n\nSignificance statementDo insects have visual specializations that evolve with changes in their environment? To answer this question, a novel analysis technique is described that uses 3D imaging and simulations to compare the vision of ancient amber-embedded insects to those of their extant relatives. This study investigated the vision of fungus gnats to understand how tiny insects use vision to negotiate forests, some of the worlds most visually complex environments. Despite being amongst the smallest of any flying insect, the gnats miniature eyes have evolved visual specializations specifically adapted for different forest types, allowing different species to meet their visual demands of their specific habitats.","10.1098/rsif.2019.0750"

S.","Lukas Snoek","University of Amsterdam","2018-03-28",1,"1","new results","neuroscience","Over the past decade, multivariate pattern analyses and especially decoding analyses have become a popular alternative to traditional mass-univariate analyses in neuroimaging research. However, a fundamental limitation of decoding analyses is that the source of information driving the decoder is ambiguous, which becomes problematic when the to-be-decoded variable is confounded by variables that are not of primary interest. In this study, we use a comprehensive set of simulations and analyses of empirical data to evaluate two techniques that were previously proposed and used to control for confounding variables in decoding analyses: counterbalancing and confound regression. For our empirical analyses, we attempt to decode gender from structural MRI data when controlling for the confound  brain size. We show that both methods introduce strong biases in decoding performance: counterbalancing leads to better performance than expected (i.e., positive bias), which we show in our simulations is due to the subsampling process that tends to remove samples that are hard to classify; confound regression, on the other hand, leads to worse performance than expected (i.e., negative bias), even resulting in significant below-chance performance in some scenarios. In our simulations, we show that below-chance accuracy can be predicted by the variance of the distribution of correlations between the features and the target. Importantly, we show that this negative bias disappears in both the empirical analyses and simulations when the confound regression procedure performed in every fold of the cross-validation routine, yielding plausible model performance. From these results, we conclude that foldwise confound regression is the only method that appropriately controls for confounds, which thus can be used to gain more insight into the exact source(s) of information driving ones decoding analysis.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe interpretation of decoding models is ambiguous when dealing with confounds;\nC_LIO_LIWe evaluate two methods, counterbalancing and confound regression, in their ability to control for confounds;\nC_LIO_LIWe find that counterbalancing leads to positive bias because it removes hard-to-classify samples;\nC_LIO_LIWe find that confound regression leads to negative bias, because it yields data with less signal than expected by chance;\nC_LIO_LIOur simulations demonstrate a tight relationship between model performance in decoding analyses and the sample distribution of the correlation coefficient;\nC_LIO_LIWe show that the negative bias observed in confound regression can be remedied by cross-validating the confound regression procedure;\nC_LI","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.09.074"

While changes in tendon structure have been linked with tendinopathy, the effects of distance running on tendon structure is not well understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize structural differences in the Achilles tendons in healthy young adults and competitive distance runners using quantitative ultrasound analyses. We hypothesized that competitive distance runners with no clinical signs or symptoms of tendinopathy would have quantitative signs of tendon damage, characterized by decreased collagen alignment and echogenicity, in addition to previous reports of thicker tendons. Longitudinal ultrasound images of the right Achilles tendon mid-substance were acquired in competitive distance runners and recreationally-active adults. Collagen organization, mean echogenicity, and tendon thickness were quantified using image processing techniques. Clinical assessments confirmed that runners had no signs or symptoms of tendinopathy and controls were only included if they had no history of Achilles tendon pain or injuries. Runner tendons were 40% less organized, 48% thicker, and 41% less echogenic compared to the control tendons (p < 0.001). Young adults engaged in competitive distance-running have structurally different tendons than recreationally-active young adults. While these structural differences have been associated with tendon damage, the lack of clinical symptoms of tendinopathy may suggest that these detected differences may either be precursors of tendinopathy development or protective adaptations to cyclic tendon loading experienced during running.","10.1152/japplphysiol.00012.2018"

CTCF and cohesin proteins are located at the anchors of chromatin interactions, forming their loop structures. Other DNA binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143 and SMARCA4 are also reported to be involved in chromatin interactions. However, the overall picture of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator function is still unclear. Here I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach to discover DNA binding motif sequences of transcription factors (TFs), affecting the interaction between enhancers and promoters of genes and their expression by the insulator function of the TFs. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations of DNA motifs of TFs that affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes significantly in monocytes, T cells, HMEC and NPC in common, and included known TFs involved in chromatin interaction and insulator function such as CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1 and ZNF143. The 96 biased orientations of DNA motifs contain 64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF) orientations of DNA motifs (Some TFs have more than one DNA motifs in databases, so the total number is smaller than the sum of FR and RF). To confirm the predicted DNA motifs, first, I compared with chromatin interaction data. Despite the limitation of resolution of chromatin interaction data, for 44 (69%) FR and 28 (54%) RF orientations of DNA motif sequences in CD4+ T cells, EPIs predicted based on an enhancer-promoter association (EPA) that was shortened at the biased orientations of DNA motif sites, overlapped with chromatin interactions significantly more than other types of EPAs. Second, using gene expression data among 53 tissues, 43 (72%) FR and 40 (80%) RF orientations of DNA motifs showed a significantly reduced correlation in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites. Some DNA motif sites of biased orientations of DNA motifs of TFs were found between nearby genes not including DNA motif sites of the known TFs involved in chromatin interactions and between a low correlation of expression level of nearby genes. These analyses suggest that the DNA motifs are associated with insulator functions.","NA"

Rich-clubs, highly interconnected sets of neurons, are known to propagate a disproportionate amount of information within cortical circuits. Here, we test the hypothesis that rich-clubs also perform a disproportionate amount of computation. To do so, we recorded the spiking activity of on average [~]300 well-isolated individual neurons from organotypic cortical cultures. We then constructed weighted, directed networks reflecting the effective connectivity between the neurons. For each neuron, we quantified the amount of computation it performed based on its inputs. We found that rich-club neurons compute [~]200% more information than neurons outside of the rich club. Indeed, the amount of computation performed in the rich-club was proportional to the amount information propagation by the same neurons. This suggests that, in these circuits, information propagation drives computation. Comparing the computation-to-propagation ratio inside versus outside of the rich club showed that rich clubs compute at a slightly, though significantly, reduced level ([~]4% lower). In total, our findings indicate that rich club topology in effective cortical circuits supports not only information propagation but also neural computation.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHere we answer the question of whether rich club topology in functional cortical circuits supports neural computation as it has been previously shown to do for information propagation. To do so, we combined network analysis with information theoretic tools to analyze the spiking activity of hundreds of neurons recorded from organotypic cultures of mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that neurons in rich clubs computed significantly more than neurons outside of rich clubs, suggesting that rich-clubs do support computation in cortical circuits.

Despite the prevalence of these injuries, the mechanism responsible for limited function has not yet been established. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to present preliminary findings that support a hypothesis that skeletal muscle remodeling is the driving factor of poor outcomes in some patients. Biomechanical and ultrasonography assessments were performed on a patient that presented with poor functional outcomes 2.5 years after a surgically-repaired acute Achilles tendon rupture. Single-leg heel raise function was decreased by 70% in the affected limb while walking mechanics showed no deficits. Ultrasonography revealed that the affected limb had shorter, more pennated, and less thick medial gastrocnemius muscles compared to the unaffected limb. A simple computational model of a maximal-effort plantarflexion contraction was employed to test the implications of muscle remodeling on single-leg heel raise function. Subject-specific fascicle length and pennation measurements explained deficits in ankle work and power that strongly agreed with experimentally measured values using motion capture. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that skeletal muscle goes extensively remodels in response to a ruptured tendon, which reduces the amount of work and power the joint can generate. This multidisciplinary framework of biomechanical, imaging, and computational modeling provides a unique platform for studying the complex interactions between structure and function in patients recovering from Achilles tendon injuries.","10.1016/j.jbiomech.2018.08.016"

Geometric measures often utilize magnetic resonance imaging, which can be costly and impractical for many investigations. Estimating moment arm from tendon excursion measured with ultrasonography may provide a cost-effective alternative to geometric measures of moment arm, but how well such measures represent geometry-based moment arms remains in question. The purpose of this study was to determine whether moment arms from tendon excursion can serve as a surrogate for moment arms measured geometrically. Magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging were performed on 19 young male subjects to quantify plantarflexor moment arm based on geometric and tendon excursion paradigms, respectively. These measurements were only moderately correlated (R2 = 0.21, p = 0.052), and moment arm from tendon excursion under-approximated geometric moment arm by nearly 40% (p < 0.001). This moderate correlation between methods is at odds with a prior report (N = 9) of a very strong correlation (R2 = 0.94) in a similar study. Therefore, we performed 92,378 regression analyses (19 choose 9) to determine if such a strong correlation existed in our study population. We found that certain sub-populations of the current study generated similarly strong coefficients of determination (R2 = 0.92), but 84% of all analyses revealed no correlation (p > 0.05).

Analysing the performance and robustness of 22,000,000 gene biomarkers and 6,250,000 subnetwork biomarkers across twenty different training:testing cohort partitions of the meta-dataset revealed that subnetwork biomarkers exhibit superior overall performance and higher concordance across partitions. We find evidence of an upper bound for optimal biomarker size of [~]200 genes or [~]100 subnetworks. Additionally, with both biomarker feature types, larger biomarkers tend to show less consistency in performance across partitions, suggestive of over-fitting. Finally, an evaluation of varying training cohort sizes quantifies the effects of training cohort size.\n\nConclusionsMany groups are developing techniques for exploiting network-based representations of biological pathways to characterize cancer and other diseases.

Mechanistically, IFITM3 blocks hMPV F protein-mediated membrane fusion, and inhibition of infection was reversed by the membrane destabilizing drug amphotericin B. Conversely, we unexpectedly found that infection by some hMPV strains is enhanced by Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), an endosomal protein, suggesting that cellular entry via endocytosis may be particularly advantageous for hMPV despite eventual restriction of this pathway upon induction of IFITM3.

Constraining joint kinematics simplifies these models but the implications of the number of markers used during data acquisition remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to establish the effects of marker placement and quantity on kinematic fidelity when using a constrained-kinematic model. We hypothesized that a constrained-kinematic model would faithfully reproduce lower extremity kinematics regardless of the number of tracking markers removed from the thigh and shank. Healthy-young adults (N = 10) walked on a treadmill at slow, moderate, and fast speeds while skin-mounted markers were tracked using motion capture. Lower extremity kinematics were calculated for 256 combinations of leg and shank markers to establish the implications of marker placement and quantity on joint kinematics. Sagittal joint and hip coronal kinematics errors were smaller than documented errors caused by soft-tissue artifact, which tends to be approximately 5 degrees, when excluding thigh and shank markers. Joint angle and center kinematic errors negatively correlated with the number of markers included in the analyses (R2 > 0.97) and typically showed the greatest error reductions when two markers were included. Further, we demonstrated that a simplified marker set that included markers on the pelvis, lateral knee condyle, lateral malleolus, and shoes produced kinematics that strongly agreed with the traditional marker set.

This ability is essential for stable representation of and appropriate responses to the external environment. How the sensorimotor integration underlying this ability occurs at the level of individual neurons is of keen interest. In Caenorhabditis elegans, RIA interneurons receive input from sensory pathways and have reciprocal connections with head motor neurons. Through separate physiological mechanisms, RIA simultaneously encodes both head orientation and sensory stimuli. Based on these observations, we proposed a model for how RIA may integrate these two signals to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli across head sweeps and generate directional head responses. Here, we show that blocking synaptic release from RIA disrupts head orientation behaviors in response to unilaterally presented stimuli. We found that sensory encoding in RIA is gated according to head orientation. This dependence on head orientation is independent of motor encoding in RIA, suggesting a second, posture-dependent pathway upstream of RIA. This gating mechanism may allow RIA to selectively attend to stimuli that are asymmetric across head sweeps. Attractive odor removal during head bends triggers rapid head withdrawal in the opposite direction. Unlike sensory encoding, this directional response is dependent on motor inputs to and synaptic output from RIA. Together, these results suggest that RIA is part of a sensorimotor pathway that is dynamically regulated according to head orientation at two levels: the first is a gate that filters sensory representations in RIA, and the second is a switch that routes RIA synaptic output to dorsal or ventral head motor neurons.","10.1523/eneuro.0121-18.2018"

We hypothesized that microbiome structure and function, as described by metagenomics and metaproteomics, would distinguish hotspots from low-activity sediments through a shift towards carbohydrate-utilizing metabolic pathways and elucidate discrete mechanisms governing organic matter processing in each location. We also expected these differences to be reflected in the metabolome, whereby hotspot carbon (C) pools and metabolite transformations therein would be enriched in sugar-associated compounds. In contrast to expectations, we found pronounced phenotypic plasticity in the hyporheic zone microbiome that was denoted by similar microbiome structure, functional potential, and expression across sediments with dissimilar metabolic rates. Instead, diverse nitrogenous metabolites and biochemical transformations characterized hotspots. Metabolomes also corresponded more strongly to aerobic metabolism than bulk C content only (explaining 67% vs. 42% of variation), and bulk C did not improve statistical models based on metabolome composition alone. These results point to organic nitrogen as a significant regulatory factor influencing hyporheic zone organic matter processing.

Voth","The University of Chicago","2018-03-28",1,"15","new results","biophysics","The influenza A matrix 2 (M2) transmembrane protein facilitates virion release from the infected host cell. In particular, M2 plays a role in the induction of membrane curvature and/or in the scission process whereby the envelope is cut upon virion release. Here we show using coarse-grained computer simulations that various M2 assembly geometries emerge due to an entropic driving force, resulting in compact clusters or linearly extended aggregates as a direct consequence of the lateral membrane stresses. Conditions under which these protein assemblies will cause the lipid membrane to curve are explored and we predict that a critical cluster size is required for this to happen. We go on to demonstrate that under the stress conditions taking place in the cellular membrane as it undergoes large-scale membrane remodeling, the M2 protein will in principle be able to both contribute to curvature induction and sense curvature in order to line up in manifolds where local membrane line tension is high. M2 is found to exhibit linactant behavior in liquid-disordered/liquid-ordered phase-separated lipid mixtures and to be excluded from the liquid-ordered phase, in near-quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Our findings support a role for M2 in membrane remodeling during influenza viral budding both as an inducer and a sensor of membrane curvature, and they suggest a mechanism by which localization of M2 can occur as the virion assembles and releases from the host cell, independent of how the membrane curvature is produced.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFor influenza virus to release from the infected host cell, controlled viral budding must finalize with membrane scission of the viral envelope. Curiously, influenza carries its own protein, M2, which can sever the membrane of the constricted budding neck. Here we elucidate the physical mechanism of clustering and spatial localization of the M2 scission proteins through a combined computational and experimental approach. Our results provide fundamental insights into how M2 clustering and localization interplays with membrane curvature, membrane lateral stresses, and lipid bilayer phase behavior during viral budding in order to contribute to virion release.","10.1073/pnas.1805443115"

Misregulation of histone methylation can lead to aberrant gene expression, thereby contributing to abnormal development and diseases such as cancer. As such, the mammalian lysine-specific demethylase 2 (KDM2) homologs, KDM2A and KDM2B, are either oncogenic or tumor suppressive, depending on specific pathological contexts. However, the role of KDM2 proteins during development in the whole organisms remains poorly understood. Unlike vertebrates, Drosophila has only one KDM2 homolog (dKDM2), but its functions in vivo remain elusive due to the complexities of the existing mutant alleles. To address this problem, we have generated two dKdm2 null alleles using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. These dKdm2 homozygous mutants are fully viable and fertile, with no developmental defects observed under laboratory conditions. However, the dKdm2 null mutant adults display defects in circadian rhythms. Most of the dKdm2 mutants become arrhythmic under constant darkness, while the circadian period of the rhythmic mutant flies is approximately one hour shorter than the control. Interestingly, opposite defects are observed when dKDM2 is overexpressed in circadian pacemaker neurons. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dKdm2 is not essential for viability; instead, dKDM2 protein plays important roles in regulating circadian rhythms in Drosophila. Further analyses of the molecular mechanisms of how dKDM2 and its orthologs in vertebrates regulate circadian rhythms will advance our understanding of the epigenetic regulations of circadian clocks.","10.3389/fgene.2018.00354"

A.; Hagen, S. J.","Stephen J Hagen","University of Florida, Physics Department","2018-03-28",1,"15","new results","microbiology","AbstractEntry into genetic competence in streptococci is controlled by ComX, an alternative sigma factor for genes that enable the import of exogenous DNA. In Streptococcus mutans, the immediate activator of comX is the ComRS signaling system, which consists of the cytosolic receptor ComR and the 7-residue signal peptide XIP, which is derived from ComS. Extracellular XIP imported by an oligopeptide permease interacts with ComR to form a transcriptional activator for both comX and comS. Therefore, extracellular XIP can function as an exogenous signal to trigger S. mutans competence. However, the mechanisms that process ComS and export it as XIP are not fully known in S. mutans. The observation that comX is expressed bimodally under some environmental conditions suggests that ComR may also interact with endogenously produced XIP or ComS, creating an intracellular positive feedback loop in comS transcription. Here we use single cell and microfluidic methods to compare the effects of the native comS gene and extracellular XIP on comX expression. We find that deletion of comS reduces the response of comX to extracellular XIP. We also find that comS-overexpressing cells autoactivate their comX even when their growth medium is rapidly exchanged, although this autoactivation requires an intact copy of comS under control of its own promoter. However comS-overexpressing cells do not activate comS-deficient mutants growing in coculture. These data show that individual cells can activate comX without exporting or importing the XIP or ComS signal, and that endogenously and exogenously produced ComS/XIP have inequivalent effects on comX behavior. These data are fully consistent with a model in which intracellular positive feedback in comS transcription plays a role in ComRS signaling, and is responsible for the bimodal expression of comX.\n\nAuthor SummaryHeterogeneous gene expression in genetically identical populations plays an important role in bacterial persistence and survival under changing environmental conditions. In the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans, the physiological state of genetic competence can exhibit bimodality, with only some cells becoming competent. S. mutans controls its entry into competence by using the ComRS signaling system to activate comX, a gene encoding the master competence regulator ComX. The ComRS system is understood as a quorum sensing system, in which the extracellular accumulation of the small signal peptide XIP, derived from ComS, induces comX expression. We coupled observation of bacteria that fluoresce when comX is active with mathematical analysis and chemical binding assays to show that activation of comX does not necessarily require extracellular XIP or ComS, and that comX-active cells do not necessarily export XIP. Our experiments and mathematical modeling indicate that a positive feedback loop in comS transcription allows a cell to activate comX in response to its own XIP or ComS in the absence of extracellular XIP, or to amplify its comX response to extracellular XIP if present. Such positive feedback loops are often the cause of bimodal gene expression like that seen in S. mutans competence.","10.1128/mSphere.00444-18"

C.","Stephen C Ekker","Mayo Clinic","2018-03-28",1,"4","new results","molecular biology","One key problem in precision genome editing is the resultant unpredictable plurality of sequence outcomes at the site of targeted DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This is due to the typical activation of the versatile Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway. Such unpredictability limits the utility of somatic gene editing for applications including gene therapy and functional genomics. For germline editing work, the accurate reproduction of identical alleles using NHEJ is a labor intensive process. In this study, we propose inducing Microhomology-mediated End Joining (MMEJ) as a viable solution for improving somatic sequence homogeneity in vivo, capable of generating a single predictable allele at high rates (56% ~ 86% of the entire mutant allele pool). Using a combined dataset from zebrafish (Danio rerio) in vivo and human HeLa cell in vitro as a training dataset, we identified specific contextual sequence determinants surrounding genomic DSBs for robust MMEJ pathway activation. We then applied our observation and prospectively designed MMEJ-inducing sgRNAs against a variety of proof-of-principle genes and demonstrated a high level of mutant allele homogeneity at these loci. F0 mutant zebrafish embryos and larvae generated with these gRNAs faithfully recapitulated previously reported, recessive loss-of-function phenotypes. We also provide a novel algorithm MENTHU (http://genesculpt.org/menthu/) for improved prediction of candidate MMEJ loci, suitable for both targeted and genome-wide applications. We believe that this MMEJ-centric approach will have a broad impact on genome engineering and its applications. For example, whereas somatic mosaicism hinders efficient recreation of a knockout mutant allele at base pair resolution via the standard NHEJ-based approach, we demonstrate that F0 founders transmitted the identical MMEJ allele of interest at high rates. Most importantly, the ability to directly dictate the reading frame of an endogenous target will have important implications for gene therapy applications in human genetic diseases.\n\nAuthor SummaryNew gene editing tools precisely break DNA at pre-defined genomic locations, but cells repair these lesions using diverse pathways that often lead to unpredictable outcomes in the resulting DNA sequences. This sequence diversity in gene editing outcomes represents an important obstacle to the application of this technology for human therapies. Using a vertebrate animal as a model system, we provide strong evidence that we can overcome this obstacle by selectively directing DNA repair of double-stranded breaks through a lesser-described pathway termed Microhomology-mediated End Joining (MMEJ). Unlike other, better-understood pathways, MMEJ uses recurring short sequence patterns surrounding the site of DNA breakage. This enables the prediction of repair outcomes with improved accuracy. Importantly, we also show that preferential activation of MMEJ is compatible with effective gene editing. Finally, we provide a simple algorithm and software for designing DNA-breaking reagents that have high chance of activating the MMEJ pathway. We believe that the MMEJ-centric approach to be broadly applicable for a variety of gene editing applications both within the laboratory and for human therapies.\n\nAuthor ContributionHA contributed in Conceptualization, Data Curation, Formal Analysis, Investigation, Funding Acquisition, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - Original draft preparation, and Writing - Review and Editing.

This capacity has been documented in numerous behavioral studies that have revealed navigation strategies and the sensory modalities used for navigation. However, virtually nothing is known about how freely swimming fish represent space and locomotion in the brain to enable successful navigation. Using a novel wireless neural recording system, we measured the activity of single neurons in the goldfish lateral pallium, a brain region known to be involved in spatial memory and navigation, while the fish swam freely in a two-dimensional water tank. Four cell types were identified: border cells, head direction cells, speed cells and conjunction head direction with speed. Border cells were active when the fish was near the boundary of the environment. Head direction cells were shown to encode head direction. Speed cells only encoded the absolute speed independent of direction suggestive of an odometry signal. Finally, the conjunction of head direction with speed cells represented the velocity of the fish. This study thus sheds light on how information related to navigation is represented in the brain of swimming fish, and addresses the fundamental question of the neural basis of navigation in this diverse group of vertebrates. The similarities between our observations in fish and earlier findings in mammals may indicate that the networks controlling navigation in vertebrate originate from an ancient circuit common across vertebrates.\n\nSummaryNavigation is a fundamental behavioral capacity facilitating survival in many animal species. Fish is one lineage where navigation has been explored behaviorally, but it remains unclear how freely swimming fish represent space and locomotion in the brain. This is a key open question in our understanding of navigation in fish and more generally in understanding the evolutionary origin of the brains navigation system. To address this issue, we recorded neuronal signals from the brain of freely swimming goldfish and successfully identified representations of border and swimming kinematics in a brain region known to be associated with navigation. Our findings thus provide a glimpse into the building blocks of the neural representation underlying fish navigation. The similarity of the representation in fish with that of mammals may be key evidence supporting a preserved ancient mechanism across brain evolution.","NA"

Intrinsic noises, including those that are caused by low copy number of molecules and transcriptional bursting, are usually studied by stochastic analysis methods, such as Gillespie algorithm and Langevin simulation. However, the role of extrinsic factors, such as cell-to-cell variability and heterogeneity in microenvironment, is still elusive. To evaluate the effects of both intrinsic and extrinsic noises, we develop a new method, named sRACIPE, by integrating stochastic analysis with random circuit perturbation (RACIPE) method. Unlike traditional methods, RACIPE generates and analyzes an ensemble of mathematical models with random kinetic parameters. Previously, we have shown that the gene expression from random models form robust and functionally related clusters. Under the framework of this randomization-based approach, here we develop two stochastic simulation schemes, aiming to reduce the computational cost without sacrificing the convergence of statistics. One scheme uses constant noise to capture the basins of attraction, and the other one uses simulated annealing to detect the stability of states. By testing the methods on several gene regulatory circuits, we found that high noise, but not large parameter variation, merges clusters together. Our approach quantifies the robustness of a gene circuit in the presence of noise and sheds light on a new mechanism of noise induced hybrid states. We have implemented sRACIPE into a freely available R package.","10.1038/s41540-018-0076-x"

To study the role of nuclear IL-33 in IEC, we generated transgenic mice expressing full-length IL-33 in the intestinal epithelium (Vfl33 mice). Expression of full-length IL-33 in the epithelium resulted in accumulation of IL-33 protein in the nucleus and secretion of IL-33. Over-expression of full-length IL-33 by IEC did not promote gut inflammation, but induced expression of genes in the IEC and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) that correlated negatively with genes expressed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Because the IL-33 receptor ST2 is expressed by IEC, there was the potential that both the mature and full-length forms could mediate this effect. To specifically interrogate the transcriptional role of nuclear IL-33, we intercrossed the Vfl33 mice with ST2-deficient mice.

Indeed, drugs that boost synaptic inhibition can disrupt epileptic seizure activity, although these drugs generate complex effects due to the broad nature of their action. Recently developed chemicogenetic techniques provide the opportunity to pharmacologically enhance endogenous inhibitory mechanisms in a more selective manner. Here we use chemicogenetics to assess the anti-epileptic potential of enhancing the synaptic output from three major interneuron populations in the hippocampus: parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing interneurons. Targeted pre- and post-synaptic whole cell recordings in an in vitro hippocampal mouse model revealed that all three interneuron types increase their firing rate and synaptic output following chemicogenetic activation. However, the interneuron populations exhibited different anti-epileptic effects. Recruiting VIP interneurons resulted in a mixture of pro-epileptic and anti-epileptic effects. In contrast, recruiting SST or PV interneurons produced robust suppression of epileptiform activity. PV interneurons exhibited the strongest effect per cell, eliciting at least a five-fold greater reduction in epileptiform activity than the other cell types. Consistent with this, we found that chemicogenetic recruitment of PV interneurons was effective in an in vivo mouse model of hippocampal seizures. Following efficient delivery of the chemicogenetic tool, pharmacological enhancement of the PV interneuron population suppressed a range of seizure-related behaviours and prevented generalized seizures. Our findings therefore support the idea that selective chemicogenetic enhancement of synaptic inhibitory pathways offers potential as an anti-epileptic strategy.\n\nSignificance statementDrugs that enhance synaptic inhibition can be effective anticonvulsants but often cause complex effects due to their widespread action. Here we examined the anti-epileptic potential of recently developed chemicogenetic techniques, which offer a way to selectively enhance the synaptic output of distinct types of inhibitory neurons. A combination of in vitro and in vivo experimental models were used to investigate seizure activity in the mouse hippocampus. We find that chemicogenetically recruiting the parvalbumin-expressing population of inhibitory neurons produces the strongest anti-epileptic effect per cell, and that recruiting this cell population can suppress a range of epileptic behaviours in vivo. The data therefore support the idea that targeted chemicogenetic enhancement of synaptic inhibition offers promise for developing new treatments.","10.3389/fncel.2018.00293"

On the contrary the software written for epidemiology is monolithic, highly coupled and severely heterogeneous. This reality ultimately makes these computational models hard to study and to reuse, both because of the programming competence required and because of the incompatibility of the different approaches involved. Our goal with Kendrick is to simplify the creation of epidemiological models through a unified Domain-Specific Language for epidemiology that can support a variety of modelling and simulation approaches classically used in the field. This goal can be achieved by promoting reproducibility and reuse with modular modelling abstractions.\n\nResultsWe show through several examples how our modular abstractions and tools can reproduce uniformly complex mathematical and computational models of epidemics, despite being simulated by different methods. This is achieved without requiring sophisticated programming skills from the part of the user. We then successfully validate each kind of simulation through statistical analysis between the time series generated and the known theoretical expectations.\n\nConclusionsKendrick is one of the few DSLs for epidemiology that does not burden its users with implementation details or expecting sophisticated programming skills.

The NDB uses two types of personal identification variables (referred to in the database as \""ID1\"" and \""ID2\"") to link the insurance claims of individual patients. However, the information entered against these ID variables is prone to change for several reasons, such as when claimants find or change employment, or due to variations in the spelling of their name. In the present study, we developed a new patient-matching technique that improves upon the existing system of using ID1 and ID2 variables. We also sought to validate a new personal ID variable (ID0) that we propose in order to enhance the efficiency of patient matching in the NDB database.\n\nMethodsOur study targeted data from health insurance claims filed between April 2013 and March 2016 for hospitalization, combined diagnostic procedures, outpatient treatment, and dispensing of prescription medication. We developed a new patient-matching algorithm based on the ID1 and ID2 variables, as well as variables for treatment date and clinical outcome. We then attempted to validate our algorithm by comparing the number of patients identified by patient matching with the current ID1 variable and our proposed ID0 variable against the estimated patient population as of 1 October 2015.\n\nResultsThe numbers of patients in each sex and age group that were identified with the ID0 variable were lower than those identified using the ID1 variable. By using the ID0 variable, we were able to reduce the number of duplicate records for male and female patients by 5.8% and 6.4%, respectively. The numbers of children, adults older than 75 years, and women of reproductive age identified using the ID1 patient-matching variable were all higher than their corresponding estimates. Conversely, the numbers of these patients identified with the ID0 patient-matching variable were all within their corresponding estimates.\n\nConclusionOur findings show that the proposed ID0 variable delivers more precise patient-matching results than the existing ID1 variable. The ID0 variable is currently the best available technique for patient matching in the NDB database. Future patient population estimates should therefore rely on the ID0 variable instead of the ID1 variable.","NA"

The advent of scalable somatic cell genetic technologies creates the opportunity to functionally map these essential pathways, thereby identifying potential disease-relevant components. We investigated the genetic basis underlying necroptotic cell death by performing a complementary set of loss- and gain-of-function genetic screens. To this end, we established FADD-deficient haploid human KBM7 cells, which specifically and efficiently undergo necroptosis after a single treatment with either TNF or the SMAC mimetic compound birinapant. A series of unbiased gene-trap screens identified key signaling mediators, such as TNFR1, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL. Among the novel components, we focused on the zinc transporter SLC39A7, whose knock-out led to necroptosis resistance by affecting TNF receptor trafficking and ER homeostasis. Orthogonal, solute carrier (SLC)-focused CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screens revealed the exquisite specificity of SLC39A7, among ~ 400 SLC genes, for TNFR1- and FAS-but not TRAIL-R1-mediated responses. The newly established cellular model also allowed genome-wide gain-of-function screening for genes conferring resistance to necroptosis via the CRISPR/Cas9 synergistic activation mediator approach. Among these, we found cIAP1 and cIAP2, and characterized the role of TNIP1 (TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1), which prevented pathway activation in a ubiquitin-binding dependent manner. Altogether, the gain- and loss-of-function screens described here provide a global genetic chart of the molecular factors involved in necroptosis and death receptor signaling, prompting investigation of their individual contribution and potential role in pathological conditions.","10.1038/s41418-018-0192-6"

Representational Similarity Analysis showed visual information was represented in alpha activity throughout the VVP, and semantic information was represented in theta activity. Furthermore, informational connectivity showed visual information travels through feedforward connections, while visual information is transformed into semantic representations through feedforward and feedback activity, centered on the anterior temporal lobe.

TrackSig uses probability distributions over mutation types, called mutational signatures, to represent different mutational processes and detects the changes in the signature activity using an optimal segmentation algorithm that groups somatic mutations based on their estimated cancer cellular fraction (CCF) and their mutation type (e.g. CAG->CTG). We use two different simulation frameworks to assess both TrackSigs reconstruction accuracy and its robustness to violations of its assumptions, as well as to compare it to a baseline approach. We find 2-4% median error in reconstructing the signature activities on simulations with varying difficulty with one to three subclones at an average depth of 30x. The size and the direction of the activity change is consistent in 83% and 95% of cases respectively. There were an average of 0.02 missed and 0.12 false positive subclones per sample.

C.","Christiane Ahlheim","University College London","2018-03-29",4,"1","new results","neuroscience","Recent advances in multivariate fMRI analysis stress the importance of information inherent to voxel patterns. Key to interpreting these patterns is estimating the underlying dimensionality of neural representations. Dimensions may correspond to psychological dimensions, such as length and orientation, or involve other coding schemes. Unfortunately, the noise structure of fMRI data inflates dimensionality estimates and thus makes it difficult to assess the true underlying dimensionality of a pattern. To address this challenge, we developed a novel approach to identify brain regions that carry reliable task-modulated signal and to derive an estimate of the signals functional dimensionality. We combined singular value decomposition with cross-validation to find the best low-dimensional projection of a pattern of voxel-responses at a single-subject level. Goodness of the low-dimensional reconstruction is measured as Pearson correlation with a test set, which allows to test for significance of the low-dimensional reconstruction across participants. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we derive the best estimate and associated uncertainty of underlying dimensionality across participants. We validated our method on simulated data of varying underlying dimensionality, showing that recovered dimensionalities match closely true dimensionalities. We then applied our method to three published fMRI data sets all involving processing of visual stimuli. The results highlight three possible applications of estimating the functional dimensionality of neural data. Firstly, it can aid evaluation of model-based analyses by revealing which areas express reliable, task-modulated signal that could be missed by specific models. Secondly, it can reveal functional differences across brain regions. Thirdly, knowing the functional dimensionality allows assessing task-related differences in the complexity of neural patterns.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.06.015"

Despite this, transcriptomic analyses of the human brain have typically been conducted using macro-dissected tissue due to the difficulty of performing single-cell type analyses with donated post-mortem brains. To address this issue statistically, we compiled a database of several thousand transcripts that were specifically-enriched in one of 10 primary cortical cell types in previous publications. Using this database, we predicted the relative cell type composition for 833 human cortical samples using microarray or RNA-Seq data from the Pritzker Consortium (GSE92538) or publicly-available databases (GSE53987, GSE21935, GSE21138, CommonMind Consortium). These predictions were generated by averaging normalized expression levels across transcripts specific to each cell type using our R-package BrainInABlender (validated and publicly-released: https://github.com/hagenaue/BrainInABlender). Using this method, we found that the principal components of variation in the datasets strongly correlated with the neuron to glia ratio of the samples.\n\nThis variability was not simply due to dissection - the relative balance of brain cell types appeared to be influenced by a variety of demographic, pre- and post-mortem variables. Prolonged hypoxia around the time of death predicted increased astrocytic and endothelial gene expression, illustrating vascular upregulation. Aging was associated with decreased neuronal gene expression. Red blood cell gene expression was reduced in individuals who died following systemic blood loss. Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder had decreased astrocytic gene expression, mirroring previous morphometric observations. Subjects with Schizophrenia had reduced red blood cell gene expression, resembling the hypofrontality detected in fMRI experiments. Finally, in datasets containing samples with especially variable cell content, we found that controlling for predicted sample cell content while evaluating differential expression improved the detection of previously-identified psychiatric effects. We conclude that accounting for cell type can greatly improve the interpretability of transcriptomic data.","10.1371/journal.pone.0200003"

Preoperative MRI included anatomical, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and chemical shift imaging (CSI). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were calculated from DTI and DSC respectively. Using thresholding methods, two low perfusion compartments (ADCH-rCBVL and ADCL-rCBVL) were identified. Volumetric analysis was performed. Lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels were determined from multivoxel spectroscopy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses.\n\nResultsTwo compartments displayed higher lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels than normal controls (each P < 0.001), suggesting hypoxic and pro-inflammatory microenvironment. The proportional volume of ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a larger infiltration area (P < 0.001, rho = 0.42). Lower lactate in this compartment was associated with a less invasive phenotype visualized on DTI. Multivariate Cox regression showed higher lactate level in the ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a worse survival (PFS: HR 2.995, P = 0.047; OS: HR 4.974, P = 0.005).\n\nConclusionsThe ADCL-rCBVL compartment represent a treatment resistant sub-region associated with glioblastoma invasiveness.

In contrast to available analytical methods, anota2seq also allows capture of an underappreciated mode for regulation of gene expression whereby translation acts as a buffering mechanism which maintains constant protein levels despite fluctuations in mRNA levels (\""translational buffering\""). Application of anota2seq shows that insulin affects gene expression at multiple levels, in a largely mTOR-dependent manner.

These principles include both modularity and clear separation of concerns that can promote reproducibility and reusability by other researchers. On the contrary the software written for epidemiology is monolithic, highly coupled and severely heterogeneous. This reality ultimately makes these computational models hard to study and to reuse, both because of the programming competence required and because of the incompatibility of the different approaches involved. Our goal with Kendrick is to simplify the creation of epidemiological models through a unified Domain-Specific Language for epidemiology that can support a variety of modelling and simulation approaches classically used in the field. This goal can be achieved by promoting reproducibility and reuse with modular modelling abstractions.\n\nResultsWe show through several examples how our modular abstractions and tools can reproduce uniformly complex mathematical and computational models of epidemics, despite being simulated by different methods. This is achieved without requiring sophisticated programming skills from the part of the user. We then successfully validate each kind of simulation through statistical analysis between the time series generated and the known theoretical expectations.\n\nConclusionsKendrick is one of the few DSLs for epidemiology that does not burden its users with implementation details or expecting sophisticated programming skills.

The specimens we studied were preserved in different ways (in ethanol, air dried, and as an endocast in amber), demonstrating that our method provides a new opportunity to quantitatively study and compare the vision of a wide range insects held in museum collections. Our analysis indicates that different visual specializations have evolved between fungus gnat species living in different forest types and that the eyes of gnats from a similar geographic location have evolved to match the changing environmental conditions. Despite the small size of fungus gnats, evolution has evidentially been able to exploit sensory specializations to meet the differing sensory demands of species from a variety of forest habitats.\n\nSignificance statementDo insects have visual specializations that evolve with changes in their environment? To answer this question, a novel analysis technique is described that uses 3D imaging and simulations to compare the vision of ancient amber-embedded insects to those of their extant relatives. This study investigated the vision of fungus gnats to understand how tiny insects use vision to negotiate forests, some of the worlds most visually complex environments. Despite being amongst the smallest of any flying insect, the gnats miniature eyes have evolved visual specializations specifically adapted for different forest types, allowing different species to meet their visual demands of their specific habitats.","10.1098/rsif.2019.0750"

The extent to which increased X-chromosome dosage (X-dosage) in female iPSCs leads to differences in the molecular and cellular properties of XX and XY iPSCs is still unclear.

To understand the mechanisms by which increased X-dosage modulates the molecular and cellular properties of mouse pluripotent stem cells, we used heterozygous deletions of the X-linked gene Dusp9 in XX embryonic stem cells. We show that X-dosage regulates the transcriptome, open chromatin landscape, growth and pluripotency exit largely independently of global DNA methylation.

Cooke","Radboud University","2018-03-29",3,"4","new results","neuroscience","Comparing models facilitates testing different hypotheses regarding the computational basis of perception and action. Effective model comparison requires stimuli for which models make different predictions. Typically, experiments use a predetermined set of stimuli or sample stimuli randomly. Both methods have limitations; a predetermined set may not contain stimuli that dissociate the models whereas random sampling may be inefficient. To overcome these limitations, we expanded the psi-algorithm (Kontsevich & Tyler, 1999) from estimating the parameters of a psychometric curve to distinguishing models. To test our algorithm, we applied it to two distinct problems. First, we investigated dissociating sensory noise models. We simulated ideal observers with different noise models performing a 2-afc task. Stimuli were selected randomly or using our algorithm. We found using our algorithm improved the accuracy of model comparison. We also validated the algorithm in subjects by inferring which noise model underlies speed perception. Our algorithm converged quickly to the model previously proposed (Stocker & Simoncelli, 2006), whereas if stimuli were selected randomly model probabilities separated slower and sometimes supported alternative models. Second, we applied our algorithm to a different problem; comparing models of target selection under body acceleration. Previous work found target choice preference is modulated by whole body acceleration (Rincon-Gonzalez et al., 2016). However, the effect is subtle making model comparison difficult. We show that selecting stimuli adaptively could have led to stronger conclusions in model comparison. We conclude that our technique is more efficient and more reliable than current methods of stimulus selection for dissociating models.\n\nData AvailabilityAll data and code will be posted on our institutional repository system following acceptance.

Rich-clubs, highly interconnected sets of neurons, are known to propagate a disproportionate amount of information within cortical circuits. Here, we test the hypothesis that rich-clubs also perform a disproportionate amount of computation. To do so, we recorded the spiking activity of on average [~]300 well-isolated individual neurons from organotypic cortical cultures. We then constructed weighted, directed networks reflecting the effective connectivity between the neurons. For each neuron, we quantified the amount of computation it performed based on its inputs. We found that rich-club neurons compute [~]200% more information than neurons outside of the rich club. Indeed, the amount of computation performed in the rich-club was proportional to the amount information propagation by the same neurons. This suggests that, in these circuits, information propagation drives computation. Comparing the computation-to-propagation ratio inside versus outside of the rich club showed that rich clubs compute at a slightly, though significantly, reduced level ([~]4% lower). In total, our findings indicate that rich club topology in effective cortical circuits supports not only information propagation but also neural computation.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHere we answer the question of whether rich club topology in functional cortical circuits supports neural computation as it has been previously shown to do for information propagation. To do so, we combined network analysis with information theoretic tools to analyze the spiking activity of hundreds of neurons recorded from organotypic cultures of mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that neurons in rich clubs computed significantly more than neurons outside of rich clubs, suggesting that rich-clubs do support computation in cortical circuits.

A striking example of branching occurs in humans around the time of implantation, when primordial germ cells (PGCs), precursors of sperm and eggs, and somatic lineages are specified. Due to inaccessibility of human embryos at this stage of development, understanding the mechanisms of PGC specification remains difficult. The integrative modelling of single cell transcriptomics data from embryos and appropriate in vitro models should prove to be a useful resource for investigating this system, provided that the cells can be suitably ordered over a developmental axis. Unfortunately, most methods for inferring cell ordering were not designed with structured (time series) data in mind. Although some probabilistic approaches address these limitations by incorporating prior information about the developmental stage (capture time) of the cell, they do not allow the ordering of cells over processes with more than one terminal cell fate. To investigate the mechanisms of PGC specification, we develop a probabilistic pseudotime approach, branch-recombinant Gaussian process latent variable models (B-RGPLVMs), that use an explicit model of transcriptional branching in individual marker genes, allowing the ordering of cells over developmental trajectories with arbitrary numbers of branches. We use first demonstrate the advantage of our approach over existing pseudotime algorithms and subsequently use it to investigate early human development, as primordial germ cells (PGCs) and somatic cells diverge. We identify known master regulators of human PGCs, and predict roles for a variety of signalling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifiers. By concentrating on the earliest branched signalling events, we identified an antagonistic role for FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway in the acquisition of competence for human PGC fate, and identify putative roles for PRC1 and PRC2 in PGC specification. We experimentally validate our predictions using pharmacological blocking of FGFR or its downstream effectors (MEK, PI3K and JAK), and demonstrate enhanced competency for PGC fate in vitro, whilst small molecule inhibition of the enzymatic component of PRC1/PRC2 reveals reduced capacity of cells to form PGCs in vitro. Thus, B-RGPLVMs represent a powerful and flexible data-driven approach for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cell fate decisions, providing unique insights into the mechanisms of early embryogenesis.

Because these organisms and their traits directly impact ecosystems and human health, a focus on functional traits has become increasingly common in microbial ecology. These trait-based approaches have the potential to link microbial communities and their ecological function. But an open question is how, why, and in what order microorganisms acquired the traits we observe in the present day. To address this, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of microbial traits using genomic data to understand the evolution, selective advantage, and similarity of traits in extant organisms and provide insights into the composition of genomes and communities. We used the geological timeline and physiological expectations to provide independent evidence in support of this evolutionary history. Using this reconstructed evolutionary history, we explored hypotheses related to the composition of genomes. We showed that gene transition rates can be used to make predictions about the size and type of genes in a genome: generalist genomes comprise many evolutionarily labile genes while specialist genomes comprise more highly conserved functional genes. These findings suggest that generalist organisms do not build up and hoard an array of functions, but rather tend to experiment with functions related to environmental sensing, transport, and complex resource degradation. Our results provide a framework for understanding the evolutionary history of extant microorganisms, the origin and maintenanceof traits, and linking evolutionary relatedness and ecological function.","NA"

Indeed, drugs that boost synaptic inhibition can disrupt epileptic seizure activity, although these drugs generate complex effects due to the broad nature of their action. Recently developed chemicogenetic techniques provide the opportunity to pharmacologically enhance endogenous inhibitory mechanisms in a more selective manner. Here we use chemicogenetics to assess the anti-epileptic potential of enhancing the synaptic output from three major interneuron populations in the hippocampus: parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing interneurons. Targeted pre- and post-synaptic whole cell recordings in an in vitro hippocampal mouse model revealed that all three interneuron types increase their firing rate and synaptic output following chemicogenetic activation. However, the interneuron populations exhibited different anti-epileptic effects. Recruiting VIP interneurons resulted in a mixture of pro-epileptic and anti-epileptic effects. In contrast, recruiting SST or PV interneurons produced robust suppression of epileptiform activity. PV interneurons exhibited the strongest effect per cell, eliciting at least a five-fold greater reduction in epileptiform activity than the other cell types. Consistent with this, we found that chemicogenetic recruitment of PV interneurons was effective in an in vivo mouse model of hippocampal seizures. Following efficient delivery of the chemicogenetic tool, pharmacological enhancement of the PV interneuron population suppressed a range of seizure-related behaviours and prevented generalized seizures. Our findings therefore support the idea that selective chemicogenetic enhancement of synaptic inhibitory pathways offers potential as an anti-epileptic strategy.\n\nSignificance statementDrugs that enhance synaptic inhibition can be effective anticonvulsants but often cause complex effects due to their widespread action. Here we examined the anti-epileptic potential of recently developed chemicogenetic techniques, which offer a way to selectively enhance the synaptic output of distinct types of inhibitory neurons.

We find that chemicogenetically recruiting the parvalbumin-expressing population of inhibitory neurons produces the strongest anti-epileptic effect per cell, and that recruiting this cell population can suppress a range of epileptic behaviours in vivo.

Recent studies have nevertheless shown that the X to autosome expression ratio equals ~1 in haploid human parthenogenetic embryonic stem (pES) cells and ~0.5 in diploid pES cells, thus refuting Ohnos hypothesis. Here, by reanalyzing a RNA-seq-based single-cell transcriptome dataset of human embryos (Petropoulos, et al. 2016), we found that from the 8-cell stage until the time-point just prior to implantation, the expression levels of X-linked genes are not two-fold upregulated in male cells and gradually decrease from two-fold in female cells. This observation suggests that the expression levels of X-linked genes are imbalanced, with autosomal genes starting from the early 8-cell stage, and that the dosage conversion is fast, such that the X:AA expression ratio reaches ~0.5 in no more than a week. Additional analyses of gene expression noise further suggest that the dosage sensitivity of X-linked genes is weaker than that of autosomal genes in differentiated female cells, which contradicts a key assumption of Ohnos hypothesis. Moreover, the dosage-sensitive housekeeping genes are preferentially located on autosomes, implying selection against X-linkage for dosage-sensitive genes. Our results collectively suggest an alternative to Ohnos hypothesis that X-linked genes are less likely to be dosage sensitive than autosomal genes.","10.1186/s12864-019-5432-8"

This data avalanche is particularly challenging in metagenetics, which focuses on taxonomic identification of sequences obtained from diverse microbial environments. To achieve this, phylogenetic placement methods determine how these sequences fit into an evolutionary context. Previous implementations of phylogenetic placement algorithms, such as the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm (EPA) included in RAxML, or O_SCPLOWPPLACERC_SCPLOW, are being increasingly used for this purpose. However, due to the steady progress in NGS technologies, the current implementations face substantial scalability limitations. Here we present EPA-O_SCPLOWNGC_SCPLOW, a complete reimplementation of the EPA that is substantially faster, offers a distributed memory parallelization, and integrates concepts from both, RAxML-EPA, and O_SCPLOWPPLACERC_SCPLOW. EPA-O_SCPLOWNGC_SCPLOW can be executed on standard shared memory, as well as on distributed memory systems (e.g., computing clusters). To demonstrate the scalability of EPA-O_SCPLOWNGC_SCPLOW we placed 1 billion metagenetic reads from the Tara Oceans Project onto a reference tree with 3,748 taxa in just under 7 hours, using 2,048 cores. Our performance assessment shows that EPA-O_SCPLOWNGC_SCPLOW outperforms RAxML-EPA and O_SCPLOWPPLACERC_SCPLOW by up to a factor of 30 in sequential execution mode, while attaining comparable parallel efficiency on shared memory systems. We further show that the distributed memory parallelization of EPA-O_SCPLOWNGC_SCPLOW scales well up to 3,520 cores.

Here, we present a novel statistical-physics-based model uniquely constructed from conformational states deduced from existing tubulin structures, with transitions between them controlled by steric constraints and mechanical energy of the microtubule lattice. This mechano-chemical model allows, for the first time, all the key phenomena of dynamic instability to be coherently reproduced by the corresponding kinetic simulations. Long-puzzling phenomena, such as aging, small GTP-cap size, fast catastrophe upon dilution and temperature-induced ribbon-to-tube transition of GMPCPP-tubulins, robustly emerge and thus can be understood with confidence.","NA"

The genome assembly for the conifer Norway spruce (Picea abies) was the first published draft genome assembly for any gymnosperm. Our goal was to develop a dense set of genome-wide SNP markers for Norway spruce to be used for assembly improvement and population studies. From 80,000 initial probe candidates, we developed two partially-overlapping sets of sequence capture probes: one developed against 56 haploid megagametophytes, to aid assembly improvement; and the other developed against 6 diploid needle samples, to aid population studies. We focused probe development within genes, as delineated via the annotation of ~67,000 gene models accompanying P. abies assembly version 1.0. The 31,277 probes developed against megagametophytes covered 19,268 gene models (mean 1.62 probes/model). The 40,018 probes developed against diploid tissue covered 26,219 gene modules (mean 1.53 probes/model). Analysis of read coverage and variant quality around probe sites showed that initial alignment of captured reads should be done against the whole genome sequence, rather than a subset of probe-containing scaffolds, to overcome occasional capture of sequences outside of designed regions.

Application of in vivo tractography to the neuroanatomical study of the ILF has generally confirmed its existence, however consensus is lacking regarding its subdivision, laterality and connectivity. Further, there is a paucity of detailed neuroanatomic data pertaining to the exact anatomy of the ILF. Generalized Q-Sampling imaging (GQI) is a non-tensor tractographic modality permitting high resolution imaging of white-matter structures. As it is a non-tensor modality, it permits visualization of crossing fibers and accurate delineation of close-proximity fiber-systems. We applied deterministic GQI tractography to data from 30 healthy subjects and a large-volume diffusion atlas, to delineate ILF anatomy. Post-mortem white matter dissection was also carried out in a cadaveric specimen for further validation. The ILF was found in all 60 hemispheres. At its occipital extremity, it demonstrated a trifurcated termination pattern which was used to separate the ILF into 3 distinct sub-fascicles: Dorsolateral, ventrolateral and ventromedial. These divisions were consistent across the subject set and within the atlas. We applied quantitative techniques to study connectivity strength of the ILF at its anterior and posterior extremities. Overall, the 3 sub-fascicles, and the whole ILF, demonstrated strong leftward-lateralized connectivity patterns. Leftward-lateralization was also found for ILF volumes across the subject set. Due to connective and volumetric leftward-dominance and ventral location, we postulate the ILFs role in the semantic system. Further, our results are in agreement with functional and lesion-based postulations pertaining to the ILFs role in facial recognition.","10.3389/fnana.2018.00047"

Although previous work, including our own, demonstrates that some animals will sacrifice juice rewards for information, that information normally predicts upcoming rewards and their ostensible curiosity may therefore be a byproduct of reinforcement processes.

A.","Christopher A Penfold","University of Cambridge","2018-03-29",1,"4","new results","bioinformatics","MotivationA common class of behaviour encountered in the biological sciences involves branching and recombination. During branching, a statistical process bifurcates resulting in two or more potentially correlated processes that may under-go further branching; the contrary is true during recombination, where two or more statistical processes converge into one. A key objective is to identify the time of this bifurcation (branch time) from time series measurements e.g., comparing a control time series with a perturbed time series. Whilst statistical treatments for the two branch (control versus treatment) case exists, the ability to infer more complex branching structure from time series data remains open. Gaussian processes (GPs) represents an ideal framework for such analysis, allowing for nonlinear regression that includes a rigorous treatment of uncertainty. Currently, however, GP models only exist for two-branch systems. Here we highlight how arbitrarily complex branching processes can be built using the correct composition of covariance functions within a GP framework, thus outlining a general framework for the treatment of branching and recombination in the form of branch-recombinant Gaussian processes (B-RGPs). We first demonstrate the performance of B-RGPs compared to a variety of existing regression approaches, and demonstrate robustness to model misspecification. B-RGPs are then used to investigate the branching patterns of Arabidopsis thaliana gene expression following inoculation with the hemibotrophic bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, and a disarmed mutant strain, hrpA. By grouping genes according to the number of branches, we could naturally separate out genes involved in basal immune response from those subverted by the virulent strain, and show enrichment for targets of pathogen protein effectors. Finally, we identify two early branching genes WRKY11 and WRKY17, and showed that groups of genes that branched at similar times to WRKY11/17 were enriched for W-box binding motifs, and overrepresented for genes differentially expressed in WRKY11/17 knockouts, suggesting that branch time could be used for identifying direct and indirect binding targets of key transcription factors.

The advent of scalable somatic cell genetic technologies creates the opportunity to functionally map these essential pathways, thereby identifying potential disease-relevant components. We investigated the genetic basis underlying necroptotic cell death by performing a complementary set of loss- and gain-of-function genetic screens. To this end, we established FADD-deficient haploid human KBM7 cells, which specifically and efficiently undergo necroptosis after a single treatment with either TNF or the SMAC mimetic compound birinapant. A series of unbiased gene-trap screens identified key signaling mediators, such as TNFR1, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL. Among the novel components, we focused on the zinc transporter SLC39A7, whose knock-out led to necroptosis resistance by affecting TNF receptor trafficking and ER homeostasis. Orthogonal, solute carrier (SLC)-focused CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screens revealed the exquisite specificity of SLC39A7, among ~ 400 SLC genes, for TNFR1- and FAS-but not TRAIL-R1-mediated responses. The newly established cellular model also allowed genome-wide gain-of-function screening for genes conferring resistance to necroptosis via the CRISPR/Cas9 synergistic activation mediator approach. Among these, we found cIAP1 and cIAP2, and characterized the role of TNIP1 (TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1), which prevented pathway activation in a ubiquitin-binding dependent manner. Altogether, the gain- and loss-of-function screens described here provide a global genetic chart of the molecular factors involved in necroptosis and death receptor signaling, prompting investigation of their individual contribution and potential role in pathological conditions.","10.1038/s41418-018-0192-6"

To evaluate the efficacy of these interventions, it will be critical to determine Wolbachia infection frequencies in Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. However, current diagnostic tools are not well-suited to fit this need. Morphological methods cannot identify Wolbachia, immunoassays often suffer from low sensitivity and poor throughput, while PCR and spectroscopy require complex instruments and technical expertise, which restrict their use to centralized laboratories. To address this unmet need, we have used loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes to create a one-pot sample-to-answer nucleic acid diagnostic platform for vector and symbiont surveillance. LAMP-OSD assays can directly amplify target nucleic acids from macerated mosquitoes without requiring nucleic acid purification and yield specific single endpoint yes/no fluorescence signals that are observable to eye or by cellphone camera. We demonstrate cellphone-imaged LAMP-OSD tests for two targets, the Aedes aegypti cytochrome oxidase I (coi) gene and the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene, and show a limit of detection of 4 and 40 target DNA copies, respectively. In a blinded test of 90 field-caught mosquitoes, the coi LAMP-OSD assay demonstrated 98% specificity and 97% sensitivity in identifying Ae. aegypti mosquitoes even after 3 weeks of storage without desiccant at 37 {degrees}C. Similarly, the wsp LAMP-OSD assay readily identified the wAlbB Wolbachia strain in field-collected Aedes albopictus mosquitoes without generating any false positive signals. Modest technology requirements, minimal execution steps, simple binary readout, and robust accuracy make the LAMP-OSD-to-cellphone assay platform well suited for field vector surveillance in austere or resource-limited conditions.\n\nAuthor summaryMosquitoes spread many human pathogens and novel approaches are required to reduce the burden of mosquito-borne disease. One promising approach is transferring Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes where it blocks transmission of arboviruses like dengue, Zika and Yellow fever viruses and spreads through mosquito populations. For effective evaluation of this approach, regular surveillance of Wolbachia infections in Ae. aegypti is required, but current diagnostic tools are not well suited to support these critical surveillance needs. To fill this need we developed a simple, robust and inexpensive assay to identify Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and Wolbachia using our unique one-pot assay platform, LAMP-OSD, which uses loop-mediated isothermal amplification to amplify nucleic acid targets at a single temperature. Unlike other LAMP-based tests, our assays assure accuracy by coupling amplification with novel nucleic acid strand displacement (OSD) probes that hybridize to specific sequences in LAMP amplification products and thereby generate simple yes/no readout of fluorescence readable by human eye and by off-the-shelf cellphones. To facilitate field use, we developed our assays so they are compatible with crushed mosquito homogenate as the template, meaning no nucleic acid extraction is required. In blinded tests using field collected mosquitoes, LAMP-OSD-cellphone tests performed robustly to identify 29 of 30 Ae. aegypti even after 3 weeks of storage at 37 {degrees}C while producing only one false positive out of 60 non-specific mosquitoes. Similarly, our assay could identify Wolbachia in field-caught Aedes albopictus without producing any false positives. Our easy to use and easy to interpret assays should facilitate widespread field mosquito surveillance with minimal instrumentation and high accuracy.","10.1371/journal.pntd.0006671"

C.","Emma C Johnson","Washington University School of Medicine","2018-03-29",1,"4","new results","genetics","Inbreeding increases the risk of certain Mendelian disorders in humans but may also reduce fitness through its effects on complex traits and diseases. Such inbreeding depression is thought to occur due to increased homozygosity at causal variants that are recessive with respect to fitness. Until recently it has been difficult to amass large enough sample sizes to investigate the effects of inbreeding depression on complex traits using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in population-based samples. Further, it is difficult to infer causation in analyses that relate degree of inbreeding to complex traits because confounding variables (e.g., education) may influence both the likelihood for parents to outbreed and offspring trait values. The present study used runs of homozygosity in genome-wide SNP data in up to 400,000 individuals in the UK Biobank to estimate the proportion of the autosome that exists in autozygous tracts--stretches of the genome which are identical due to a shared common ancestor. After multiple testing corrections and controlling for possible sociodemographic confounders, we found significant relationships in the predicted direction between estimated autozygosity and three of the 26 traits we investigated: age at first sexual intercourse, fluid intelligence, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Our findings for fluid intelligence and forced expiratory volume corroborate those of several published studies while the finding for age at first sexual intercourse was novel. These results may suggest that these traits have been associated with Darwinian fitness over evolutionary time, although there are other possible explanations for these associations that cannot be eliminated. Some of the autozygosity-trait relationships were attenuated after controlling for background sociodemographic characteristics, suggesting that care needs to be taken in the design and interpretation of ROH studies in order to glean reliable information about the genetic architecture and evolutionary history of complex traits.\n\nAuthor SummaryInbreeding is well known to increase the risk of rare, monogenic diseases, and there has been some evidence that it also affects complex traits, such as cognition and educational attainment. However, difficulties can arise when inferring causation in these types of analyses because of the potential for confounding variables (e.g., socioeconomic status) to bias the observed relationships between distant inbreeding and complex traits. In this investigation, we used single-nucleotide polymorphism data in a very large (N > 400,000) sample of seemingly outbred individuals to quantify the degree to which distant inbreeding is associated with 26 complex traits. We found robust evidence that distant inbreeding is inversely associated with fluid intelligence and a measure of lung function, and is positively associated with age at first sex, while other trait associations with inbreeding were attenuated after controlling for background sociodemographic characteristics. Our findings are consistent with evolutionary predictions that fluid intelligence, lung function, and age at first sex have been under selection pressures over time; however, they also suggest that confounding variables must be accounted for in order to reliably interpret results from these types of analyses.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007556"

AbstractSynaptic vesicles (SVs) are a key component of neuronal signaling and fulfil different roles depending on their composition. In electron micrograms of neurites, two types of vesicles can be distinguished by morphological criteria, the classical \""clear core\"" vesicles (CCV) and the typically larger \""dense core\"" vesicles (DCV), with differences in electron density due to their diverse cargos. Compared to CCVs, the precise function of DCVs is less defined. DCVs are known to store neuropeptides, which function as neuronal messengers and modulators [1]. In C. elegans, they play a role in locomotion, dauer formation, egg-laying, and mechano- and chemosensation [2]. Another type of DCVs, also referred to as granulated vesicles, are known to transport Bassoon, Piccolo and further constituents of the presynaptic density in the center of the active zone (AZ), and therefore are important for synaptogenesis [3].\n\nTo better understand the role of different types of SVs, we present here a new automated approach to classify vesicles. We combine machine learning with an extension of our previously developed vesicle segmentation workflow, the ImageJ macro 3D ART VeSElecT. With that we reliably distinguish CCVs and DCVs in electron tomograms of C. elegans NMJs using image-based features. Analysis of the underlying ground truth data shows an increased fraction of DCVs as well as a higher mean distance between DCVs and AZs in dauer larvae compared to young adult hermaphrodites. Our machine learning based tools are adaptable and can be applied to study properties of different synaptic vesicle pools in electron tomograms of diverse model organisms.\n\n2. Author summaryVesicles are important components of the cell, and synaptic vesicles are central for neuronal signaling. Two types of synaptic vesicles can be distinguished by electron microscopy: the classical \""clear core\"" vesicles (CCVs) and the typically larger \""dense core\"" vesicles (DCVs). The distinct appearance of vesicles is caused by their different cargos. To rapidly distinguish between both vesicle types, we present here a new automated approach to classify vesicles in electron tomograms. We combine machine learning with an extension of our previously developed vesicle segmentation workflow, an ImageJ macro, to reliably distinguish CCVs and DCVs using specific image-based features. The approach was trained and validated using data-sets that were hand curated by microscopy experts. Our technique can be transferred to more extensive comparisons in both stages as well as to other neurobiology questions regarding synaptic vesicles.","10.1371/journal.pone.0205348"

The diauxic shift of Escherichia coli, growing first on glucose and, after it is exhausted, on acetate, is still today actively studied. As a fundamental example of metabolic adaptation, we are interested in understanding if diauxie in monocultures of E. coli is a coordinated and uniform metabolic shift, or rather the observable emergent result of individual sub-populations behavior. To do so we first develop a modeling framework that integrates dynamic models (ordinary differential equation systems) with structural models (metabolic networks), providing an open source modeling framework that is suitable to investigate the dynamics of microbial communities. We apply our methods to model E. coli either as having an average, unique metabolic state or as being the combination of two E. coli populations adapted to one of the two carbon sources. Our results are in strong agreement with previously published data and suggest that rather than a coordinated metabolic shift, diauxie could be the emergent pattern resulting from a survival strategy where individual cells differentiate for optimal growth on different substrates in view of environmental fluctuations. This work offers a new perspective on how to use dynamic metabolic modeling to investigate population dynamics, as the proposed approach can be easily transfered to studies on other multi-species communities as well as single cells.\n\nImportanceEscherichia coli diauxie is a fundamental example of metabolic adaptation that has not yet been completely understood, and to this aim approaches integrating experimental and theoretical biology are needed. We present a novel dynamic metabolic modeling approach that captures diauxie as an emergent property of sub-population dynamics rather than a homogeneous metabolic shift in E. coli monocultures. Without fine tuning of the parameters of E. coli core genome-scale model we obtain good agreement with published data. Our results suggest a change of paradigm in using single organism metabolic models, which can only to a certain approximation represent the average population metabolic state.

Postmortem brain tissue studies comparing BPD patients with healthy controls have produced a heterogeneous array of potentially implicated protein-coding RNAs. We hypothesized that dysregulation of not only coding, but multiple classes of RNA (coding RNA, long non-coding (lnc) RNA, circular (circ) RNA, and/or alternative splicing) underlie the pathogenesis of BPD. Using non-polyadenylated libraries we performed RNA sequencing in postmortem human medial frontal gyrus tissue from BPD patients and healthy controls. We found twenty genes, some of which not previously implicated in BPD, differentially expressed. PCR validation and replication confirmed the implication of these DE genes. Functional analyses identified enrichment of angiogenesis, vascular system development and histone H3-K4 demethylation. In addition, ten lncRNA transcripts were differentially expressed. Furthermore, we detected an overall increased number of alternative splicing events in BPD, as well as an increase in the number of genes carrying alternative splicing events. Finally, we report altered levels of two circular transcripts, cNEBL and cEPHA3. In conclusion, our non-coding RNA findings demonstrate that RNA dysregulation in BPD is not limited to coding regions, opening avenues for future pharmacological investigations and biomarker research.","NA"

The role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations in the development of thyroid cancer is a highly controversial topic. In this study, we investigated the role of mt-DNA control region (CR) variations in thyroid tumor progression and the influence of mtDNA haplogroups on susceptibility to thyroid tumors.\n\nMaterial & methodFor this purpose, totally 108 hot thyroid nodules (HTNs), 95 cold thyroid nodules (CTNs), 48 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) samples with their surrounding tissues and 104 healthy control subjects blood samples were screened for entire mtDNA CR variations by using Sanger sequencing. The obtained DNA sequences were anaysed with the mistomaster, a web-based bioinformatics tool.\n\nResultsMtDNA haplogroup U was significantly associated with susceptibility to benign and malign thyroid entities on the other hand J haplogroup was associated with a protective role for benign thyroid nodules. Besides, 8 SNPs (T146C, G185A, C194T, C295T, G16129A, T16304C, A16343G and T16362C) in mtDNA CR region were associated with the occurrence of benign and malign thyroid nodules in Turkish population. By contrast with the healthy Turkish population and HTNs, frequency of C7 repeats in D310 polycytosine sequence was found higher in cold thyroid nodules and PTC samples. Beside this, the frequency of somatic mutations in mtMSI regions including T16189C and D514 CA dinucleotide repeats were found higher in PTC samples than the benign thyroid nodules. Conversely, the frequency of somatic mutations in D310 was detected higher in HTNs than CTNs and PTCs.\n\nConclusionmtDNA D310 instability do not play a role in tumorogenesis of the PTC but the results indicates that it might be used as a diagnostic clonal expansion biomarker for premalignant thyroid tumor cells. Beside this, D514 CA instability might be used as prognostic biomarker in PTCs. Also, we showed that somatic mutation rate is less frequent in more aggressive tumors when we examined micro- and macro carcinomas as well as BRAFV600E mutation.","10.1530/endoabs.56.p1149"

Here we examined the possible role of Lag3 in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Through quantitative real-time PCR and RNA-sequencing, we found that the expression levels of Lag3 were relatively low in the adult mouse brains, yet its expression was increased after prion infection. However, we failed finding significant differences regarding the incubation time, PrPSc load, neurodegeneration, astrocyte and microglia reactions and inflammatory gene expression between the Lag3 knockout mice and wild-type littermate controls after prion infection.

The yeast rDNA is the site of a diverse set of DNA-dependent processes, including transcription of ribosomal RNAs by RNA Polymerases I and III, transcription of non-coding RNAs by RNA Polymerase II, DNA replication initiation, replication fork blocking, and recombination-mediated regulation of rDNA repeat copy number. All of this takes place in the context of chromatin, but relatively little is known about the roles played by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors at the yeast rDNA. In this work, we report that the Isw2 and Ino80 chromatin remodeling factors are targeted to this highly repetitive locus. We characterize for the first time their function in modifying local chromatin structure, finding that loss of these factors affects the occupancy of nucleosomes in the 35S ribosomal RNA gene and the positioning of nucleosomes flanking the ribosomal origin of replication. In addition, we report that Isw2 and Ino80 promote efficient firing of the ribosomal origin of replication and facilitate the regulated increase of rDNA repeat copy number. This work significantly expands our understanding of the importance of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling for rDNA biology.\n\nAuthor SummaryTo satisfy high cellular demand for ribosomes, genomes contain many copies of the genes encoding the RNA components of ribosomes. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these ribosomal RNA genes are located in the \""ribosomal DNA locus\"", a highly repetitive array that contains approximately 150 copies of the same unit, in contrast to the single copies that suffice for most genes. This repetitive quality creates unique regulatory needs. Chromatin structure, the packaging and organization of DNA, is a critical determinant of DNA-dependent processes throughout the genome. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors are important regulators of chromatin structure, and yet relatively little is known about how members of this class of protein affect DNA organization or behavior at the rDNA. In this work, we show that the Isw2 and Ino80 chromatin remodeling factors regulate two features of chromatin structure at the rDNA, the occupancy and the positioning of nucleosomes. In addition, we find that these factors regulate two critical processes that function uniquely at this locus: DNA replication originating from within the rDNA array, and the regulated increase of rDNA repeat copy number.","NA"

Over the past few years, we have seen wide scale improvements in data processing, database, and statistical analysis tools. Direct infusion mass spectrometery (DIMS) is a widely used platform that is able to produce a global fingerprint of the metabolome, without the requirement of a prior chromatographic step - making it ideal for wide scale high-throughput metabolomics analysis. In spite of these developments, metabolite identification still remains a key bottleneck in untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics studies. The first step of the metabolite identification task is to query masses against a metaboite database to get putative metabolite annotations. Each existing metabolite database differs in a number of aspects including coverage, format, and accessibility - often limiting the user to a rudimentary web interface. Manually combining multiple search results for a single experiment where there may be potentially hundreds of masses to investigate becomes an incredibly arduous task.\n\nResultsTo facilitate unified access to metabolite information we have created the Direct Infusion MEtabolite database (DIMEdb), a comprehensive web-based metabolite database that contains over 80,000 metabolites sourced from a number of renowned metabolite databases of which can be utilised in the analysis and annotation of DIMS data.

This raises the need to explicitly model the resulting uncertainty and take it into account in any downstream analysis, such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression. Here, we introduce Single-cell Variational Inference (scVI), a scalable framework for probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells. Our model uses variational inference, stochastic optimization and deep neural networks to approximate the parameters that govern the distribution of expression values of each gene in every cell, using a non-linear mapping between the observations and a low-dimensional latent space.\n\nBy doing so, scVI pools information between similar cells or genes while taking nuisance factors of variation such as batch effects and limited sensitivity into account. To evaluate scVI, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis to existing methods for distributional modeling and dimensionality reduction, all of which rely on generalized linear models. We first show that scVI scales to over one million cells, whereas competing algorithms can process at most tens of thousands of cells. Next, we show that scVI fits unseen data more closely and can impute missing data more accurately, both indicative of a better generalization capacity. We then utilize scVI to conduct a set of fundamental analysis tasks - including batch correction, visualization, clustering and differential expression - and demonstrate its accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art tools in each task. scVI is publicly available, and can be readily used as a principled and inclusive solution for multiple tasks of single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.","10.1038/s41592-018-0229-2"

These include several human pathogens, as well as dsDNA bacteriophages - viruses that infect bacteria. We previously proposed that DNA is not a passive substrate of bacteriophage packaging motors but is, instead, an active component of the machinery. Computational studies on dsDNA in the channel of viral portal proteins reported here reveal DNA conformational changes consistent with that hypothesis. dsDNA becomes longer (\""stretched\"") in regions of high negative electrostatic potential, and shorter (\""scrunched\"") in regions of high positive potential. These results suggest a mechanism that couples the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to DNA translocation: The chemical cycle of ATP binding, hydrolysis and product release drives a cycle of protein conformational changes. This produces changes in the electrostatic potential in the channel through the portal, and these drive cyclic changes in the length of dsDNA. The DNA motions are captured by a coordinated protein-DNA grip-and-release cycle to produce DNA translocation. In short, the ATPase, portal and dsDNA work synergistically to promote genome packaging.","NA"

Environmental DNA is increasingly used as a conservation tool for early detection and monitoring of AIS. We used a novel eDNA high-resolution melt curve (HRM) approach to simultaneously detect the UK endangered native crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes), the highly invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and their dominant pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci, (causative agent of crayfish plague). We validated the approach with laboratory and field samples in areas with known presence or absence of both crayfish species as well as the pathogen, prior to the monitoring of areas where their presence was unknown. We identified the presence of infected signal crayfish further upstream than previously detected in an area where previous intensive eradication attempts had taken place, and the coexistence of both species in plague free catchments. We also detected the endangered native crayfish in an area where trapping had failed.

To investigate this question, we sequenced the genome of an isolate of Rickettsia typhi, an important and neglected cause of fever across much of the tropics and subtropics, for which only three genomic sequences previously existed. We prepared and sequenced libraries on a MinION in Vientiane, Lao PDR using v9.5 chemistry and in parallel we sequenced the same isolate on the Illumina platform in a genomics laboratory in the UK.

We present a novel computational approach (eVIVALDI - eco-eVolutionary mIcrobial indiViduAL-baseD sImulations) to study phage-bacteria ecological interactions that integrates a large number of processes, including population dynamics, environmental structure, genome evolution, and phage-mediated horizontal transfer. We validate and illustrate the relevance of the model by focusing on three specific questions: the ecological interactions between bacteria and virulent phage during phage and antibiotic therapy, the role of prophages as competitive weapons, and how autotransduction facilitates bacterial acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes upon lysis of antibiotic resistant competitors. Our model recapitulates experimental and theoretical observations and provides novel insights. In particular, we find that environmental structure has a strong effect on community dynamics and evolutionary outcomes in all three case studies. Strong environmental structure, relative to well-mixed environments and especially if antibiotics are heterogeneously distributed, enhances the rate of acquisition of resistance to both phages and antibiotics, and leads to more accurate predictions of the dynamics of lysogen invasion in the gastrointestinal tract. We predicted the co-existence of invaders and resident lysogens in autotransduction under a range of parameters, and validated this key prediction experimentally. By linking ecological and evolutionary dynamics, our modelling approach sheds light on the factors that influence the dynamics of phage-bacteria interactions. It can also be expanded to put forward novel hypotheses, facilitating the design of phage therapy treatments and the assessment of the role of phages in the spread of antibiotic resistance.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn the face of a growing threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria, bacteriophages have re-emerged as a potential alternative to clinical treatments of infections, as they are efficient bacterial predators. However, bacteriophages can also promote, through a mechanism called transduction, the dissemination of adaptive traits between bacteria, including antibiotic resistance genes. Importantly, these two types of interactions (predation and transduction) can co-occur, which creates difficulties in predicting their outcome. We have developed eVIVALDI (eco-eVolutionary mIcrobial indiViduAL-baseD sImulations), a computational model that allows the simulation of microbial communities with a focus on the mechanisms involved in phage-bacteria interactions, across time and in different types of environments. eVIVALDI can be used to understand the conditions where phages are more likely to be successfully used to eliminate bacteria or, in the other hand, the conditions where they increase the probability of dissemination of adaptive traits. Our research highlights the importance of considering the diverse ways that phage and bacteria interact, and the relevant ecological conditions where these interactions take place, to understand how bacteriophages shape microbial communities and how they can be used as a clinical tool.","NA"

Consequently, HDAC11-deficient mice exhibit dramatically enhanced thermogenic potential and, in response to high fat feeding, attenuated obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. Ex vivo and cell-based assays revealed that HDAC11 catalytic activity suppresses the BAT transcriptional program, in both the basal state and in response to {beta}-adrenergic receptor signaling, through a mechanism that is dependent on physical association with BRD2, a bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) acetyl-histone binding protein.

The etiology of this increased fracture risk is not fully known, but it is possible that fracture initiates systemic bone loss leading to greater fracture risk at all skeletal sites. In this study we investigated systemic bone loss and recovery following femoral fracture in young (3 month old) and middle-aged (12 month old) mice. Transverse femur fractures were created using a controlled impact, and whole-body bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular and cortical microstructure, bone mechanical properties, bone formation and resorption rates, mouse voluntary movement, and systemic inflammation were quantified at multiple time points post-fracture. We found that fracture led to decreased whole-body BMD in both young and middle-aged mice 2 weeks post-fracture; this bone loss was recovered by 6 weeks in young, but not middle-aged mice. Similarly, trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of the L5 vertebral body was significantly reduced in fractured mice relative to control mice 2 weeks post-fracture (-11% for young mice, -18% for middle-aged mice); this bone loss was fully recovered by 6 weeks post-fracture in young mice. At 3 days post-fracture we observed significant increases in serum levels of interleukin-6 and significant decreases in voluntary movement in fractured mice compared to control mice, with considerably greater changes in middle-aged mice than in young mice. At this time point we also observed increased osteoclast number on L5 vertebral body trabecular bone of fractured mice compared to control mice. These data show that systemic bone loss occurs after fracture in both young and middle-aged mice, and recovery from this bone loss may vary with age. This systemic response could contribute to increased future fracture risk following fracture, and these data may inform clinical treatment of fractures with respect to improving long-term skeletal health.","10.1002/jbmr.3579"

Accordingly, phenotypic correlations are often assumed to reflect genotypic correlations in evolutionary biology. Cheveruds conjecture asserts that the use of phenotypic correlations as proxies for genetic correlations is appropriate. Empirical evidence of the conjecture has been found across plant and animal species, with results suggesting that there is indeed a robust relationship between the two. Here, we investigate the conjecture in human populations, an analysis made possible by recent developments in availability of human genomic data and computing resources. A sample of 108,035 British European individuals from the UK Biobank was split equally into discovery and replication datasets. 17 traits were selected based on sample size, distribution and heritability. Genetic correlations were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression applied to the genome-wide association summary statistics of pairs of traits, and compared within and across datasets. Strong and significant correlations were found for the between-dataset comparison, suggesting that the genetic correlations from one independent sample were able to predict the phenotypic correlations from another independent sample within the same population. Designating the selected traits as morphological or non-morphological indicated little difference in correlation. The results of this study support the existence of a relationship between genetic and phenotypic correlations in humans. This finding is of specific interest in anthropological studies, which use measured phenotypic correlations to make inferences about the genetics of ancient human populations.","10.1534/genetics.117.300630"

However, developmental neuroimaging research has only recently begun to move beyond characterizing brain function exclusively in terms of magnitude of neural activation to incorporate estimates of variability. No prior neuroimaging study has done so in the domain of emotion regulation. We investigated how age and affective experiences relate to spatial and temporal variability in neural activity during emotion regulation. In the current study, 70 typically developing youth aged 8-17 years completed a cognitive reappraisal task of emotion regulation while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Estimates of spatial and temporal variability during regulation were calculated across a network of brain regions, defined a priori, and were then related to age and affective experiences. Results showed that increasing age was associated with reduced spatial and temporal variability in a set of frontoparietal regions (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobule) known to be involved in effortful emotion regulation. In addition, youth who reported less negative affect during regulation had less spatial variability in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which has previously been linked to cognitive reappraisal. We interpret age-related reductions in spatial and temporal variability as implying neural specialization. These results suggest that the development of emotion regulation is undergirded by a process of neural specialization and open up a host of possibilities for incorporating neural variability into the study of emotion regulation development.","NA"

However, many task-state FC studies do not remove the first-order effect of taskevoked activations prior to estimating task-state FC. It has been argued that this results in the ambiguous inference \""likely active or interacting during the task\"", rather than the intended inference \""likely interacting during the task\"". Utilizing a neural mass computational model, we verified that task-evoked activations substantially and inappropriately inflate task-state FC estimates, especially in functional MRI (fMRI) data. Various methods attempting to address this problem have been developed, yet the efficacies of these approaches have not been systematically assessed. We found that most standard approaches for fitting and removing mean task-evoked activations were unable to correct these inflated correlations. In contrast, methods that flexibly fit mean task-evoked response shapes effectively corrected the inflated correlations without reducing effects of interest. Results with empirical fMRI data confirmed the models predictions, revealing activation-induced task-state FC inflation for both Pearson correlation and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) approaches.

Using a new methodology (chemo-fMRI), where we combine awake resting state brain imaging with viral vector mediated chemogenetic activation (PSAM/PSEM), we could demonstrate that increased excitability of dorsal hippocampus neurons altered resting state functional connectivity within circuitry specifically related to the extent of diminution of neuropathic behavior (tactile allodynia).

While most animals possess a diploid life cycle, plants and algae alternate between multicellular haploid (gametophyte) and diploid (sporophyte) generations. In many algae, gametophytes and sporophytes are independent and free living, and may present dramatic phenotypic differences. The same shared genome can therefore be subject to different, even conflicting, selection pressures in each of the life cycle generations. Here, we have analysed the nature and extent of genome-wide generation-biased gene expression in four species of brown algae with contrasting levels of dimorphism between life cycle generations, in order to assess the potential role of generation-specific selection in shaping patterns of gene expression and divergence.\n\nResultsWe show that the proportion of the transcriptome that is generation-biased is associated with the level of phenotypic dimorphism between the life cycle stages. Importantly, our data reveals a remarkably high turnover rate for life-cycle-related gene sets across the brown algae and highlights the importance not only of co-option of regulatory programs from one generation to the other but also a key role for newly emerged, lineage-specific genes in the evolution of the gametophyte and sporophyte developmental programs in this major eukaryotic group. Moreover, we show that generation-biased genes display distinct evolutionary modes, with gametophyte-biased genes evolving rapidly at the coding sequence level whereas sporophyte-biased genes exhibit changes in their patterns of expression.\n\nConclusionOur analysis uncovers the characteristics, expression patterns and evolution of generation-biased genes and underline the selective forces that shape this previously underappreciated source of phenotypic diversity.","10.1186/s13059-019-1630-6"

Although studies show that human enteropathogenic bacteria survive both on the surface of and inside plants, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying plant invasion and colonization. Here, we examined the interaction between the human pathogenic bacterium Shigella and the model plant Arabidopsis. We found that four Shigella spp. strains proliferated successfully in Arabidopsis, causing symptom-like lesions in tissues. Using mutants lacking T3S effectors (i.e., noninvasive human strains), we demonstrated that effectors regulating pathogenesis of shigellosis in humans also play a central role in bacteria-plant interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine Shigella-mediated virulence and host immune suppression in a plant host at a molecular level.\n\nSummaryAlthough there is debate about whether human intestinal pathogenic bacteria are also plant pathogens, it is clear that these bacteria use plants as an alternative host. Shigella, which infects primates, is reportedly transmitted by fresh vegetables; however, its molecular interactions with plants have not been extensively studied. Here, we show that four Shigella strains, S. boydii (S. b), S. sonnei (S. s), S. flexneri 2a (S. f 2a), and S. flexneri 5a (S. f 5a), proliferated at different levels in Arabidopsis thaliana. Microscopic studies revealed that these bacteria were present inside leaves and damaged plant cells. GFP-labeled S. b, S. f 2a, and S. f 5a entered plants via guard cells, and S. f 2a infiltrated root tissues and colonized roots. Using mutants lacking type III secretion systems (T3SS), we found that T3SS of Shigella that regulate the pathogenesis of shigellosis in humans also play a central role in attachment and multiplication in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive activity of two T3S effectors, OspF and OspG, were needed for the proliferation of Shigella in Arabidopsis. These findings demonstrate that Shigella-mediated virulence determinants are expressed, and pathogenic symptoms are observed, in model plants.","10.1111/pce.13603"

Participants with chronic stroke (n = 11), and age-matched controls (n = 11) performed unimanual and bimanual reaching movements to move a cursor on a screen to different targets.

However, mass collection of such sensitive data entails enormous risks if not protected to the highest standards. In this article, we follow the position and argue that post-alignment privacy is not enough and that data should be automatically protected as early as possible in the genomics workflow, ideally immediately after the data is produced. We show that a previous approach for filtering short reads cannot extend to long reads and present a novel filtering approach that classifies raw genomic data (i.e., whose location and content is not yet determined) into privacy-sensitive (i.e., more affected by a successful privacy attack) and non-privacy-sensitive information. Such a classification allows the fine-grained and automated adjustment of protective measures to mitigate the possible consequences of exposure, in particular when relying on public clouds. We present the first filter that can be indistinctly applied to reads of any length, i.e., making it usable with any recent or future sequencing technologies. The filter is accurate, in the sense that it detects all known sensitive nucleotides except those located in highly variable regions (less than 10 nucleotides remain undetected per genome instead of 100,000 in previous works). It has far less false positives than previously known methods (10% instead of 60%) and can detect sensitive nucleotides despite sequencing errors (86% detected instead of 56% with 2% of mutations).

On the privacy side, since genomic data are utterly sensitive, several cryptographic mechanisms have been proposed to align reads securely, with a lower performance than the former, which in turn are not secure. This manuscript proposes a novel contribution to improving the privacy performance product in current genomic studies. Building on recent works that argue that genomics data needs to be x treated according to a threat-risk analysis, we introduce a multi-level sensitivity classification of genomic variations. Our classification prevents the amplification of possible privacy attacks, thanks to promoting and partitioning mechanisms among sensitivity levels. Thanks to this classification, reads can be aligned, stored, and later accessed, using different security levels. We then extend a recent filter, which detects the reads that carry sensitive information, to classify reads into sensitivity levels. Finally, based on a review of the existing alignment methods, we show that adapting alignment algorithms to reads sensitivity allows high performance gains, whilst enforcing high privacy levels. Our results indicate that using sensitivity levels is feasible to optimize the performance of privacy preserving alignment, if one combines the advantages of private and public clouds.","NA"

We adapt a deep learning approach, deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs), for modeling immune cell gene expression patterns in lung adenocarcinoma. Specifically, a partially partitioned training approach for dealing with a relatively large number of genes. We also propose a sampling-based approach that smooths the original data according to a trained DBM and can be used for visualization and clustering. The identified clusters can subsequently be judged with respect to association with clinical characteristics, such as tumor stage, providing an external criterion for selecting DBM network architecture and tuning parameters for training. We show that the hidden nodes of the trained networks cannot only be linked to clinical characteristics but also to specific genes, which are the visible nodes of the network. We find that hidden nodes that are linked to tumor stage and survival represent expression of T-cell and mast cell genes among others, probably reflecting specific immune cell infiltration patterns. Thus, DBMs, trained and selected by the proposed approach, might provide a useful tool for extracting immune cell gene expression patterns. In the case of lung adenocarcinomas, these patterns are linked to survival as well as other patient characteristics, which could be useful for uncovering the underlying biology.","NA"

We demonstrated that this species contains one of the highest yields of pure PlTX production ever found, 2.22 {+/-} 0.41 mg PlTX per gram of wet Palythoa. Using molecular data combined with external morphology, we identified Palythoa sp. Pc001 as the sister species to Palythoa aff. clavata. Further, the clade of a symbiotic Symbiodinium sp. was characterised by DNA barcoding and pigment content. Molecular data showed that Palythoa sp. Pc001 contains  generalist Symbiodinium belonging to clade C. This paper also describes for the first time the localisation of PlTX and Symbiodinium cells in tissues of a highly toxic Palythoa species. PlTX toxicity was assayed on 72 h-cultured murine and human cancer cells versus the normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF; PC C12300) cell line. Using MTT colorimetric assay and quantitative videomicroscopy, our results showed much higher in vitro cytotoxic activity on cancer cells (IC50 0.54 {+/-} 0.05 x 10-12 M) than on non-cancerous ones (IC50 > 1 x 10-6 M). Such a strong differential effect has never been reported with respect to the most potent NaK ligands (cardiac glycosides) described so far. Moreover, PlTX displayed similar in vitro growth inhibitory activity in rodent and human cancer cells, although the NaK in rodents displays a double mutation in the 1-subunit that usually decreases the sensitivity to others cardiac glycosides like ouabain, when compared to human cells. This work demonstrates, first, that picomolar concentrations of PlTX have significant higher cytotoxic effects on cancer cells than on non-cancerous ones, and secondly, that this in vitro antitumor effect would not be entirely relied onto its canonical targeting to the NaK -subunit.

Here, we test the influence of these factors on the dispersal history of the flowering plant genus Erica (Ericaceae) across the Afrotemperate. We quantify similarity of Erica climate niches per biogeographic area using direct observations of species, and test various colonisation scenarios while estimating ancestral areas for the Erica clade using parametric biogeographic model testing. We infer that the overall dispersal history of Erica across the Afrotemperate is the result of infrequent colonisation limited by geographic proximity and niche similarity. However, the Drakensberg Mountains represent a colonisation sink, rather than acting as a \""stepping stone\"" between more distant and ecologically dissimilar Cape and Tropical African regions. Strikingly, the most dramatic examples of species radiations in Erica were the result of single unique dispersals over longer distances between ecologically dissimilar areas, contradicting the rule of phylogenetic biome conservatism. These results highlight the importance of rare biome shifts, in which a unique dispersal event fuels evolutionary radiation.\n\nThis article has been peer-reviewed and recommended by: Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology (DOI: 10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100065)","10.1186/s12862-019-1545-6"

However, recent experimental results have produced examples of populations that have multiple fitness peaks, or that experience frequency-dependence that affects the direction and strength of selection on certain individuals. Here, we extend classical fitness gradient formulations of natural selection in order to describe the dynamics of a phenotype distribution in terms of its moments--such as the mean, variance, skewness, etc. The number of governing equations in our model can be adjusted in order to capture different degrees of detail about the population. We compare our simplified model to direct Wright-Fisher simulations of evolution in several canonical fitness landscapes, we find that our model provides a low-dimensional description of complex dynamics not typically explained by classical theory, such as cryptic selection forces due to selection on trait ranges, time-variation of the heritability, and nonlinear responses to stabilizing or disruptive selection due to asymmetric trait distributions. In addition to providing a framework for extending general understanding of common qualitative concepts in phenotypic evolution--such as fitness gradients, selection pressures, and heritability--our approach has practical importance for studying evolution in contexts in which genetic analysis is infeasible.","10.1016/j.tpb.2018.11.002"

Karst.) is a conifer species of substanital economic and ecological importance. In common with most conifers, the P. abies genome is very large ([~]20 Gbp) and contains a high fraction of repetitive DNA. The current P. abies genome assembly (v1.0) covers approximately 60% of the total genome size but is highly fragmented, consisting of >10 million scaffolds. The genome annotation contains 66,632 gene models that are at least partially validated (www.congenie.org), however, the fragmented nature of the assembly means that there is currently little information available on how these genes are physically distributed over the 12 P. abies chromosomes. By creating an ultra-dense genetic linkage map, we anchored and ordered scaffolds into linkage groups, which complements the fine-scale information available in assembly contigs. Our ultra-dense haploid consensus genetic map consists of 21,056 markers derived from 14,336 scaffolds that contain 17,079 gene models (25.6% of the validated gene models) that we have anchored to the 12 linkage groups. We used data from three independent component maps, as well as comparisons with previously published Picea maps to evaluate the accuracy and marker ordering of the linkage groups. We demonstrate that approximately 3.8% of the anchored scaffolds and 1.6% of the gene models covered by the consensus map have likely assembly errors as they contain genetic markers that map to different regions within or between linkage groups. We further evaluate the utility of the genetic map for the conifer research community by using an independent data set of unrelated individuals to assess genome-wide variation in genetic diversity using the genomic regions anchored to linkage groups. The results show that our map is sufficiently dense to enable detailed evolutionary analyses across the P. abies genome.","10.1534/g3.118.200840"

We tackle this problem by observing the activity of a large population of neurons in the CNS of larval Drosophila. We focused on two major behaviors of the larvae, forward and backward locomotion, and analyzed the neuronal activity related to these behaviors during fictive locomotion that spontaneously occurs in the isolated CNS. We expressed genetically-encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP, and a nuclear marker in all neurons and used digital scanned light-sheet microscopy to record neural activities in the entire ventral nerve cord at a fast frame rate. We developed image processing tools that automatically detect the cell position based on the nuclear staining and allocate the activity signals to each detected cell. We also applied a machine learning-based method that we developed recently to assign motor status in each time frame. Based on these methods, we find cells whose activity is biased to forward versus backward locomotion and vice versa. In particular, we identified a group of neurons near the boundary of subesophageal zone (SEZ) and thoracic neuromeres, which are strongly active during an early phase of backward but not forward fictive locomotion.

Motor adaptation, which occurs when participants learn to reach accurately to a target despite a perturbation, does not deviate from this rule. There are currently three major hypotheses that have been put forward to explain this age-related decline in adaptation: deterioration of internal model recalibration due to age-related cerebellar degeneration, impairment of the cognitive component of motor adaptation, and deficit in the retention of the learned movement. In the present study, we systematically investigated these three hypotheses in a large sample of older women and men. We demonstrate that age-related deficits in motor adaptation are not due to impaired internal model recalibration or impaired retention of motor memory. Rather, we found that the cognitive component was reduced in older people. Therefore, our study suggests the interesting possibility that cerebellar-based mechanisms do not deteriorate with age despite cerebellar degeneration.

The i.i.d. assumption can be an over-simplification for many problems in computational biology and bioinformatics. In particular, sequential dependence within biomolecular sequences is often an essential biological feature due to biochemical function, evolutionary processes such as recombination, and other factors.\n\nTo relax the simplifying i.i.d. assumption, we propose a new non-parametric/semi-parametric sequential resampling technique that generalizes \""Heads-or-Tails\"" mirrored inputs, a simple but clever technique due to Landan and Graur. The generalized procedure takes the form of random walks along either aligned or unaligned biomolecular sequences.

In mouse liver, harmonics of the 24-hour period of gene transcription hallmarked genes oscillating with a frequency two or three times faster than the circadian circuitry. Many of these harmonic transcripts enriched pathways regulating responses to environmental stress and coinciding preferentially with subjective dawn and dusk. We hypothesized that these stress anticipatory genes would be more evolutionarily conserved than background circadian and non-circadian genes. To investigate this issue, we performed broad computational analyses of genes/proteins oscillating at different frequency ranges across several species and showed that ultradian genes/proteins, especially those oscillating with a 12-hour periodicity, are more likely to be of ancient origin and essential in mice.

The nature and origin of their genetic and taxonomic differentiation remains controversial due the lack of known reproductive barriers and morphologic similarity. In particular, whether ecological and/or intrinsic isolating mechanisms participate to species divergence remains unknown. The recent co-introduction of both taxa into Europe offers a unique opportunity to test how genetic differentiation maintains under new environmental and demographic conditions. We generated a pseudo-chromosome assembly of the Pacific oyster genome using a combination of BAC-end sequencing and scaffold anchoring to a new high-density linkage map. We characterized genome-wide differentiation between C. angulata and C. gigas in both their native and introduced ranges, and showed that gene flow between species has been facilitated by their recent co-introductions in Europe. Nevertheless, patterns of genomic divergence between species remain highly similar in Asia and Europe, suggesting that the environmental transition caused by the co-introduction of the two species did not affect the genomic architecture of their partial reproductive isolation. Increased genetic differentiation was preferentially found in regions of low recombination. Using historical demographic inference, we show that the heterogeneity of differentiation across the genome is well explained by a scenario whereby recent gene flow has eroded past differentiation at different rates across the genome after a period of geographical isolation. Our results thus support the view that low-recombining regions help in maintaining intrinsic genetic differences between the two species.","10.1093/gbe/evy194"

We isolated two mutations affecting the MAP kinase scaffold protein KSR-1 and found that KSR-1 modulates locomotion downstream of or in parallel to the Gq-Rho pathway. Through epistasis experiments, we found that the core ERK MAPK cascade is required for Gq-Rho regulation of locomotion, but that the canonical ERK activator LET-60/Ras may not be required. Through neuron-specific rescue experiments, we found that the ERK pathway functions in head acetylcholine neurons to control Gq-dependent locomotion. Additionally, expression of activated LIN-45/Raf in head acetylcholine neurons is sufficient to cause an exaggerated waveform phenotype and hypersensitivity to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb, similar to an activated Gq mutant.

In spite of these developments, metabolite identification still remains a key bottleneck in untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics studies.

Optogenetic activation of Seta and Leta neurons increased backward locomotion. Conversely, thermogenetic inhibition of 5-HT2A-GAL4 neurons or application of a 5-HT2 antagonist decreased backward locomotion induced by noxious light stimuli.

Initial computational approaches to transfer knowledge across species have relied on measures of heredity such as genetic homology, but these approaches suffer from limitations. First, only a small subset of genes have homologs, limiting the amount of knowledge that can be transferred, and second, genes change or repurpose functions, complicating the transfer of knowledge. Many approaches address this problem by expanding the notion of homology by leveraging high-throughput genomic and proteomic measurements, such as through network alignment.\n\nIn this work, we take a new approach to transferring knowledge across species by expanding the notion of homology through explicit measures of functional similarity between proteins in different species.

We show that inner products in this space capture functional similarity across species, and the vectors themselves are useful for a variety of cross species tasks. We perform the first whole-genome method for predicting phenologs, generating many that were previously identified, but also predicting new phenologs supported from the biological literature. We also demonstrate the HO_SCPLOWANDLC_SCPLOW-embedding captures pairwise gene function, in that gene pairs with synthetic lethal interactions are co-located in HO_SCPLOWANDLC_SCPLOW-space both within and across species.

M.; Fuqua, C.","Clay Fuqua","Indiana University Bloomington","2018-03-30",2,"4","new results","microbiology","A core regulatory pathway that directs developmental transitions and cellular asymmetries in Agrobacterium tumefaciens involves two overlapping, integrated phosphorelays. One of these phosphorelays putatively includes four histidine sensor kinase homologues, DivJ, PleC, PdhS1, and PdhS2, and two response regulators, DivK and PleD. In several different alphaproteobacteria, this pathway influences a conserved downstream phosphorelay that ultimately controls the phosphorylation state of the CtrA master response regulator. The PdhS2 sensor kinase reciprocally regulates biofilm formation and swimming motility. In the current study the mechanisms by which the A. tumefaciens sensor kinase PdhS2 directs this regulation are delineated. PdhS2 lacking a key residue for phosphatase activity is markedly deficient in proper control of attachment and motility phenotypes, whereas a kinase-deficient PdhS2 mutant is only modestly affected. A genetic interaction between DivK and PdhS2 is revealed, unmasking one of several connections between PdhS2-dependent phenotypes and transcriptional control by CtrA. Epistasis experiments suggest that PdhS2 can function independently of the CckA sensor kinase, the cognate sensor kinase for CtrA which is inhibited by DivK. PdhS2 dynamically localizes to the daughter cell pole in dividing cells. Global expression analysis of the pdhS2 mutant reveals a restricted regulon, functioning through CtrA to separately control motility and regulate levels of the intracellular signal cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (cdGMP), thereby affecting production of adhesive polysaccharides and attachment. We hypothesize that in A. tumefaciens the CtrA regulatory circuit has expanded to include additional inputs through addition of PdhS-type sensor kinases, likely fine-tuning the response of this organism to the soil microenvironment.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacterial developmental processes, such as morphological transformations and behavioral transitions, are tightly regulated. In many alphaproteobacteria cell division and development are coordinated by a specific suite of conserved histidine kinases and their partnered regulatory proteins. Here we describe how the histidine kinase PdhS2 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens regulates complex phenotypes including biofilm formation and motility. PdhS2 genetically interacts with a single-domain response regulator, DivK, and the intracellular signal cyclic diguanylate monophosphate. PdhS2 dynamically localizes to the new pole of recently divided cells, contributing to the regulatory processes that dictate whether these cells remain motile or initiate biofilm formation. These findings expand our understanding of the complex network that integrates cell division and developmental control in A. tumefaciens and related alphaproteobacteria.","10.1099/mic.0.000758"

We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.\n\nAuthor SummaryResting state fMRI has become a ubiquitous tool for measuring connectivity in normal and diseased brains. Current dominant models of connectivity are based on coarse-scale connectivity among brain regions, ignoring fine-scale structure within those regions. We developed a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome that captures both coarse and fine-scale structure of connectivity shared across brains. We showed that this shared fine-scale structure is related to fine-scale distinctions in representation of information, and our model accounts for substantially more shared variance of connectivity compared to previous models.

Understanding the scope of off-target mutations in Cas9 or Cpf1-edited crops is critical for research and regulation. In plants, only limited studies had used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to test off-target effects of Cas9. However, the cause of numerous discovered mutations is still controversial. Furthermore, WGS based off-target analysis of Cpf1 has not been reported in any higher organism to date. Here, we conducted a WGS analysis of 34 plants edited by Cas9 and 15 plants edited by Cpf1 in T0 and T1 generations along with 20 diverse control plants in rice, a major food crop with a genome size of ~380 Mb. The sequencing depth ranged from 45X to 105X with reads mapping rate above 96%. Our results clearly show that most mutations in edited plants were created by tissue culture process, which caused ~102 to 148 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and ~32 to 83 insertions/deletions (indels) per plant. Among 12 Cas9 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and 3 Cpf1 CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) assessed by WGS, only one Cas9 sgRNA resulted in off-target mutations in T0 lines at sites predicted by computer programs. Moreover, we cannot find evidence for bona fide off-target mutations due to continued expression of Cas9 or Cpf1 with guide RNAs in T1 generation. Taken together, our comprehensive and rigorous analysis of WGS big data across multiple sample types suggests both Cas9 and Cpf1 nucleases are very specific in generating targeted DNA modifications and off-targeting can be avoided by designing guide RNAs with high specificity.","10.1186/s13059-018-1458-5"

These are postulated to be single-stranded in order to be functional, yet knowledge of secondary structural features that regulate the exposure of exonic splicing motifs across the transcriptome is not currently available. Using transcriptome-wide RNA structural information we show that retained introns in mouse are commonly flanked by a short ([lsim]70 nucleotide), highly base-paired segment upstream and a predominantly single-stranded exonic segment downstream. Splicing assays with select pre-mRNA substrates demonstrate that loops immediately upstream of the introns contain pre-mRNA-specific splicing enhancers, the substitution or hybridization of which impedes splicing. Additionally, the exonic segments flanking the retained introns appeared to be more enriched in a previously identified set of hexameric exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) sequences compared to their spliced counterparts, suggesting that base-pairing in the exonic segments upstream of retained introns could be a means for occlusion of ESEs. The upstream exonic loops of the test substrate promoted recruitment of splicing factors and consequent pre-mRNA structural remodeling, leading up to assembly of the early spliceosome. These results suggest that disruption of exonic stem-loop structures immediately upstream (but not downstream) of the introns regulate alternative splicing events, likely through modulating accessibility of splicing factors.","NA"

During the Maternal-to-Zygotic Transition (MZT), thousands of maternal transcripts are regulated upon fertilization and genome activation. Transcript stability can be influenced by cis-elements and trans-factors, but how these inputs are integrated to determine the overall mRNA stability is unclear. Here, we show that most transcripts are under combinatorial regulation by multiple decay pathways during zebrafish MZT. To identify cis-regulatory elements, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay for stability-influencing sequences, which revealed that 3-UTR poly-U motifs are associated with mRNA stability. In contrast, miR-430 target sequences, UAUUUAUU AU-rich elements (ARE), CCUC and CUGC elements emerged as the main destabilizing motifs in the embryo, with miR-430 and AREs causing mRNA deadenylation in a genome activation-dependent manner. To identify the trans-factors interacting with these cis-elements, we comprehensively profiled RNA-protein interactions and their associated regulatory activities across the transcriptome during the MZT. We find that poly-U binding proteins are preferentially associated with 3-UTR sequences and stabilizing motifs, and that antagonistic sequence contexts for poly-C and poly-U binding proteins shape the binding landscape and magnitude of regulation across the transcriptome. Finally, we integrate these regulatory motifs into a machine learning model that accurately predicts the stability of mRNA reporters in vivo. Our findings reveal how mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation are coordinated to direct changes in mRNA stability within the early zebrafish embryo.","NA"

This variability may be due in part to uncertainty in the selection of the stimulation site - a challenge complicated further by the variable organization of individual human brains. In principle, precise targeting of individual-specific brain areas serving outsized roles in cognition could improve the efficacy of NIBS. Network theory predicts that the importance of a node in network can be inferred from its connections; as such, we hypothesized that targeting individual-specific \""hub\"" brain areas with NIBS would impact cognition more than non-hub brain areas. We first demonstrate that the spatial positioning of hubs is variable across individuals, but highly-reproducible when mapped with sufficient per-individual rsfMRI data. We then tested our hypothesis in healthy individuals using a prospective, within-subject, double-blind design. We found that inhibiting a hub with NIBS disrupted information processing during working-memory to a greater extent than inhibiting a non-hub area of the same gyrus. Furthermore, inhibition of hubs linking specific control networks and sensorimotor systems was retrospectively found to be most impactful. Based on these findings, we propose that precise mapping of individual-specific brain network features could inform future interventions in patients.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe network organization of every persons brain is different, but non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) interventions do not take this variation into account.

We found that administering NIBS to these individual-specific hub brain areas impacted cognition more than stimulation of non-hub areas.

Understanding of TMD dynamics is needed to better probe and target Env with small molecule and antibody therapies. However, little is known about TMD dynamics due to difficulties in describing native membrane properties. Here, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of a trimeric, prefusion TMD in a model, asymmetric viral membrane that mimics the native viral envelope. We found that water and chloride ions permeated the membrane and interacted with the highly conserved arginine bundle, (R696)3, at the center of the membrane and influenced TMD stability by creating a network of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. We propose that this (R696)3 - water - anion network plays an important role in viral fusion with the host cell by modulating protein conformational changes within the membrane. Additionally, R683 and R707 at the exofacial and cytofacial membrane-water interfaces, respectively, are anchored in the lipid headgroup region and serve as a junction point for stabilization of the termini. The membrane thins as a result of the tilting of the TMD trimer, with nearby lipids increasing in volume, leading to an entropic driving force for TMD conformational change. These results provide additional detail and perspective on the influence of certain lipid types on TMD dynamics and rationale for targeting key residues of the TMD for therapeutic design.

Hence, the interactions between EGF and breast cancer cells have long been a subject of interest for oncologists and clinicians.

In this work, we develop a theoretical model based on signal-to-noise ratio to represent stochastic properties and report our microfluidic experiments to verify the analytical predictions from the model. The results demonstrate that even under the same EGF concentration gradients, breast cancer cells can reveal distinct chemotaxis patterns at different absolute concentrations.

However, the remodeling effects of ADS-J1 on mature seminal fibrils were unexplored. Herein, we investigated the capacity of ADS-J1 to disassemble seminal fibrils and the potential mode of action by applying several biophysical and biochemical measurements, combined with molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. We found that ADS-J1 effectively remodeled SEVI, SEM186-107 fibrils and endogenous seminal fibrils. Unlike epi-gallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a universal amyloid fibril breaker, ADS-J1 disaggregated SEVI fibrils into monomeric peptides, which was independent of oxidation reaction. MD simulations revealed that ADS-J1 displayed strong binding potency to the full-length PAP248-286 via electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. ADS-J1 might initially bind to the fibrillar surface and then occupy the amyloid core, which eventually lead to fibril disassembly. Furthermore, the binding of ADS-J1 with PAP248-286 might induce conformational changes of PAP248-286. Disassembled PAP248-286 might not be favor to re-aggregate into fibrils. ADS-J1 also exerts abilities to remodel a panel of amyloid fibrils, including A{beta}1-42, hIAPP1-37 and EP2 fibrils. ADS-J1 displays promising potential to be a combination microbicide and an effective lead-product to treat amyloidogenic diseases.","10.1042/BCJ20180886"

Primary cilia are cellular organelles, present on most vertebrate cells, hypothesized to function as a fluid flow sensor. The mechanical properties of a cilium remain incompletely characterized. We measured the fluctuating position of an optically trapped cilium tip under untreated, Taxol-treated, and HIF-stabilized conditions. We applied analytical modeling to derive the mean-squared displacement of the trapped tip of a cilium and compared the results with experimental measurements. We provide, for the first time, evidence that the effective flexural rigidity of a ciliary axoneme is length-dependent, and longer cilia are stiffer than shorter cilia. We then provide a rational explanation for both effects. We demonstrate that the apparent length-dependent flexural rigidity can be understood by a combination of modeling axonemal microtubules orthotropic elastic shells and including (actin-driven) active stochastic basal body motion. It is hoped that our improved characterization of cilia will result in deeper understanding of the biological function of cellular flow sensing by this organelle. Our model could be profitably applied to motile cilia and our results also demonstrate the possibility of using easily observable ciliary dynamics to probe interior cytoskeletal dynamics.","NA"

Current experimental and computational techniques have limited ability to explore this relationship in atomistic detail over physiological timescales. A framework associating iCh structure to function is necessary for elucidating normal and disease mechanisms. We formulated a modeling schema that overcomes the limitations of current methods through applications of Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning (ML). Using this approach, we studied molecular processes that underlie human IKs voltage mediated gating. IKs malfunction underlies many debilitating and life-threatening diseases. Molecular components of IKs that underlie its electrophysiological function include KCNQ1 (pore forming tetramer) and KCNE1 (auxiliary subunit). Simulations, using the IKs structure-function model, reproduced experimentally recorded saturation of gating charge displacement at positive membrane voltages, two-step voltage sensor (VS) movement shown by fluorescence, iCh gating statistics, and current-voltage (I-V) relationship. New mechanistic insights include - (1) pore energy profile determines iCh subconductance (SC), (2) entire protein structure, not limited to the pore, contributes to pore energy and channel SC, (3) interactions with KCNE1 result in two distinct VS movements, causing gating charge saturation at positive membrane voltages and current activation delay, and (4) flexible coupling between VS and pore permits pore opening at lower VS positions, resulting in sequential gating. The new modeling approach is applicable to atomistic scale studies of other proteins on timescales of physiological function.","10.1016/j.bpj.2018.04.023"

Here we derive theoretical predictions for the expected pairwise beta diversity values under a species-level neutral scenario where all species have equal colonization and extinction rates. We test these predictions for the avian community composition of 42 islands (and 93 species) in the Thousand Island Lake, China.

To test this prediction, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) data across two sessions. In the first session, participants practiced selectively retrieving exemplars from superordinate semantic categories (high competition), as well as retrieving the names of the superordinate categories from exemplars (low competition). In the second session, participants repeatedly studied and were tested on Swahili-English vocabulary. One week after session two, participants were again tested on the vocabulary. We trained a within-subject classifier on the data from session one to distinguish high and low competition states.We then used this classifier to measure competition across multiple retrieval practice attempts in the second session. The degree to which competition decreased for a given vocabulary word predicted whether that item was subsequently remembered in the third session.

Control of these non-coding RNA can dynamically create oscillations or stability, and we show how this behaviour predisposes to oscillations in the stochastic limit. These results, supported by emerging evidence for the role of miRNA sponges in development, point towards key roles of different species of miRNA sponges, such as circular RNA, potentially in the maintenance of yet unexplained oscillatory behaviour.

To answer these questions, we set out to build extensive, bio-realistic models of brain circuitry employing systematic datasets on brain structure and function. Here we report the first modeling results of this project, focusing on the layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (V1) of the mouse. Our simulations reproduced a variety of experimental observations in a large battery of visual stimuli. The results elucidated circuit mechanisms determining patters of neuronal activity in layer 4 - in particular, the roles of feedforward thalamic inputs and specific patterns of intracortical connectivity in producing tuning of neuronal responses to the orientation of motion. Simplification of neuronal models led to specific deficiencies in reproducing experimental data, giving insights into how biological details contribute to various aspects of brain activity. To enable future development of more sophisticated models, we make the software code, the model, and simulation results publicly available.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006535"

We used an extracellular bipolar electrode to generate an electric field that will initiate an action potential at one end of the fiber or the other. Using enzymatically dissociated flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers, we demonstrate the strength and applicability of this technique. Using high-speed line scans, we estimate the conduction velocity to be approximately 0.4 m/s. In addition to measuring the conduction velocity, we can also measure the passive electrotonic potentials elicited by pulses by either applying tetrodotoxin (TTX) or reducing the bath sodium levels. We applied these methodologies to FDB fibers under elevated extracellular potassium conditions, and found that the conduction velocity is significantly reduced compared to our control concentration. Lastly, we have constructed a circuit model of a skeletal muscle in order to predict passive polarization of the fiber by the field stimuli. Our predictions from the model fiber closely resemble the recordings acquired from in vitro assays.

Almost all morphology-based phylogenies group angiosperms with Gnetales and certain extinct seed plant lineages, while most molecular phylogenies link Gnetales with conifers. In this study, we investigate the phylogenetic signal present in published seed plant morphological datasets. We use parsimony, Bayesian inference, and maximum likelihood approaches, combined with a number of experiments with the data, to address the morphological-molecular conflict. First, we ask whether the lack of association of Gnetales with conifers in morphological analyses is due to an absence of signal or to the presence of competing signals, and second, we compare the performance of parsimony and model based approaches with morphological datasets. Our results imply that the grouping of Gnetales and angiosperms is largely the result of long branch attraction, consistent across a range of methodological approaches. Thus, there is a signal for the grouping of Gnetales with conifers in morphological matrices, but it was swamped by convergence between angiosperms and Gnetales, both situated on long branches. However, this effect becomes weaker in more recent analyses, as a result of addition and critical reassessment of characters. Even when a clade including angiosperms and Gnetales is still weakly supported by parsimony, model-based approaches favor a clade of Gnetales and conifers, presumably because they are more resistant to long branch attraction. Inclusion of fossil taxa weakens rather than strengthens support for a relationship of angiosperms and Gnetales. Our analyses finally reconcile morphology with molecules in favoring a relationship of Gnetales to conifers, and show that morphology may therefore be useful in reconstructing other aspects of the phylogenetic history of the seed plants.","10.1017/pab.2018.23"

Central to this debate is whether wings evolved from an epipod (outgrowth, e.g., a gill) on ancestral crustacean leg segments, or represent a novel outgrowth from the dorsal body wall that co-opted some of the genes used to pattern the epipods. To determine whether wings can be traced to ancestral, pre-insect structures, or arose by co-option, comparisons are necessary between insects and arthropods more representative of the ancestral state, where the hypothesized proximal leg region is not fused to the body wall. To do so, we examined the function of five leg patterning genes in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and compared this to previous functional data from insects. By comparing gene knockout phenotypes of leg patterning genes in a crustacean with those of insects, we show that two ancestral crustacean leg segments were incorporated into the insect body, moving the legs epipod dorsally, up onto the back to form insect wings. Thus, our data shows that much of the body wall of insects, including the entire wing, is derived from these two ancestral proximal leg segments. This model explains all observations in favor of either the body wall origin or proximal leg origin of insect wings. Thus, our results show that insect wings are not novel structures, but instead evolved from existing, ancestral structures.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryCRISPR-Cas9 knockout of leg gap genes in a crustacean reveals that insect wings are not novel structures, they evolved from crustacean leg segments","NA"

We do not treat the effects of genetic variation as a random variable and thus are able to obtain results about the unbiasedness of this method. We demonstrate that LD Score regression can produce estimates of confounding at null SNPs that are unbiased or conservative under fairly general conditions. This robustness holds in the case of the parent genotype affecting the offspring phenotype through some environmental mechanism, despite the resulting correlation over SNPs between LD Scores and the degree of confounding.

Here, we introduce a variant of this near-equilibrium estimator capable of measuring the error in the configuration-space marginal density, validating it against a complex but exact nested Monte Carlo estimator to show that it reproduces the KL divergence with high fidelity. To illustrate its utility, we employ this new near-equilibrium estimator to assess a claim that a recently proposed Langevin integrator introduces extremely small configuration-space density errors up to the stability limit at no extra computational expense. Finally, we show how this approach to quantifying sampling bias can be applied to a wide variety of stochastic integrators by following a straightforward procedure to compute the appropriate shadow work, and describe how it can be extended to quantify the error in arbitrary marginal or conditional distributions of interest.","10.3390/e20050318"

Here we have fully integrated public ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data (n ~ 70,000), including those for 743 human transcription factors (TFs) with 97 million binding sites, and have devised a data- mining platform --designated ChIP-Atlas--to identify significant TF-genome, TF-gene, and TF-TF interactions. Using this platform, we found that TFs enriched at macrophage or T-cell enhancers also accumulated around risk loci for autoimmune diseases, whereas those enriched at hepatocyte or macrophage enhancers were preferentially detected at loci associated with HDL-cholesterol levels. Of note, we identified \""hotspots\"" around such risk loci that accumulated multiple TFs and are therefore candidates for causal variants. Integrative analysis of public chromatin-profiling data is thus able to identify TFs and tissues associated with heritable disorders.","NA"

Understanding the current evolution of coat patterns requires reliably measuring traits, quantifying heritability of the traits, and identifying the fitness consequences of specific phenotypes. Giraffe coat markings are highly variable and it has been hypothesized that variation in coat patterns most likely affects fitness by camouflaging neonates against predators. We quantified spot pattern traits of wild Masai giraffes using image analysis software, determined whether spot pattern traits were heritable, and assessed whether variation in heritable spot pattern traits was related to fitness as measured by juvenile survival. The methods we described comprise a framework for objective quantification of mammalian coat pattern traits based on photographic coat pattern data. We demonstrated that characteristics of giraffe coat spot shape are heritable. We did not find evidence for juvenile survival consequences of variation in spot traits, suggesting that spot traits are currently not under strong directional, disruptive, or stabilizing selection for neonate camouflage in our study population, but our sample size could not detect small differences in survival. Spot trait variation also may be more relevant to other components of fitness, such as adult survival or fecundity. We hope this case study will inspire further investigations of coat pattern traits.","10.7717/peerj.5690"

Their phylogeny, however, remains poorly understood and to date, only the 18S rRNA nuclear gene and mitogenomes have been used to delineate the major groups of tunicates. To resolve their evolutionary relationships and provide a first estimate of their divergence times, we used a transcriptomic approach to build a phylogenomic dataset including all major tunicate lineages, consisting of 258 evolutionarily conserved orthologous genes from representative species.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses using site-heterogeneous CAT mixture models of amino acid sequence evolution resulted in a strongly supported tree topology resolving the relationships among four major tunicate clades: 1) Appendicularia, 2) Thaliacea + Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia, 3) Molgulidae, and 4) Styelidae + Pyuridae. Notably, the morphologically derived Thaliacea are confirmed as the sister-group of the clade uniting Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia within which the precise position of the model ascidian genus Ciona remains uncertain. Relaxed molecular clock analyses accommodating the accelerated evolutionary rate of tunicates reveal ancient diversification (~450-350 million years ago) among the major groups and allow comparing their evolutionary age with respect to the major vertebrate model lineages.\n\nConclusionsOur study represents the most comprehensive phylogenomic dataset for the main tunicate lineages.

We used domain structure information from the CATH classification to perform a systematic structural analysis of the effects of MXE splicing in high quality animal genomes (e.g. human, fly, mouse and 2 fishes) and we were able to annotate approximately 50% of MXE events with structural information. For those MXE events which can be mapped to a structure, we found that although embedded in domains, they were strongly enriched in surface exposed residues.

We define an endogenous small RNA pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans that promotes heterochromatin formation at telomeres via Dicer, the perinuclear Argonaute protein WAGO-1 and the nuclear Argonaute protein HRDE-1. Loss of telomerase induces biogenesis of siRNAs that target the telomeric lncRNA TERRA, whereas loss of both telomerase and small RNA-mediated telomeric silencing induces TERRA expression, DNA damage, and an accelerated sterility phenotype. These phenotypes can be rescued by exogenous telomeric siRNAs or by loss of the DNA damage response protein EXO-1. Thus, endogenous siRNAs interact with TERRA to promote heterochromatin formation in a manner that is critical for the stability of naturally eroding telomeres.

To address this gap, we generated genome-wide data from 362 ancient individuals, including the first from eastern Iran, Turan (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan), Bronze Age Kazakhstan, and South Asia. Our data reveal a complex set of genetic sources that ultimately combined to form the ancestry of South Asians today. We document a southward spread of genetic ancestry from the Eurasian Steppe, correlating with the archaeologically known expansion of pastoralist sites from the Steppe to Turan in the Middle Bronze Age (2300-1500 BCE). These Steppe communities mixed genetically with peoples of the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) whom they encountered in Turan (primarily descendants of earlier agriculturalists of Iran), but there is no evidence that the main BMAC population contributed genetically to later South Asians. Instead, Steppe communities integrated farther south throughout the 2nd millennium BCE, and we show that they mixed with a more southern population that we document at multiple sites as outlier individuals exhibiting a distinctive mixture of ancestry related to Iranian agriculturalists and South Asian hunter-gathers. We call this group Indus Periphery because they were found at sites in cultural contact with the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) and along its northern fringe, and also because they were genetically similar to post-IVC groups in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. By co-analyzing ancient DNA and genomic data from diverse present-day South Asians, we show that Indus Periphery-related people are the single most important source of ancestry in South Asia--consistent with the idea that the Indus Periphery individuals are providing us with the first direct look at the ancestry of peoples of the IVC--and we develop a model for the formation of present-day South Asians in terms of the temporally and geographically proximate sources of Indus Periphery-related, Steppe, and local South Asian hunter-gatherer-related ancestry. Our results show how ancestry from the Steppe genetically linked Europe and South Asia in the Bronze Age, and identifies the populations that almost certainly were responsible for spreading Indo-European languages across much of Eurasia.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryGenome wide ancient DNA from 357 individuals from Central and South Asia sheds new light on the spread of Indo-European languages and parallels between the genetic history of two sub-continents, Europe and South Asia.","10.1126/science.aat7487"

This spontaneous diversification often occurs amid a backdrop of directional selection on other microbial traits, where competitive exclusion would normally apply. Yet despite their empirical relevance, little is known about how diversification and directional selection combine to determine the ecological and evolutionary dynamics within a community. To address this gap, we introduce a simple, empirically motivated model of eco-evolutionary feedback based on the competition for substitutable resources. Individuals acquire heritable mutations that alter resource uptake rates, either by shifting metabolic effort between resources or by increasing overall fitness. While these constitutively beneficial mutations are trivially favored to invade, we show that the accumulated fitness differences can dramatically influence the ecological structure and evolutionary dynamics that emerge within the community. Competition between ecological diversification and ongoing fitness evolution leads to a state of diversification-selection balance, in which the number of extant ecotypes can be pinned below the maximum capacity of the ecosystem, while the ecotype frequencies and genealogies are constantly in flux. Interestingly, we find that fitness differences generate emergent selection pressures to shift metabolic effort toward resources with lower effective competition, even in saturated ecosystems. We argue that similar dynamical features should emerge in a wide range of models with a mixture of directional and diversifying selection.","NA"

The second class of methods, summary statistic imputation, directly imputes the association statics at the untyped variants given the association statistics observed at the typed variants. This second class of methods is appealing as it tends to be computationally efficient while only requiring the summary statistics from a study while the former class requires access to individual-level data that can be difficult to obtain. The statistical properties of these two classes of imputation methods have not been fully understood. In this paper, we show that the two classes of imputation methods are equivalent, i.e., have identical asymptotic multivariate normal distributions with zero mean and minor variations in the covariance matrix, under some reasonable assumptions. Using this equivalence, we can understand the effect of imputation methods on power. We show that a commonly employed modification of summary statistic imputation that we term summary statistic imputation with variance re-weighting generally leads to a loss in power. On the other hand, our proposed method, summary statistic imputation without performing variance re-weighting, fully accounts for imputation uncertainty while achieving better power.","NA"

In this study, azotobacters, as being one potential biological regulator to enhance crops nitrogen utilization efficiency, were selected and the effects of Bt maize and non-Bt maize infected by Azospirillum brasilense and Azotobacter chroococcum on development and food utilization of target Mythimna separate were studied under ambient and elevated CO2. The results indicated that azotobacter infection significantly increased larval life-span, pupal duration, RCR and AD of M. separata, and significantly decreased RGR, ECD and ECI of M. separata fed on Bt maize; There were opposite trends in development and food utilization of M. separata fed on non-Bt maize infected with azotobacters compared with the buffer control regardless of CO2 level.

Females have higher risk of heart failure post myocardial infarction relative to males and the female sex is an independent risk factor for hospital and operative mortality after cardiac surgery. However, the mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain unclear. We examined sex differences in human myocardial gene expression in response to ischemia.\n\nMethodsLeft ventricular biopsies from 68 male and 46 female patients undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery were obtained at baseline and after a median 74 minutes of cold cardioplegic arrest/ischemia and respective transcriptomes were quantified by RNA-Seq. Sex-specific responses to ischemia were quantified by differential gene expression, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and pathway and functional analysis. Cell-type enrichment analysis. was used to obtain an estimate of the identity and relative proportions of different cell types present in each sample.\n\nResultsA sex-specific response to ischemia was observed for 271 genes. Functional annotation analysis revealed sex-specific modulation of the oxytocin signaling pathway and common pathway of fibrin clot formation. The eQTL analysis identified variant-by-sex interaction eQTLs at baseline and post-ischemia, indicative of sex differences in the genotypic effects on gene expression, and cell-type enrichment analysis showed sex-bias in proportion of specific cell types.\n\nConclusionIn response to myocardial ischemia, the human left ventricle demonstrates changes in gene expression that differ between the sexes. These differences provide insight into the sexual dimorphism of ischemic heart disease and may aid in the development of sex-specific therapies that reduce myocardial injury.","10.1093/hmg/ddz014"

Many of them are associated with poor outcome, in part because biomarkers that can reliably identify high-risk patients are lacking. Studies on sarcomas often are limited by small sample sizes rendering the identification of novel biomarkers difficult when focusing only on individual cohorts. However, the increasing number of publicly available  omics data opens inroads to overcome this obstacle.\n\nHere, we combine high-throughput transcriptome analyses, immunohistochemistry, and functional assays to show that high adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2 (AMPD2) is a robust prognostic biomarker for worse patient outcome in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). Publicly available gene expression and survival data for UPS from two independent studies, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the CINSARC reference dataset, were subjected to survival association testing. Genes, whose high expression was significantly correlated with worse outcome in both cohorts (overall and metastasis-free survival), were considered as prognostic marker candidates. The best candidate, AMPD2, was validated on protein level in an independent tissue microarray. Analysis of DNA copy-number and matched gene expression data indicated that high AMPD2 expression is significantly correlated with copy-number gains at the AMPD2 locus. Gene-set enrichment analyses of AMPD2 co-expressed genes in both UPS gene expression datasets suggested that highly AMPD2 expressing tumors are enriched in gene signatures involved in tumorigenesis. Consistent with this prediction in primary tumors, knockdown of AMPD2 by RNA interference with pooled siRNAs or a doxycycline-inducible shRNA construct in the UPS cell line FPS-1 markedly inhibited proliferation in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo.\n\nCollectively, these results provide evidence that AMPD2 may serve as a novel biomarker for outcome prediction in UPS. Our study exemplifies how the integration of available  omics data, immunohistochemical analyses, and functional experiments can identify novel biomarkers even in a rare sarcoma, which may serve as a blueprint for biomarker identification for other rare cancers.","10.1002/ijc.31903"

LPWC aligns pairs of time series profiles to identify common temporal patterns. It down-weights aligned profiles based on the length of the temporal lags that are introduced. We demonstrate the advantages of LPWC versus existing time series and general clustering algorithms.

J.","Han B Lee","Mayo Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences","2018-03-31",1,"4","new results","neuroscience","When vertebrates face acute stressors, their bodies rapidly undergo a repertoire of physiological and behavioral adaptations, which is termed the stress response (SR). Rapid physiological changes in heart rate and blood sugar levels occur via the interaction of glucocorticoids and their cognate receptors following hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation. These physiological changes are observed within minutes of encountering a stressor and the rapid time domain rules out genomic responses that require gene expression changes. Although behavioral changes corresponding to physiological changes are commonly observed, it is not clearly understood to what extent HPA axis activation dictates adaptive behavior. We hypothesized that rapid locomotor response to acute stressors in zebrafish requires HPI axis activation. In teleost fish, interrenal cells (I) are functionally homologous to the adrenal gland cortical layer. We derived 8 frameshift mutants in genes involved in HPI axis function: two mutants in exon 2 of mc2r (adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor), two in each of exon 2 and exon 5 of nr3c1 (glucocorticoid receptor), and two in exon 2 of nr3c2 (mineralocorticoid receptor). Exposing larval zebrafish to mild environmental stressors, acute changes in salinity or light illumination, results in a rapid locomotor response. We show here that this locomotor response requires a functioning HPI axis via the action of mc2r (adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor) and the canonical glucocorticoid receptor encoded by nr3c1 gene, but not mineralocorticoid receptor (nr3c2). Our rapid behavioral assay paradigm based on HPI axis biology may prove useful to screen for genetic, pharmacological, or environmental modifiers of the HPA axis.\n\nSignificanceAltered HPA axis activity is acknowledged as a causative and critical prognostic factor in many psychiatric disorders including depression. Nonetheless, genome wide association studies (GWAS) on depression have revealed conflicting findings about susceptibility loci, while identifying several genetic loci that warrant further investigations in the process. Such findings indicate that psychiatric disorders with complex genetic foundations require functional studies as well as genetic analyses. We developed a sensitive behavioral assay paradigm that leverages the genetic amenability and rapid development of zebrafish and demonstrated that our assay system reliably detects changes in HPA axis responsiveness. Our functional genetics and behavioral assay approach provides a useful platform to discover novel genetic, pharmacological, or environmental modifiers of the HPA axis.","NA"

M.; Riley, S.","Steven Riley","Imperial College London","2018-03-31",1,"15","new results","epidemiology","Infectious disease transmission in animals is an inherently spatial process in which a hosts home location and their social mixing patterns are important, with the mixing of infectious individuals often different to that of susceptible individuals. Although incidence data for humans have traditionally been aggregated into low-resolution data sets, modern representative surveillance systems such as electronic hospital records generate high volume case data with precise home locations. Here, we use a high resolution gridded spatial transmission model of arbitrary resolution to investigate the theoretical relationship between population density, differential population movement and local variability in incidence. We show analytically that uniform local attack rate is only possible for individual pixels in the grid if susceptible and infectious individuals move in the same way. Using a population in Guangdong, China, for which a robust quantitative description of movement is available (a movement kernel), and a natural history consistent with pandemic influenza; we show that for the estimated kernel, local cumulative incidence is positively correlated with population density when susceptible individuals are more connected in space than infectious individuals. Conversely, when infectious individuals are more connected, local cumulative incidence is negatively correlated with population density. The amplitude of correlation is substantial for the estimated kernel. However, the strength and direction of correlation changes sign for other kernel parameter values. These results describe a precise relationship between the spatio-social mixing of infectious and susceptible individuals and local variability in attack rates, and suggest a plausible mechanism for the counter-intuitive scenario in which local incidence is lower on average in less dense populations. Also, these results suggest that if spatial transmission models are implemented at high resolution to investigate local disease dynamics, including micro-tuning of interventions, the underlying detailed assumptions about the mechanisms of transmission become more important than when similar studies are conducted at larger spatial scales.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe know that some places have higher rates of infectious disease than others. However, at the moment, we usually only measure these differences for large towns and cities. With modern data, such as those we can get from mobile phones, we can measure rates of infection at much smaller scales. In this paper, we used a computer simulation of an epidemic to propose ways that rates of incidence in small local areas might be related to population density. We found that if infectious people are better connected than non-infectious people, perhaps because they receive visitors, then, on average, higher density areas would have lower rates of infection. If infectious people were less connected than non-infectious people then higher density areas would have higher rates of infection. As data get more accurate, this type of analysis will allow us to propose and test ways to optimize interventions such as the delivery of vaccines and antivirals during a pandemic.","NA"

Here we describe the case of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), a deadly neglected tropical disease due to a trypanosome transmitted by tsetse flies for which no vaccine nor chemoprophylaxis exists. Data are presented for the disease focus of Boffa in Guinea where a pilot elimination project combining medical screening and vector control was launched in 2012. During ebola, HAT active screening activities were postponed and passive surveillance also was progressively impaired. However, tsetse control using small insecticide impregnated targets could be maintained. The over two years disruption of screening activities led to a dramatic increase of HAT prevalence, from 0.7% in 2013 (21/2885) to 2% (69/3448) in 2016, reaching epidemic levels (>5%) in some villages. In deep contrast, control levels reached in 2013 (0.1%; 7/6564) were maintained in areas covered with impregnated targets as no cases were found in 2016 (0/799). In Boffa, ebola has thus incidentally provided a unique framework to assess the impact of current HAT control strategies. A first lesson is that the \""screen and treat\"" strategy is fragile as rapid bursts of the disease may occur in case of disruption. A second lesson is that vector control reducing human-tsetse contacts, even implemented alone, is effective in providing a good level of protection against infection. This advocates for a greater attention being paid to the combination of tsetse control together with medical activities in aiming to reach the HAT elimination objective in Africa.","NA"

Studies were included if they examined preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500g) infants and reported primary data that could be used to measure the association between exposure to CA and the presence of ROP. Of 748 potentially relevant studies, 50 studies met the inclusion criteria (38,986 infants, 9,258 CA cases). Meta-analysis showed a significant positive association between CA and any stage ROP (odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 1.74). CA was also associated with severe (stage [&ge;]3) ROP (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.89). Exposure to funisitis was associated with a higher risk of ROP than exposure to CA in the absence of funisitis. Additional meta-analyses showed that infants exposed to CA had lower gestational age (GA) and lower birth weight (BW). Meta-regression showed that lower GA and BW in the CA-exposed group was significantly associated with a higher risk of ROP. In conclusion, our study confirms that CA is a risk factor for developing ROP. However, part of the effects of CA on the pathogenesis of ROP may be mediated by the role of CA as an etiological factor for very preterm birth.","10.1371/journal.pone.0205838"

No purified vaccine antigens exist for R. equi or Mtb infections. Both express the microbial surface polysaccharide antigen poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG). Vaccination of pregnant mares with a synthetic PNAG oligosaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid elicited antibody that transferred to foals via colostrum and provided nearly complete protection against R. equi pneumonia in a randomized, controlled, blinded challenge trial. Infusion of PNAG-hyperimmune plasma protected 100% of foals against R. equi pneumonia. Vaccination induced opsonic antibodies that killed extracellular and intracellular R. equi and other intracellular pathogens. Killing of intracellular organisms was dependent on antibody recognition of surface expression of PNAG on infected macrophages, complement deposition and PMN-assisted lysis of infected macrophages. Protection also correlated with PBMC release of interferon-{gamma} in response to PNAG. Antibody-mediated opsonic killing and interferon-{gamma} release in response to PNAG may protect against disease caused by intracellular bacterial pathogens.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007160"

Amongst differentially-regulated cellular genes, we observed up-regulation of all arms of the unfolded protein response (UPR), including translational activation of transcription factors ATF4, ATF5 and Chop. Polysome profiling of infected-cells revealed an accumulation of empty 80S ribosomes, consistent with increased phosphorylation of eIF2 leading to translational shut-off via inhibited initiation. Ribosomal footprints on phosphorylated-eIF2-resistant mRNAs revealed unambiguous upstream open reading frame (uORF) occupancy consistent with host maintenance of the UPR. Unexpectedly, an inhibitor of PERK that blocks the UPR and relieves translation inhibition was found to attenuate virus growth suggesting that MHV may subvert the UPR to its own advantage. This study sheds new light on the complex interactions between MHV and host during infection and provides new potential targets for antiviral intervention.","NA"

Diverse cells types have been shown to regulate their numbers via secretion of factors in the extracellular space. These factors act as a proxy for the number of cells and function to reduce cellular proliferation rates creating a negative feedback. It is desirable that the production rate of such factors be kept as low as possible to minimize energy costs and detection by predators. Here we formulate a stochastic model of cell proliferation with feedback control via a secreted extracellular factor. Our results show that while low levels of feedback minimizes random fluctuations in cell numbers around a given set point, high levels of feedback amplify Poisson fluctuations in secreted-factor copy numbers. This trade-off results in an optimal feedback strength, and sets a fundamental limit to noise suppression in cell numbers. Intriguingly, this fundamental limit depends additively on two variables: relative half-life of the secreted factor with respect to the cell proliferation rate, and the average number of factors secreted in a cells lifespan. We further expand the model to consider external disturbances in key physiological parameters, such as, proliferation and factor synthesis rates. Intriguingly, while negative feedback effectively mitigates disturbances in the proliferation rate, it amplifies disturbances in the synthesis rate. In summary, these results provide unique insights into the functioning of feedback-based counting mechanisms, and apply to organisms ranging from unicellular prokaryotes and eukaryotes to human cells.","NA"

Experiments are shedding light on this diversity at ever finer scales, but interpretation is challenging. Using recent progress in numerical models, we simulate macroscopic tumors to investigate the interplay between growth dynamics, microscopic composition, and circulating tumor cell cluster diversity. We find that modest differences in growth parameters can profoundly change microscopic diversity. Simple outwards expansion leads to spatially segregated clones and low diversity, as expected. However, a modest cell turnover can result in an increased number of divisions and mixing among clones resulting in increased microscopic diversity in the tumor core. Using simulations to estimate power to detect such spatial trends, we find that multiregion sequencing data from contemporary studies is marginally powered to detect the predicted effects. Slightly larger samples, improved detection of rare variants, or sequencing of smaller biopsies or circulating tumor cell clusters would allow one to distinguish between leading models of tumor evolution. The genetic composition of circulating tumor cell clusters, which can be obtained from non-invasive blood draws, is therefore informative about tumor evolution and its metastatic potential.\n\nHighlightsO_LINumerical and theoretical models show interaction of front expansion, mutation, and clonal mixing in shaping tumor heterogeneity.\nC_LIO_LICell turnover increases intratumor heterogeneity.\nC_LIO_LISimulated circulating tumor cell clusters and microbiopsies exhibit substantial diversity with strong spatial trends.\nC_LIO_LISimulations suggest attainable sampling schemes able to distinguish between prevalent tumor growth models.\nC_LI","10.1093/molbev/msy115"

This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure.

Current dominant models of connectivity are based on coarse-scale connectivity among brain regions, ignoring fine-scale structure within those regions. We developed a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome that captures both coarse and fine-scale structure of connectivity shared across brains. We showed that this shared fine-scale structure is related to fine-scale distinctions in representation of information, and our model accounts for substantially more shared variance of connectivity compared to previous models.

Remarkably, ~30 milliseconds after the initially evoked response, we found that neurons in intermediate level areas decreased their preference for faces, becoming anti-face preferring on average even while neurons in higher level areas achieved and maintained a face preference. This pattern of hierarchical neural dynamics was inconsistent with extensions of standard feedforward circuits that implemented recurrence within a cortical stage. Rather, recurrent models computing errors between stages captured the observed temporal signatures.

Here, we discuss general principles that underlie the tradeoff between encoding cost and inference error. We then derive adaptive encoding schemes that dynamically navigate this tradeoff. These optimal encodings tend to increase the fidelity of the neural representation following a change in the stimulus distribution, and reduce fidelity for stimuli that originate from a known distribution.

The invasion of the Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois volitans, into waters off the U.S. East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea provides a natural system to study rapid range expansion in an invasive marine fish with high dispersal capabilities. We report results from 12,759 loci sequenced by restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing for nine P. volitans populations in the invaded range, including Florida and other Caribbean sites, as well as mitochondrial control region D-loop data. Analyses revealed low to no spatially explicit metapopulation genetic structure in the study area, which is partly consistent with previous finding of little structure within ocean basins, but partly divergent from reports of between-basin structure. Genetic diversity, however, was not homogeneous across all sampled sites. Patterns of genetic diversity correlate with invasion pathway. Observed heterozygosity, averaged across all loci within a population, decreases with distance from Florida while expected heterozygosity is mostly constant throughout sampled populations, indicating population genetic disequilibrium correlated with distance from the point of invasion. Using an FST outlier analysis and a Bayesian environmental correlation analysis, we identified 256 and 616 loci, respectively, that could be experiencing selection or genetic drift.

L.","Lori L. Burrows","McMaster University","2018-04-01",2,"3","new results","microbiology","Type IV pili are expressed by a wide range of prokaryotes, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These flexible fibres mediate twitching motility, biofilm maturation, surface adhesion, and virulence. The pilus is composed mainly of major pilin subunits while the low abundance minor pilins FimU-PilVWXE and the putative adhesin PilY1 prime pilus assembly and are proposed to form the pilus tip. The minor pilins and PilY1 are encoded in an operon that is positively regulated by the FimS-AlgR two-component system. Independent of pilus assembly, PilY1 is proposed to be a mechanosensory component that - in conjunction with minor pilins - triggers up-regulation of acute virulence phenotypes upon surface attachment. Here, we investigated the link between the minor pilins and virulence. pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants had reduced virulence towards Caenorhabditis elegans relative to wild type or a major pilin mutant, implying a role in pathogenicity that is independent of pilus assembly. We hypothesized that loss of specific minor pilins relieves feedback inhibition on FimS-AlgR, increasing transcription of the minor pilin operon and other members of the AlgR regulon. Reporter assays confirmed that FimS-AlgR were required for the increased expression from the minor pilin operon promoter upon loss of select minor pilins. Overexpression of AlgR or its hyperactivation via point mutation reduced virulence, and the virulence defects of pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants were dependent on FimS-AlgR expression and activation. We propose that PilY1 and the minor pilins inhibit their own expression, and that loss of these proteins leads to FimS-mediated activation of AlgR and reduced expression of acute-phase virulence factors. This mechanism could contribute to adaptation of P. aeruginosa in chronic lung infections, as mutations in the minor pilin operon result in the loss of piliation and increased expression of AlgR-dependent virulence factors - such as alginate - that are characteristic of such infections.\n\nAuthor summaryPseudomonas aeruginosa causes dangerous infections, including chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. It uses many strategies to infect its hosts, including deployment of grappling hook-like fibres called type IV pili. Among the components involved in assembly and function of the pilus are five proteins called minor pilins that - along with a larger protein called PilY1 - may help the pilus attach to surfaces. In a roundworm infection model, loss of PilY1 and specific minor pilins delayed killing, while loss of other pilus proteins did not. We traced this effect to increased activation of the FimS-AlgR regulatory system that inhibits expression of virulence factors used to initiate infections, while positively regulating chronic infection traits such as alginate production, a phenotype called mucoidy. A disruption in the appropriate timing of FimS-AlgR-dependent virulence factor expression when select minor pilins or PilY1 are missing may explain why those pilus-deficient mutants have reduced virulence compared with others whose products are not under FimS-AlgR control. Increased FimS-AlgR activity upon loss of PilY1 and specific minor pilins could help to explain the frequent co-occurrence of the non-piliated and mucoid phenotypes that are hallmarks of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007074"

Where observations do exist, they mostly represent descriptions of fire effects on plant communities before the introduction of invasive species in the modern era. Understanding the effects of wildfire in southeastern Polynesian island vegetation communities can elucidate which species may become problematic invasives with continued wildfire activity. We investigate the effects of wildfire on vegetation in three low-elevation sites (45-379 m) on the island of Moorea in the Society Islands, French Polynesia, which are already heavily impacted by past human land use and invasive exotic plants, but retain some native flora. In six study areas (3 burned and 3 unburned comparisons), we placed 30 transects across sites and collected species and abundance information at 390 points. We analyzed each local community of plants in three categories: natives, those introduced by Polynesians before European contact (1767 C.E.), and those introduced since European contact. Burned areas had the same or lower mean species richness than paired comparison sites. Although wildfire did not affect the proportions of native and introduced species, it may increase the abundance of introduced species on some sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling indicates that (not recently modified) comparison plant communities are more distinct from one another than are those on burned sites. We discuss conservation concerns for particular native plants absent from burned sites, as well as invasive species (including Lantana camara and Paraserianthes falcataria) that may be promoted by fire in the Pacific.","10.7717/peerj.5114"

H.","Heather S Bruce","UC Berkeley","2018-04-01",6,"15","new results","developmental biology","The origin of insect wings has long been debated. Central to this debate is whether wings evolved from an epipod (outgrowth, e.g., a gill) on ancestral crustacean leg segments, or represent a novel outgrowth from the dorsal body wall that co-opted some of the genes used to pattern the epipods. To determine whether wings can be traced to ancestral, pre-insect structures, or arose by co-option, comparisons are necessary between insects and arthropods more representative of the ancestral state, where the hypothesized proximal leg region is not fused to the body wall. To do so, we examined the function of five leg patterning genes in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and compared this to previous functional data from insects. By comparing gene knockout phenotypes of leg patterning genes in a crustacean with those of insects, we show that two ancestral crustacean leg segments were incorporated into the insect body, moving the legs epipod dorsally, up onto the back to form insect wings. Thus, our data shows that much of the body wall of insects, including the entire wing, is derived from these two ancestral proximal leg segments. This model explains all observations in favor of either the body wall origin or proximal leg origin of insect wings. Thus, our results show that insect wings are not novel structures, but instead evolved from existing, ancestral structures.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryCRISPR-Cas9 knockout of leg gap genes in a crustacean reveals that insect wings are not novel structures, they evolved from crustacean leg segments","NA"

For example, macroscale connectomics studies require complex pipelines to process raw functional or diffusion data and estimate connectomes. Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility, which add to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies and result in failures to replicate (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols). Mitigating these issues requires multi-study datasets and the development of pipelines that can be applied across them. We developed NeuroDatas MRI to Graphs (NDMG) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducability, to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, NDMG ran on 25 different studies ({approx}6,000 scans) from 19 sites, with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from NDMG are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that NDMG is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections. Yet, the magnitude of the differences varied across individuals and studies--much more so when pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study, site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We therefore provide a set of principles to guide the development of pipelines capable of pooling data across studies while maintaining biological variability and minimizing measurement error. This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.","NA"

NMD is a cellular mRNA surveillance mechanism that is required for normal brain size in mice2-4. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we identified multiple cellular NMD factors that bind to the viral capsid protein, including the central NMD regulator up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1)5. Endogenous UPF1 interacted with the viral capsid protein in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and capsid expression post-transcriptionally downregulated UPF1, a process that we confirmed occurs during de novo ZIKV infection. A further decrease in UPF1 levels by RNAi significantly enhanced ZIKV infection in NPC cultures. We therefore propose that ZIKV, via the capsid protein, has evolved a strategy to dampen antiviral activities of NMD6,7, which subsequently contributes to neuropathology in vivo.","10.1128/mbio.02126-18"

We examined whether MDM2 and/or CDK4 produce WDLPS/DDLPS using transformed human bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), 2H and 5H, with five oncogenic hits (overexpression of hTERT, TP53 degradation, RB inactivation, c-MYC stabilization, and overexpression of HRASv12). In vitro functional experiments revealed that co-overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 plays key roles in tumorigenesis by increasing cell growth and migration and inhibiting adipogenic differentiation potency compared to sole expression of MDM2 or CDK4. Using mouse xenograft models, we found that co-overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 in 5H cells with five additional oncogenic mutations can develop proliferative DDLPS in vivo.

For example, in budding yeast, the rate of cell growth is proportional to nutrient availability, cell size is proportional to growth rate, and growth rate is proportional to cell size. Thus, cells grow slowly in poor nutrients and are nearly half the size of cells growing in rich nutrients. Moreover, large cells grow faster than small cells. A signaling network that surrounds Tor kinase complex 2 (TORC2) plays an important role in enforcing these proportional relationships. Cells that lack components of the TORC2 network fail to modulate their growth rate or size in response to changes in nutrient availability. Here, we show that budding yeast homologs of the Lkb1 tumor suppressor kinase are required for normal modulation of TORC2 signaling and in response to changes in carbon source. Lkb1 kinases activate Snf1/AMPK to initiate transcription of genes required for utilization of poor carbon sources. However, Lkb1 influences TORC2 signaling via a novel pathway that is independent of Snf1/AMPK. Of the three Lkb1 homologs in budding yeast, Elm1 plays the most important role in modulating TORC2. Elm1 activates a pair of related kinases called Gin4 and Hsl1. Previous work found that loss of Gin4 and Hsl1 causes cells to undergo unrestrained growth during a prolonged mitotic arrest, which suggests that play a role in linking cell cycle progression to cell growth. We found that Gin4 and Hsl1 also control the TORC2 network. In addition, Gin4 and Hsl1 are themselves influenced by signals from the TORC2 network, consistent with previous work showing that the TORC2 network constitutes a feedback loop. Together, the data suggest a model in which the TORC2 network sets growth rate in response to carbon source, while also relaying signals via Gin4 and Hsl1 that set the critical amount of growth required for cell cycle progression. This kind of close linkage between control of cell growth and size would suggest a simple mechanistic explanation for the proportional relationship between cell size and growth rate.","10.1534/genetics.118.301296"

In differential alternative splicing, the relative abundance of transcript variants differs across sample types. Differential alternative splicing is common in animal systems and influences cellular development in many processes, but its extent and significance is not as well known in plants. To investigate alternative splicing in plants, we examined rice seedling RNA-Seq data that included approximately 40 million sequence alignments per library, three libraries per sample type, and four sample types: roots and shoots, each treated with exogenous cytokinin delivered hydroponically, plus mock-treated controls. Cytokinin treatment triggered expression changes in thousands of genes, but had minimal effect on alternative splicing. However, there were many splicing differences between roots and shoots. Analysis of a similar (but less deeply sequenced) mRNA-Seq data set from Arabidopsis showed the same pattern. Quantitative fragment analysis of reverse transcriptase-PCR products made from newly prepared rice samples confirmed nine of ten differential splicing events between rice roots and shoots. In both the Arabidopsis and rice mRNA-Seq data sets, most genes annotated as alternatively spliced had small minor variant frequencies, i.e., the less frequently observed forms were supported by fewer than 20% of informative mRNA-Seq sequences. Of splicing choices where there was more abundant support for minor forms, most alternative splicing events were located within the protein-coding sequence and also maintained the annotated reading frame. A tool for visualizing protein annotations in the context of genomic sequence (ProtAnnot) together with a genome browser (Integrated Genome Browser) were used to visualize and assess effects of differential splicing on gene function. In general, differentially spliced regions coincided with conserved regions in the encoded proteins, indicating that differential alternative splicing is likely to affect protein function between root and shoot tissue in rice.","10.1002/pld3.136"

In addition, baseline performance level of the participant has been shown to play a role in modulating the impact of TMS. Here we examined the link between these two. This was done using data from a previous study using a TMS-priming paradigm, in which, at group level, TMS selectively facilitated targets incongruent with the prime while having no statistically significant effects on other prime-target congruencies. Correlation and linear mixed-effects analyses indicated that, for all prime-target congruencies, a significant linear relationship between baseline performance and the magnitude of the induced TMS effect was present: low levels of baseline performance were associated with TMS-induced facilitations and high baseline performance with impairments. Thus as performance level increased, TMS effects turned from facilitation to impairment. The key finding was that priming shifted the transition from facilitatory to disruptive effects for targets incongruent with the prime, such that TMS-induced facilitations were obtained until a higher level of performance than for other prime-target congruencies. Given that brain state manipulations such as priming operate via modulations of neural excitability, this result is consistent with the view that neural excitability, coupled with nonlinear neural effects, underlie behavioral effects of TMS.","10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00741"

However, the information entered against these ID variables is prone to change for several reasons, such as when claimants find or change employment, or due to variations in the spelling of their name. In the present study, we developed a new patient-matching technique that improves upon the existing system of using ID1 and ID2 variables. We also sought to validate a new personal ID variable (ID0) that we propose in order to enhance the efficiency of patient matching in the NDB database.\n\nMethodsOur study targeted data from health insurance claims filed between April 2013 and March 2016 for hospitalization, combined diagnostic procedures, outpatient treatment, and dispensing of prescription medication. We developed a new patient-matching algorithm based on the ID1 and ID2 variables, as well as variables for treatment date and clinical outcome. We then attempted to validate our algorithm by comparing the number of patients identified by patient matching with the current ID1 variable and our proposed ID0 variable against the estimated patient population as of 1 October 2015.\n\nResultsThe numbers of patients in each sex and age group that were identified with the ID0 variable were lower than those identified using the ID1 variable. By using the ID0 variable, we were able to reduce the number of duplicate records for male and female patients by 5.8% and 6.4%, respectively. The numbers of children, adults older than 75 years, and women of reproductive age identified using the ID1 patient-matching variable were all higher than their corresponding estimates. Conversely, the numbers of these patients identified with the ID0 patient-matching variable were all within their corresponding estimates.\n\nConclusionOur findings show that the proposed ID0 variable delivers more precise patient-matching results than the existing ID1 variable. The ID0 variable is currently the best available technique for patient matching in the NDB database. Future patient population estimates should therefore rely on the ID0 variable instead of the ID1 variable.","NA"

The current P. abies genome assembly (v1.0) covers approximately 60% of the total genome size but is highly fragmented, consisting of >10 million scaffolds. The genome annotation contains 66,632 gene models that are at least partially validated (www.congenie.org), however, the fragmented nature of the assembly means that there is currently little information available on how these genes are physically distributed over the 12 P. abies chromosomes. By creating an ultra-dense genetic linkage map, we anchored and ordered scaffolds into linkage groups, which complements the fine-scale information available in assembly contigs. Our ultra-dense haploid consensus genetic map consists of 21,056 markers derived from 14,336 scaffolds that contain 17,079 gene models (25.6% of the validated gene models) that we have anchored to the 12 linkage groups. We used data from three independent component maps, as well as comparisons with previously published Picea maps to evaluate the accuracy and marker ordering of the linkage groups. We demonstrate that approximately 3.8% of the anchored scaffolds and 1.6% of the gene models covered by the consensus map have likely assembly errors as they contain genetic markers that map to different regions within or between linkage groups. We further evaluate the utility of the genetic map for the conifer research community by using an independent data set of unrelated individuals to assess genome-wide variation in genetic diversity using the genomic regions anchored to linkage groups.

Generally, learning Bayesian networks from experimental data is NP-hard, leading to widespread use of heuristic search methods giving suboptimal results. However, in cases when the acyclicity of the graph can be externally ensured, it is possible to find the optimal network in polynomial time. While our previously developed tool BNFinder implements polynomial time algorithm, reconstructing networks with the large amount of experimental data still leads to computations on single CPU growing exceedingly.\n\nResultsIn the present paper we propose parallelized algorithm designed for multi-core and distributed systems and its implementation in the improved version of BNFinder - tool for learning optimal Bayesian networks. The new algorithm has been tested on different simulated and experimental datasets showing that it has much better efficiency of parallelization than the previous version.

No purified vaccine antigens exist for R. equi or Mtb infections. Both express the microbial surface polysaccharide antigen poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG). Vaccination of pregnant mares with a synthetic PNAG oligosaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid elicited antibody that transferred to foals via colostrum and provided nearly complete protection against R. equi pneumonia in a randomized, controlled, blinded challenge trial. Infusion of PNAG-hyperimmune plasma protected 100% of foals against R. equi pneumonia. Vaccination induced opsonic antibodies that killed extracellular and intracellular R. equi and other intracellular pathogens. Killing of intracellular organisms was dependent on antibody recognition of surface expression of PNAG on infected macrophages, complement deposition and PMN-assisted lysis of infected macrophages. Protection also correlated with PBMC release of interferon-{gamma} in response to PNAG.

One powerful method to develop these models is transgenesis; however, selection of a suitable promoter to drive transgene expression is critical. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter is the most commonly used viral promoter as it robustly drives transgene expression in a ubiquitous nature. However, recent reports suggest that the level of CMV promoter activity is tissue-dependent in the pig. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the activity of the CMV promoter in a wide range of porcine tissues. Swine harboring a CMV-ZsGreen1 transgene with a single integration site were utilized for this study. Thirty five tissue samples were collected from neonatal hemizygous (n = 3) and homozygous (n = 3) transgenic piglets and analyzed for ZsGreen1 abundance via immunoblot.\n\nResultsZsGreen1 was detected in all tissues examined; however, quantification revealed that ZsGreen1 protein levels were tissue-specific. Within organs of the digestive system, for example, ZsGreen1 was most abundant in the salivary gland, moderately produced in the esophagus and levels were lowest in the stomach. Interestingly, abundance of ZsGreen1 also differed within organ. For instance, levels were highest in the right ventricle compared with other chambers of the heart. There was no effect of transgene dose as ZsGreen1 expression patterns were similar between homozygous and hemizygous piglets.\n\nConclusionsUltimately, these results elucidate the tissue-specific activity of the CMV promoter in the neonatal pig. Moreover, this model can serve as a useful tool for research applications requiring reporter gene activity in mammalian organs.","NA"

S.","Iris I A Groen","New York University","2018-04-02",1,"15","new results","neuroscience","Object recognition is thought to be mediated by rapid feed-forward activation of object-selective cortex, with limited contribution of feedback. However, disruption of visual evoked activity beyond feed-forward processing stages has been demonstrated to affect object recognition performance. Here, we unite these findings by reporting that the detection of target objects in natural scenes is selectively characterized by enhanced feedback when these objects are embedded in high complexity scenes. Human participants performed an animal target detection task on scenes with low, medium or high complexity as determined by a biologically plausible computational model of low-level contrast statistics. Three converging lines of evidence indicate that feedback was enhanced during categorization of scenes with high, but not low or medium complexity. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in early visual cortex (V1) was selectively enhanced for target objects in scenes with high complexity. Second, event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by high complexity scenes were selectively enhanced from 220 ms after stimulus-onset. Third, behavioral performance deteriorated for highly complex scenes when participants were pressed for time, but not when they could process the scenes fully and thereby benefit from the enhanced feedback. Formal modeling of the reaction time distributions revealed that object information accumulated more slowly for high complexity scenes (resulting in more errors especially for fast decisions), and directly related to the build-up of the feedback activity that was observed exclusively for high complexity scenes. Together, these results suggest that while feed-forward activity may suffice for simple scenes, the brain employs recurrent processing more adaptively in naturalistic settings, using minimal feedback for sparse, coherent scenes and increasing feedback for complex, fragmented scenes.\n\nAuthor summaryHow much neural processing is required to detect objects of interest in natural scenes? The astonishing speed of object recognition suggests that fast feed-forward buildup of perceptual activity is sufficient. However, this view is contradicted by findings that show that disruption of slower neural feedback leads to decreased detection performance. Our study unites these discrepancies by identifying scene complexity as a critical driver of neural feedback. We show how feedback is enhanced for complex, cluttered scenes compared to simple, well-organized scenes. Moreover, for complex scenes, more feedback is associated with better performances. These findings relate the flexibility of neural processes to perceptual decision-making by demonstrating that the brain dynamically directs neural resources based on the complexity of real-world visual inputs.","NA"

D.","Marylyn D Ritchie","University of Pennsylvania","2018-04-02",1,"15","new results","bioinformatics","BackgroundMachine learning methods have gained popularity and practicality in identifying linear and non-linear effects of variants associated with complex disease/traits. Detection of epistatic interactions still remains a challenge due to the large number of features and relatively small sample size as input, thus leading to the so-called \""short fat data\"" problem. The efficiency of machine learning methods can be increased by limiting the number of input features. Thus, it is very important to perform variable selection before searching for epistasis. Many methods have been evaluated and proposed to perform feature selection, but no single method works best in all scenarios. We demonstrate this by conducting two separate simulation analyses to evaluate the proposed collective feature selection approach.\n\nResultsThrough our simulation study we propose a collective feature selection approach to select features that are in the \""union\"" of the best performing methods. We explored various parametric, non-parametric, and data mining approaches to perform feature selection. We choose our top performing methods to select the union of the resulting variables based on a user-defined percentage of variants selected from each method to take to downstream analysis. Our simulation analysis shows that non-parametric data mining approaches, such as MDR, may work best under one simulation criteria for the high effect size (penetrance) datasets, while non-parametric methods designed for feature selection, such as Ranger and Gradient boosting, work best under other simulation criteria. Thus, using a collective approach proves to be more beneficial for selecting variables with epistatic effects also in low effect size datasets and different genetic architectures. Following this, we applied our proposed collective feature selection approach to select the top 1% of variables to identify potential interacting variables associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in ~44,000 samples obtained from Geisingers MyCode Community Health Initiative (on behalf of DiscovEHR collaboration).\n\nConclusionsIn this study, we were able to show that selecting variables using a collective feature selection approach could help in selecting true positive epistatic variables more frequently than applying any single method for feature selection via simulation studies. We were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of collective feature selection along with a comparison of many methods in our simulation analysis. We also applied our method to identify non-linear networks associated with obesity.","10.1186/s13040-018-0168-6"

We propose a quantitative MRI approach for measuring the diameters and flow velocities of PAs based on model based analysis of complex difference images in phase contrast MRI. The complex difference image of each PA is fitted by a model image calculated by taking into account the partial volume effect and signal enhancement due to in flow effects to obtain velocity [Formula], diameter (D), and volume flow rate (VFR) of the PAs.

Many organisms display codon usage bias (CUB), where synonymous codons that are translated into the same amino acid appear with distinct frequency. CUB is thought to arise from selection for translational efficiency and accuracy, termed the translational efficiency hypothesis (TEH). Indeed, CUB indices correlate with protein expression levels, which is widely interpreted as evidence for translational selection. However, these tests neglect -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), an important translational disruption effect found across all organisms of the tree of life. Genes that contain -1 PRF signals should cost more to express than genes without. Thus, CUB indices that do not consider -1 PRF may overestimate genes true adaptation to translational efficiency and accuracy constraints. Here, we first investigate whether -1 PRF signals do indeed carry such translational cost. We then propose two corrections for CUB indices for genes containing -1 PRF signals. We retest the TEH under these corrections. We find that the correlation between corrected CUB index and protein expression remains intact for most levels of uniform -1 PRF efficiencies, and tends to increase when these efficiencies decline with protein expression. We conclude that the TEH is strengthened and that -1 PRF events constitute a promising and useful tool to examine the relationships between CUB and selection for translation efficiency and accuracy.","10.1534/g3.118.200185"

Whereas probabilistic genome evolution models provided theoretical foundation to comparative genomics studies, it remains challenging to extend DNA evolution models to epigenomes.\n\nResultsWe present an effort to develop ab initio evolution models for epigenomes, by explicitly expressing the joint probability of multispecies DNA sequences and histone modifications on homologous genomic regions. This joint probability is modeled as a mixture of four components representing four evolutionary hypotheses, namely dependence and independence of interspecies epigenomic variations to sequence mutations and to sequence insertions and deletions (indels). For model fitting, we implemented a maximum likelihood method by coupling downhill simplex algorithm with dynamic programming. Based on likelihood comparisons, the model can be used to infer whether interspecies epigenomic variations depend on mutation or indels in local genomic sequences. We applied this model to analyze DNase hypersensitive regions and spermatid H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from human and rhesus macaque. Approximately 5.5% of homologous regions in the genomes exhibited H3K4me3 modification in either species, among which approximately 67% homologous regions exhibited sequence-dependent interspecies H3K4me3 variations. Mutations accounted for less sequence-dependent H3K4me3 variations than indels. Among transposon-mediated indels, ERV1 insertions and L1 insertions were most strongly associated with H3K4me3 gains and losses, respectively.\n\nConclusionThis work initiates a class of probabilistic evolution models that jointly model the genomes and the epigenomes, thus helps to bring evolutionary principles to comparative epigenomic studies.","NA"

Some maternal mRNAs are determinants of somatic or germline fate and must be translationally repressed until embryogenesis. However, the translational repressors themselves are also temporally regulated. We use polar granule component (pgc), a Drosophila maternal mRNA, as a model system to ask how maternal mRNAs are repressed while the regulatory landscape is continually shifting. pgc, a potent transcriptional silencer and germline determinant, is translationally regulated throughout oogenesis. We find that the 3UTR of pgc mRNA contains a conserved ten-nucleotide sequence that is bound by different conserved RNA binding proteins (RBPs) at different stages of oogenesis to continuously repress translation except for a brief expression in the stem cell daughter. Pumilio (Pum) binds to this sequence in undifferentiated and early differentiating oocytes and recruits other temporally restricted translational regulators to block pgc translation. After differentiation, Pum levels diminish and Bruno (Bru) levels increase, allowing Bru to bind the same 3UTR sequence and take over translational repression of pgc mRNA. We have identified a class of maternal mRNAs regulated during oogenesis by both Pum and Bru, including Zelda, activator of the zygotic genome, which contain this core 10-nt regulatory sequence. Our data suggests that this hand off mechanism is more generally utilized to inhibit translation of maternal mRNAs during oogenesis.","10.1016/j.celrep.2018.12.007"

To better understand the large-scale brain network mechanisms underlying this variability in mental health we examined the relationship between mental health symptoms and resting-state functional connectivity patterns in cognitive control systems. The frontoparietal cognitive control network (FPN) consists of flexible hubs that can regulate distributed systems depending on current goals, and dysfunction in the FPN has been identified in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Alterations in FPN connectivity may influence mental health by disrupting the ability to regulate symptoms in a goal-directed manner. This suggests that the FPN may play an important role in the promotion and maintenance of mental health generally. Here we test the hypothesis that disruptions in FPN connectivity are related to mental health (depression) symptoms even among healthy individuals. This hypothesis is consistent with a general role of FPN in the regulation of mental health symptoms. We found that depression symptoms were negatively correlated with between-network global connectivity (BGC) of the FPN as well as the default mode network (DMN). This suggests that decreased connectivity between the FPN (and, separately, DMN) and the rest of the brain is related to increased depression symptoms among undiagnosed individuals.

We studied neurosurgical patients who performed spatial-navigation and verbal-episodic memory tasks while brain stimulation was applied in various regions during learning. During the verbal memory task, stimulation in the MTL disrupted the temporal organization of encoded memories such that items learned with stimulation tended to be recalled in a more randomized order.

Traditionally, count-based data from structured surveys have been the main source of information used to estimate trends and changes in populations. In the past decade, advances in integrated population models (IPMs) have allowed these data to be combined with other data sources (e.g., observations of marked individuals). IPMs have allowed researchers to determine the direction and magnitude of a species population trajectory and to test underlying mechanisms. For many species, life-history characteristics (e.g., low site-fidelity), low abundance and/or low detection probability make it difficult to collect sufficient data; thus, IPMs for these species are difficult to employ. We used count data from eBird to estimate population trends for one such species, the tricolored blackbird (Agelaius tricolor). We combined estimates of relative abundance with banding and nesting data. Our joint estimation of demographic rates allowed us to evaluate their individual contributions to the population growth rate. We suggest that investments in increasing reproductive success and recruitment are the most likely conservation strategies to increase the population. The extensive survey efforts of citizen scientists aided the employment of IPMs to inform conservation efforts.\n\nData AccessibilityShould the manuscript be accepted, the data supporting the results will be published along with the manuscript.

While we do not know which experimental treatments produce cells that look alike, we do know that cells exposed to the same experimental treatment should generally look similar. Thus, we explore training CNNs using a weakly supervised approach that uses this information for feature learning. In addition, the training stage is regularized to control for unwanted variations using mixup or RNNs.

We investigated this question with experimental families produced from wild-caught brown trout (Salmo trutta). Singly raised embryos were either exposed to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas fluorescens or sham-treated at one of two stages during their development. A previous study on these experimental families reported positive effects of egg carotenoids on embryo growth and resistance against the infection. Here, we quantified carotenoid consumption in these infected and sham-infected maternal sib groups. We found that carotenoid contents mostly decreased during embryogenesis. However, these decreases were neither linked to the virulence induced by the pathogen nor dependent on the time point of infection.

We asked whether heterozygotes with high TAS2R38 mRNA expression in taste tissue were also likely to express more TAS2R38 mRNA in sinonasal tissue. To that end, we measured TAS2R38 bitter taste receptor mRNA by qPCR in biopsied tissue, and learned that expression amount of one is not related to the other.

However, this structure is complex since the hippocampus is divided into several heterogeneous subfields not equally impacted by AD. Former in-vivo imaging studies only investigated structural alterations of these subfields using volumetric measurements and microstructural modifications with mean diffusivity measurements. The aim of our work is to study the efficiency of hippocampal subfields compared to the whole hippocampus structure with a multimodal patch-based framework that enables to capture subtler structural and microstructural alterations. To this end, we analyze the significance of the different hippocampal subfields for AD diagnosis and prognosis with volumetric, diffusivity measurements and a novel multimodal patch-based grading framework that combines structural and diffusion MRI.

Accurate viability assessment prior to transplantation could minimize organ discard. Rapid and accurate evaluation of intra-operative donor kidney biopsies is essential for determining which kidneys are eligible for transplantation. The criteria for accepting or rejecting donor kidneys relies heavily on pathologist determination of the percent of glomeruli (determined from a frozen section) that are normal and sclerotic. This percentage is a critical measurement that correlates with transplant outcome. Inter- and intra-observer variability in donor biopsy evaluation is, however, significant. An automated method for determination of percent global glomerulosclerosis could prove useful in decreasing evaluation variability, increasing throughput, and easing the burden on pathologists. Here, we describe the development of a deep learning model that identifies and classifies non-sclerosed and sclerosed glomeruli in whole-slide images of donor kidney frozen section biopsies. This model extends a convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on a large database of digital images. The extended model, when trained on just 48 whole slide images, exhibits slide-level evaluation performance on par with expert renal pathologists. The model substantially outperforms a model trained on image patches of isolated glomeruli. Encouragingly, the models performance is robust to slide preparation artifacts associated with frozen section preparation. As the first model reported that identifies and classifies normal and sclerotic glomeruli in frozen kidney sections, and thus the first model reported in the literature relevant to kidney transplantation, it may become an essential part of donor kidney biopsy evaluation in the clinical setting.","10.1109/TMI.2018.2851150"

For example, in budding yeast, the rate of cell growth is proportional to nutrient availability, cell size is proportional to growth rate, and growth rate is proportional to cell size. Thus, cells grow slowly in poor nutrients and are nearly half the size of cells growing in rich nutrients. Moreover, large cells grow faster than small cells. A signaling network that surrounds Tor kinase complex 2 (TORC2) plays an important role in enforcing these proportional relationships. Cells that lack components of the TORC2 network fail to modulate their growth rate or size in response to changes in nutrient availability. Here, we show that budding yeast homologs of the Lkb1 tumor suppressor kinase are required for normal modulation of TORC2 signaling and in response to changes in carbon source. Lkb1 kinases activate Snf1/AMPK to initiate transcription of genes required for utilization of poor carbon sources. However, Lkb1 influences TORC2 signaling via a novel pathway that is independent of Snf1/AMPK. Of the three Lkb1 homologs in budding yeast, Elm1 plays the most important role in modulating TORC2. Elm1 activates a pair of related kinases called Gin4 and Hsl1. Previous work found that loss of Gin4 and Hsl1 causes cells to undergo unrestrained growth during a prolonged mitotic arrest, which suggests that play a role in linking cell cycle progression to cell growth. We found that Gin4 and Hsl1 also control the TORC2 network. In addition, Gin4 and Hsl1 are themselves influenced by signals from the TORC2 network, consistent with previous work showing that the TORC2 network constitutes a feedback loop. Together, the data suggest a model in which the TORC2 network sets growth rate in response to carbon source, while also relaying signals via Gin4 and Hsl1 that set the critical amount of growth required for cell cycle progression. This kind of close linkage between control of cell growth and size would suggest a simple mechanistic explanation for the proportional relationship between cell size and growth rate.","10.1534/genetics.118.301296"

We show for the first time that males of the African cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis perceive female sex pheromone and volatiles of its plant host cotton as a unit, rather than as independent messages. In clean air, S. littoralis males are attracted to flawed pheromone signals, such as single synthetic pheromone components or even the pheromone of a sibling species, Oriental leafworm S. litura. Presence of host plant volatiles, however, strongly reduces the male response to deficient or heterospecific pheromone signals. That plant cues enhance discrimination of sex pheromone quality confirms the idea that specific mate recognition in noctuid moths has evolved in concert with host plant adaptation. A participation of host plant odour in sexual communication suggests that mate recognition is under natural and sexual selection. Moreover, shifts in either female host preference or sex pheromone biosynthesis give rise to new communication channels that have the potential to initiate or contribute to reproductive isolation.","10.1111/evo.13571"

While previous studies have linked effective communication to enhanced interareal coherence, it remains unclear, whether this interareal coherence occurs at an optimal phase relation that actually improves the stimulus transmission to behavioral report. We recorded local field potentials simultaneously from areas V1 and V4 of macaque monkeys performing a selective visual attention task, during which they reported changes of the attended stimulus. Gamma synchronization between V1 and V4, immediately preceding the stimulus change, predicted subsequent reaction times (RTs). Crucially, RTs were systematically slowed as trial-by-trial interareal gamma phase relations deviated from the phase relation at which V1 and V4 synchronized on average. These effects were specific to the attended stimulus and not due to local power or phase inside V1 or V4.

We developed a bird migration forecast system with continental scope by leveraging 23 years of spring observations to learn associations between atmospheric conditions and bird migration intensity. Our models explained up to 81% of variation in migration intensity across the United States at altitudes of 0-3000 m, and performance remained high when forecasting events 24-72 h into the future (68-72% variation explained). We infer that avian migratory movements across the United States frequently exceed 200 million individuals per night and exceed 500 million individuals per night during peak passage. Accurately forecasting bird migration will allow stakeholders to reduce collisions with illuminated buildings, airplanes, and wind turbines, predict movements under climate change scenarios, and engage the public.","10.1126/science.aat7526"

Associations can be based on relationships between object features (e.g., the three-leaflets of poison ivy leaves) and outcomes (e.g., rash). More often, outcomes are linked to multidimensional states (e.g., poison ivy is green in summer but red in spring). Feature-based reinforcement learning fails when the values of individual features depend on the other features present. One solution is to assign value to multifeatural conjunctive representations. We tested if the hippocampus formed separable conjunctive representations that enabled learning of response contingencies for stimuli of the form: AB+, B-, AC-, C+. Pattern analyses on functional MRI data showed the hippocampus formed conjunctive representations that were dissociable from feature components and that these representations influenced striatal PEs. Our results establish a novel role for hippocampal pattern separation and conjunctive representation in reinforcement learning.","10.1038/s41467-019-08998-1"

Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of research using animal models of CIPN to inform robust experimental design.\n\nMethodsWe systematically searched 5 online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Citation Index, Biosis Previews and Embase (September 2012) to identify publications reporting in vivo CIPN modelling. Due to the number of publications and high accrual rate of new studies, we ran an updated search November 2015, using machine-learning and text mining to identify relevant studies.\n\nAll data were abstracted by two independent reviewers. For each comparison we calculated a standardised mean difference effect size then combined effects in a random effects meta- analysis. The impact of study design factors and reporting of measures to reduce the risk of bias was assessed. We ran power analysis for the most commonly reported behavioural tests.\n\nResults341 publications were included. The majority (84%) of studies reported using male animals to model CIPN; the most commonly reported strain was Sprague Dawley rat. In modelling experiments, Vincristine was associated with the greatest increase in pain-related behaviour (-3.22 SD [-3.88; -2.56], n=152, p=0). The most commonly reported outcome measure was evoked limb withdrawal to mechanical monofilaments. Pain-related complex behaviours were rarely reported. The number of animals required to obtain 80% power with a significance level of 0.05 varied substantially across behavioural tests. Overall, studies were at moderate risk of bias, with modest reporting of measures to reduce the risk of bias.\n\nConclusionsHere we provide a comprehensive summary of the field of animal models of CIPN and inform robust experimental design by highlighting measures to increase the internal and external validity of studies using animal models of CIPN. Power calculations and other factors, such as clinical relevance, should inform the choice of outcome measure in study design.","10.1371/journal.pbio.3000243"

One of the current focuses in space exploration is to send humans to Mars. However, the challenge of transporting materials to Mars and the need for waste management processes are two major obstacles for these long-duration missions.\n\nTo address these two challenges a process called Astroplastic was developed that produces polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from solid human waste, which can be used to 3D print useful items for astronauts. PHB granules are naturally produced by bacteria such as Ralstonia eutropha and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for carbon and energy storage. The phaJ, phaC, and phaCBA genes were cloned from these native PHB-producing bacteria into Escherichia coli. These genes code for enzymes that aid in PHB production by converting products of glycolysis and {beta}-oxidation pathways, such as acetyl-CoA and enoyl-CoA, into PHB. To ensure a continuous PHB production system and to eliminate the need for cell lysis to extract PHB, recombinant E. coli was engineered to use the genes in its natural type I secretion system to secrete PHB. The C-terminal of the HlyA secretion tag was fused to phasin (PhaP), a protein originally from R. eutropha. Phasin-HlyA electrostatically binds PHB granules and transports them outside of the cell.\n\nIn addition to genetically engineering bacteria, a concept for start-to-finish PHB production process was designed. Integrating expert feedback and experimental results, conditions for each step of the process including the collection and storage of waste, volatile fatty acid (VFA) fermentation, VFA extraction, PHB fermentation, and PHB extraction were optimized. The optimized system will provide a sustainable and continuous PHB production system, which will address the problems of transportation costs and waste management for future space missions.\n\nFinancial DisclosureMindfuel Science Alberta Foundation Genome Alberta GenScript Polyferm Canada GeekStarter Alberta Integrated DNA Technologies University of Calgary University of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine University of Calgary Bachelor of Sciences University of Calgary Schulich School of Engineering University of Calgary OBrien Centre for the Bachelor of Health Sciences City of Calgary Alberta Innovates The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\n\nCompeting InterestsThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\nEthics StatementN/A\n\nData AvailabilityAll data are freely available without restriction.","NA"

In addition, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a frequent co-morbidity of Cr transporter (Crt) deficiency, the leading cause of CCDS. While the effects of the loss of Cr in the whole brain is clear, it is unknown if Cr is required for the proper function of all neurons. Of particular interest are dopaminergic neurons, as many CCDS patients have ADHD and Cr has been implicated in dopamine-associated neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinsons and Huntingtons diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a loss of the Slc6a8 (Cr transporter; Crt) gene in cells expressing the dopamine transporter (Slc6a3; DAT) on activity levels and motor function as the animals age. DAT-specific Crt-knockout (DAT-Crt) mice were tested along with control (Crt-FLOX) mice monthly from 3 to 12 months of age in locomotor activity, the challenging beam test, and spontaneous activity. DAT-Crt mice were hyperactive compared with controls and this finding persisted throughout the lifetime of the mice. No changes were observed in errors to cross a narrow bridge in the challenging beam test. In a measurement of spontaneous activity, DAT-Crt mice showed increased rearing and hind limb steps, suggesting the hyperactivity carried over to this task. Taken together, these data suggest that the lack of Cr in dopaminergic neurons causes hyperactivity while sparing motor function.\n\nAbbreviations","NA"

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. faecalis strains have emerged that are replete with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Some E. faecalis strains possesses CRISPR-Cas systems, which reduce the conjugation frequency of pheromone-responsive plasmids. However, many transconjugants still arise, and we have demonstrated in previous studies that E. faecalis can transiently maintain both a functional CRISPR-Cas system and a CRISPR-Cas target. In this study, we used serial passage and deep sequencing to analyze CRISPR array dynamics over time in transconjugants which possess both a functional CRISPR-Cas system and a CRISPR-Cas target. In the presence of antibiotic selection for the plasmid, we found that plasmids ultimately escape CRISPR defense via the emergence of compromised CRISPR-Cas defense in host populations. As a consequence, these populations have enhanced abilities to acquire a second antibiotic resistance plasmid. In the absence of antibiotic selection, plasmids are lost from wild-type but not {Delta}cas9 host populations over time. We conclude that the adaptive immune system of E. faecalis becomes compromised under antibiotic selection for MGEs, generating populations with enhanced abilities to undergo horizontal gene transfer.\n\nImportanceEnterococcus faecalis is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and known disseminator of drug resistance among Gram-positive bacteria. One of the main means of antibiotic resistance dissemination among E. faecalis populations is mediated by plasmids. We have previously shown that strains with an active CRISPR-Cas system can reduce plasmid acquisition and thus limit the transmission of antibiotic resistance determinants. In this study, we observed subpopulations with transient co-existence of active CRISPR-Cas and a plasmid target. Through serial passage and targeted sequencing analysis on these populations, we demonstrate that antibiotic treatment plays a key role in shaping the E. faecalis genome, resulting in compromised genome defense that facilitates acquisition of other resistance plasmids. These results are significant because they show how antibiotic selection for a plasmid can alter the evolutionary trajectory of E. faecalis populations rendering them vulnerable to the acceptance of multiple resistance plasmids.","NA"

This and other work set up the expectation that over evolutionary time, head-on alleles are selected against, maximizing genome co-orientation. Our findings challenge this model. Using the well-established GC skew method, we reveal the evolutionary inversion record of all chromosomally encoded genes in multiple divergent bacterial pathogens. We find that a surprisingly large number of co-oriented genes have inverted to, and are retained in the head-on orientation. Furthermore, we find that these head-on genes, (including key antibiotic resistance and virulence genes) have higher rates of nonsynonymous mutations and are more frequently under positive selection (dN/dS>1).

Deformability is quantified by the non-commutativity of epistatic interactions, which we experimentally demonstrate in mutant strains on the path to an evolutionary innovation. Our analysis shows that the deformation of fitness landscapes by metabolic mutations rarely affects evolutionary trajectories in the short-range.

This process can explain the typical delay time seen with caspase-8 activity reporters.

Rats were trained to drink 10% alcohol in a limited access paradigm. In separate sessions, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=13). Based on training alcohol consumption levels, we classified rats using a median split as HD or LD. Then, using machine-learning, we built predictive models to classify rats as HD or LD by corticostriatal LFPs and compared the model performance from real data to the performance of models built on data permutations. Additionally, we explored the impact of NAcSh or mPFC stimulation on alcohol consumption in HD vs. LD. Corticostriatal LFPs were able predict HD vs. LD group classification with greater accuracy than expected by chance (>80% accuracy). Additionally, NAcSh stimulation significantly reduced alcohol consumption in HD, but not LD (p<0.05), while mPFC stimulation did not alter drinking behavior in either HD or LD (p>0.05). These data collectively show that the corticostriatal circuit is differentially involved in regulating alcohol intake in HD vs. LD rats, and suggests that corticostriatal activity may have the potential to predict a vulnerability to develop alcohol dependence in a clinical population.","NA"

The current literature suggests that most mRNAs are post-transcriptionally regulated in stressful conditions, we rationalized that the postmortem transcripts must contain sequence features (3 to 9 mers) that are unique from those in the rest of the transcriptome - specifically, binding sites for proteins and/or non-coding RNAs involved in regulation. Our new study identified 5117 and 2245 over-represented sequence features in the mouse and zebrafish, respectively. Some of these features were disproportionately distributed along the transcripts with high densities in the 3-UTR region of the zebrafish (0.3 mers/nt) and the ORFs of the mouse (0.6 mers/nt). Yet, the highest density (2.3 mers/nt) occurred in the ORFs of 11 mouse transcripts that lacked UTRs. Our results suggest that these transcripts might serve as  molecular sponges that sequester RNA binding proteins and/or microRNAs, increasing the stability and gene expression of other transcripts. In addition, some features were identified as binding sites for Rbfox and Hud proteins that are also involved in increasing transcript stability and gene expression. Hence, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transcripts involved in responding to extreme stress have sequence features that make them different from the rest of the transcriptome, which presumably has implications for post-transcriptional regulation in disease, starvation, and cancer.\n\nABBREVIATIONS","10.1186/s12864-018-5042-x"

Ecological theory has demonstrated that when direct, pairwise interactions among a group of species are too numerous, or too strong, then the coexistence of these species will be unstable to any slight perturbation. This instability worsens when mutualistic interactions complement competition. Here, we refine and to some extent overturn that understanding, by considering explicitly the resources that microbes consume and produce. In contrast to more complex organisms, microbial cells consume primarily abiotic resources, and mutualistic interactions are often mediated by these same abiotic resources through the mechanism of cross-feeding. Our model therefore considers the consumption and production of a set of abiotic resources by a group of microbial species. We show that if microbes consume, but do not produce resources, then any positive equilibrium will always be stable to small perturbations. We go on to show that in the presence of crossfeeding, stability is no longer guaranteed. However, stability still holds when mutualistic interations are either symmetric, or sufficiently weak.","10.1038/s41467-018-05308-z"

Due to the stochasticity of single-molecule blinking and the desire to improve SMLMs temporal resolution, algorithms capable of analyzing frames with a high density (HD) of active molecules, or molecules whose images overlap, are a prerequisite for accurate location measurements. Thus far, HD algorithms are evaluated using scalar metrics, such as root-mean-square error, that fail to quantify the structure of errors caused by the structure of the sample. Here, we show that the spatial distribution of localization errors within super-resolved images of biological structures are vectorial in nature, leading to systematic structural biases that severely degrade image resolution. We further demonstrate that the shape of the microscopes point-spread function (PSF) fundamentally affects the characteristics of imaging artifacts. We built a Robust Statistical Estimation algorithm (RoSE) to minimize these biases for arbitrary structures and PSFs. RoSE accomplishes this minimization by estimating the likelihood of blinking events to localize molecules more accurately and eliminate false localizations. Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.","10.1038/s41598-018-31366-w"

Limiting CcrM to a specific time period during the cell cycle relies on temporal control of ccrM transcription and CcrM proteolysis. We investigated how Lon, a protease from AAA+ superfamily conserved from bacteria to humans, temporally degrades CcrM to maintain differential chromosomal methylation state, thereby regulating transcription factor synthesis and enabling cell cycle progression. We demonstrate that CcrM degradation by Lon requires DNA as an adaptor for robust proteolysis. Lon, a DNA-bound protein, is constitutively active throughout the cell cycle, but allows CcrM mediated DNA methylation only when CcrM is transcribed and translated upon completion of DNA replication. An additional mechanism to limit CcrM activity to a narrow window of the cell cycle is its sequestration to the pole of the progeny stalked cell, which prevents physical contact with DNA-bound Lon. Thus, we have provided evidence for a novel mechanism for substrate selection by the Lon protease, providing robust cell cycle control mediated by DNA methylation.","NA"

Here we genotyped 1370 control-pollinated progeny trees from 128 full-sib families in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), using exome capture as a genotyping platform. We used 116,765 high quality SNPs to develop genomic prediction models for tree height and wood quality traits. We assessed the impact of different genomic prediction methods, genotype-by-environment interaction (GxE), genetic composition, size of the training and validation set, relatedness, and the number of SNPs on the accuracy and predictive ability (PA) of GS.\n\nResultsUsing G matrix slightly altered heritability estimates relative to pedigree-based method. GS accuracies were about 11-14% lower than those based on pedigree-based selection. The efficiency of GS per year varied from 1.71 to 1.78, compared to that of the pedigree-based model if breeding cycle length was halved using GS. Height GS accuracy decreased more than 30% using one site as training for GS prediction to the second site, indicating that GxE for tree height should be accommodated in model fitting. Using half-sib family structure instead of full-sib led a significant reduction in GS accuracy and PA. The full-sib family structure only needed 750 makers to reach similar accuracy and PA as 100,000 markers required for half-sib family, indicating that maintaining the high relatedness in the model improves accuracy and PA. Using 4000-8000 markers in full-sib family structure was sufficient to obtain GS model accuracy and PA for tree height and wood quality traits, almost equivalent to that obtained with all makers.\n\nConclusionsThe study indicates GS would be efficient in reducing generation time of a breeding cycle in conifer tree breeding program that requires a long-term progeny testing. Sufficient number of trees within-family (16 for growth and 12 for wood quality traits) and number of SNPs (8000) are required for GS with full-sib family relationship. GS methods had little impact on GS efficiency for growth and wood quality traits. GS model should incorporate G x E effect when a strong GxE is detected.","10.1186/s12864-018-5256-y"

The presence of this general class of behavior is extremely widespread, even though the olfactory sensory apparatus and strategies used may vary between animals. The strategies and cues used by mammals to localize and track odor sources have recently become of interest to neuroscientists, but are still poorly understand. In order to study how mice localize odors, we trained mice to perform a trail following task using a novel behavioral paradigm and behavioral monitoring setup. We find that mice, in order to follow an odor trail, use both sniff by sniff odor concentration comparisons and internares comparisons to guide their behavior. Furthermore, they employ olfactory information to guide adaptive behaviors with remarkably short latencies of approximately 80ms. This study and its findings establish a rich, quantifiable olfactory localization behavior in mice that is amenable to physiological investigations and motivates investigation into the neural substrates of the identified olfactory cues.\n\nSignificanceMany animals, like rodents, rely heavily on their sense smell to guide them as they navigate their environment, to find food and mates and to avoid predators. Yet, in mammals, this function of the olfactory system is much less well studied than odor identification. We created a behavioral task where mice had to follow odor trails in order to efficiently find food and then tracked their movements around those trails. We found that they respond to sniff-by-sniff changes in odor intensity, using those changes to guide movements in less than one tenth of a second and also confirm that they use stereo cues to guide behavior. These results lay the groundwork for determining the brain circuits underlying olfactory navigation.","NA"

Somatic evolution drives cancer progression and treatment resistance. This process is fuelled not only by genetic and epigenetic mutation, but by selection resulting from the interactions between tumour cells, normal cells and physical microenvironment. The ecological habitat tumour cells inhabit influences evolutionary dynamics but impact on tempo of evolution is less clear.

MethodsWe explored this complex dialogue with a combined clinical-theoretical approach. Using an agent-based-model, we simulated proliferative hierarchy under heterogeneous oxygen availability. Predictions were compared against clinical data derived from histology samples taken from glioblastoma patients, stained to elucidate areas of hypoxia / necrosis, and p53 expression heterogeneity.

ResultsSimulation results indicate cell division in hypoxic environments is effectively upregulated, and that low-oxygen niches provide new avenues for tumour cells to spread. Analysis of human data indicates cell division isnt decreased in low-oxygen regions, despite evidence of significant physiological stress. This is consistent with simulation, suggesting hypoxia is a crucible that effectively warping evolutionary velocity, making deleterious mutations more likely than in well-oxygenated regions.

While there is a long history of research into thought control, the inherent subjectivity of thoughts has made objective investigation, and thus mechanistic understanding difficult. Here, we report a novel method to empirically investigate thought control success and failure by objectively measuring the sensory strength of visual thoughts. We use the perceptual illusion binocular rivalry to assess emergent images in mind during two common thought control strategies: thought suppression and thought substitution. Thought suppression was ineffective, suppressed thoughts primed subsequent rivalry dominance at the same level as intentionally imagined thoughts. This priming effect was disrupted by concurrent uniform luminance and changes in retinotopic location, suggesting early visual representations/traces. While individuals showed some metacognition of thought suppression, strikingly, the perceptual effects remained even when thoughts were reported as successfully suppressed, indicating these thoughts may exist outside of reportable awareness. In contrast, thought substitution was more effective in controlling the perceptual effects and showed good metacognition. A thought control index predicted greater levels of trait mindfulness, while high levels of anxiety and schizotypy were related to poor thought control. Overall, our findings offer a novel method to track thoughts before and after they emerge into awareness and suggest that non-reportable and involuntary thoughts form visual representations pivotal to thought control failure.","NA"

To investigate these questions, we analyzed the pattern of RT during a set of multi-dimensional learning and decision-making tasks that can prompt subjects to adopt different learning strategies. In our experiments, subjects could use reward feedback to directly learn reward values associated with possible choice options (object-based learning). Alternatively, they could learn reward values of options features (e.g. color, shape) and combine these values to estimate reward values for individual options (feature-based learning). We found that RT was slower when the difference between subjects estimates of reward probabilities for the two alternative objects on a given trial was smaller. Moreover, RT was overall faster when the preceding trial was rewarded or when the previously selected object was present. These effects, however, were mediated by an interaction between these factors such that subjects were faster when the previously selected object was present rather than absent but only after unrewarded trials. Finally, RT reflected the learning strategy (i.e. object-based or feature-based approach) adopted by the subject on a trial-by-trial basis, indicating an overall faster construction of reward value and/or value comparison during object-based learning.

LIFFT implements a Bayesian framework that takes into account data at all measured residues and enables visual assessment of modeling uncertainties that can be overlooked in least-squares fits. The framework is appropriate for multimodal techniques ranging from chemical mapping including multi-wavelength spectroscopy.\n\nAvailabilityFreely available MATLAB package at https://ribokit.stanford.edu/LIFFT/.\n\nContactrhiju@stanford.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","NA"

In this paper we present an accurate and robust analytic algorithm suitable for a large-scale SES analysis. The accuracy and robustness of our algorithm are made possible by an iterative strategy for the treatments of probe-probe intersections, probe-probe overlaps and limited numerical precision. The accuracy and robustness of our algorithm in turn make it possible to analyze on a large-scale the SESs for different types of proteins and various sets of ligand-protein interaction interfaces. The results illustrate the usefulness of SES and SES-defined physical and geometrical properties for the characterization of protein-solvent interaction and ligand-protein interaction where ligand could be either small molecule compound, or membrane lipid, or DNA or protein.","NA"

Presently, third generation sequencing platforms able to generate much longer reads are becoming more widespread. These platforms come with the significant drawback of higher sequencing error rates, which makes them ill-suited to current genotyping algorithms. However, the longer reads make more of the genome unambiguously mappable and typically provide linkage information between neighboring variants.\n\nResultsIn this paper we introduce a novel approach for haplotype-aware genotyping from noisy long reads. We do this by considering bipartitions of the sequencing reads, corresponding to the two haplotypes. We formalize the computational problem in terms of a Hidden Markov Model and compute posterior genotype probabilities using the forward-backward algorithm. Genotype predictions can then be made by picking the most likely genotype at each site. Our experiments indicate that longer reads allow significantly more of the genome to potentially be accurately genotyped. Further, we are able to use both Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences sequencing data to independently validate millions of variants previously identified by short-read technologies in the reference NA12878 sample, including hundreds of thousands of variants that were not previously included in the high-confidence reference set.","NA"

However, the cellular contributors and ways in which cells interact inside tissues to enable coordinated isotropic tissue scaling are not yet understood. Here, we follow cell and tissue shape changes in the zebrafish retinal neuroepithelium, which forms a cup with a smooth surface early in development and maintains this architecture as it grows. By combining 3D analysis and theory, we show that a global increase in cell height is necessary to maintain this tissue shape during growth. Timely cell height increase is governed by non-cell autonomous actin redistribution. Blocking actin redistribution and cell height increase perturbs isotropic scaling and leads to disturbed, folded tissue shape. Taken together, our data show how global changes in cell shape enable isotropic growth of the developing retinal neuroepithelium, a concept that could also apply to other systems.","10.1371/journal.pbio.2006018"

There is much evidence that the probability of host-shifts decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance between donor and recipient hosts, but the consequences of such preferential host switching remain little explored. We develop a mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of parasite host-shifts in the presence of this phylogenetic distance effect. Host trees evolve under a stochastic birth-death process and parasites co-evolve concurrently on those trees, undergoing host-shifts, co-speciation and extinction. Our model indicates that host trees have a major influence on these dynamics. This applies both to individual trees that evolved under the same stochastic process and to sets of trees that evolved with different macroevolutionary parameters. We predict that trees consisting of a few large clades of host species and those with fast species turnover should harbour more parasites than trees with many small clades and those that diversify more slowly. Within trees, large clades should exhibit a higher infection frequency than small clades. We discuss our results in the light of recent cophylogenetic studies in a wide range of host-parasite systems, including the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia.","10.1111/evo.13716"

Here, we describe for the first time an ancient and diverging lineage of the Italian wall lizard Podarcis siculus from the western Pontine Islands. We used nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences of 156 individuals with the aim of unraveling their phylogenetic position, while microsatellite loci were used to compare several a priori insular biogeographic models of migration with empirical data. Our results suggest that the western Pontine populations colonized the islands early during their Pliocene volcanic formation, while populations from the eastern Pontine Islands seem to have been introduced recently. The inter-island genetic makeup indicates an important role of historical migration, probably due to glacial land bridges connecting islands followed by a recent vicariant mechanism of isolation. Moreover, the most supported migration model predicted higher gene flow among islands sharing a longitudinal arrangement. Considering the threatened status of small insular endemic populations, we suggest this new evolutionarily independent unit be given priority in conservation efforts.","NA"

Brainard","University of Pennsylvania","2018-04-03",1,"15","new results","neuroscience","The way that humans and animals perceive the lightness of an object depends on its physical luminance as well as its surrounding context. While neuronal responses throughout the visual pathway are modulated by context, the relationship between neuronal responses and lightness perception is poorly understood. We searched for a neuronal mechanism of lightness by recording responses of neuronal populations in monkey primary visual cortex (V1) and area V4 to stimuli that produce a lightness illusion in humans, in which the lightness of a disk depends on the context in which it is embedded. We found that the way individual units encode the luminance (or equivalently for our stimuli, contrast) of the disk and its context is extremely heterogeneous. This motivated us to ask whether the population representation in either V1 or V4 satisfies three criteria: 1) disk luminance is represented with high fidelity, 2) the context surrounding the disk is also represented, and 3) the representations of disk luminance and context interact to create a representation of lightness that depends on these factors in a manner consistent with human psychophysical judgments of disk lightness. We found that populations of units in both V1 and V4 fulfill the first two criteria, but that we cannot conclude that the two types of information in either area interact in a manner that clearly predicts human psychophysical measurements: the interpretation of our population measurements depends on how subsequent areas read out lightness from the population responses.\n\nNew & NoteworthyA core question in visual neuroscience is how the brain extracts stable representations of object properties from the retinal image. We searched for a neuronal mechanism of lightness perception by determining whether the responses of neuronal populations in primary visual cortex and area V4 could account for a lightness illusion measured using human psychophysics. Our results suggest that comparing psychophysics with population recordings will yield insight into neuronal mechanisms underlying a variety of perceptual phenomena.","10.1152/jn.00906.2017"

We studied a group of patients with strokes in the left frontoparietal cortices. We found that they were equally impaired at imitating movement trajectories using the ipsilesional limb (i.e., the non-paretic side) that were cued either by an actor using their whole arm or just by a cursor, suggesting that body configuration is not always critical for imitation and that a representation of abstract trajectory shape may suffice.

Second, the cell-to-cell variability is high, with a low proportion of cells expressing the same gene at the same time/level. Those emerging patterns appear to be very challenging from the statistical point of view, especially to represent and to provide a summarized view of single-cell expression data. PCA is one of the most powerful frameworks to provide a suitable representation of high dimensional datasets, by searching for new axes catching the most variability in the data. Unfortunately, classical PCA is based on Euclidean distances and projections that work poorly in presence of over-dispersed counts showing zero-inflation. We propose a probabilistic Count Matrix Factorization (pCMF) approach for single-cell expression data analysis, that relies on a sparse Gamma-Poisson factor model. This hierarchical model is inferred using a variational EM algorithm. We show how this probabilistic framework induces a geometry that is suitable for single-cell data, and produces a compression of the data that is very powerful for clustering purposes.

Here we present a model of Hsp70-mediated protein folding, which predicts that Hsp70, as a result of differential stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by its Hsp40 cochaperone, dissociates faster from a substrate in fold-competent conformations than from one in misfolding-prone conformations, thus elevating the native concentration above and suppressing the misfolded concentration below their respective equilibrium values. Previous models would not make or imply these predictions, which are experimentally testable.

Vesicles become attached to the membrane via the SNARE complex. The SNARE complex comprises the vesicle associate protein Synaptobrevin (Syb), the membrane associated protein syntaxin (Syx), and the cytosolic protein SNAP25, which together form a four-helical bundle. The full assembly of Syb onto the core SNARE bundle promotes vesicle fusion. We investigated SNARE assembly using a coarse-grained model of the SNARE complex. The model retains chemical specificity, and was calibrated using single molecule experiments and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Steered force-control simulations of SNARE unzippering by peeling off Syb were used to set up initial disassembled states of the SNARE complex. From these states, the assembly process was simulated. We found that if Syb is in helical form, then the SNARE complex assembles rapidly, on a sub-microsecond time-scale. We found that assembly times grow exponentially with separation distance between Syb and Syx C-termni. The formation of helical turns is likely to substantially decelerate the assembly, consistent with single molecule force experiments that show SNARE assembly duration on the time-scale of hundreds of ms. Since synaptic vesicle fusion occurs at a sub-millisecond time-scale, our results indicate that for biologically relevant rapid assembly the SNARE complex needs to be partially zippered and its constituent helices brought into proximity, possibly by means of molecular chaperones.","NA"

The relationship between DNAm scores and all-cause mortality (n = 214 events) was assessed via Cox proportional-hazards models.\n\nResultsThe DNAm-based predictors explained different proportions of the phenotypic variance for BMI (12%), smoking (60%), alcohol consumption (12%) and education (3%). The combined genetic and DNAm predictors explained 20% of the variance in BMI, 61% in smoking, 13% in alcohol consumption, and 6% in education. DNAm predictors for smoking, alcohol, and education but not BMI predicted mortality in univariate models. The predictors showed moderate discrimination of obesity (AUC=0.67) and alcohol consumption (AUC=0.75), and excellent discrimination of current smoking status (AUC=0.98). There was poorer discrimination of college-educated individuals (AUC=0.59).\n\nConclusionsDNAm predictors correlate with lifestyle factors that are associated with health and mortality. They may supplement DNAm-based predictors of age to identify the lifestyle profiles of individuals and predict disease risk.\n\nList of abbreviations","10.1186/s13059-018-1514-1"

These datasets are typically not independent from each other. For example, methylation may influence gene expression, which may, in turn, influence drug response. Such relationships can strongly affect analyses performed on the data, as we have previously shown for the identification of biomarkers of drug response. Therefore, it is important to be able to chart the relationships between datasets.\n\nResultsWe present iTOP, a methodology to infera topology of relationships between datasets. We base this methodology on the RV coefficient, a measure of matrix correlation, which can be used to determine how much information is shared between two datasets. We extended the RV coefficient for partial matrix correlations, which allows the use of graph reconstruction algorithms, such as the PC algorithm, to infer the topologies. In addition, since multi-omics data often contain binary data (e.g. mutations), we also extended the RV coefficient for binary data. Applying iTOP to pharmacogenomics data, we found that gene expression acts as a mediator between most other datasets and drug response: only proteomics clearly shares information with drug response that is not present in gene expression. Based on this result, we used TANDEM, a method for drug response prediction, to identify which variables predictive of drug response were distinct to either gene expression or proteomics.\n\nAvailabilityAn implementation of our methodology is available in the R package iTOP on CRAN.

It is thought that the high fidelity segmented genome assembly involves multiple sequence-specific RNA-RNA interactions between single-stranded RNA segment precursors. These are mediated by virus-encoded non-structural proteins with RNA chaperone-like activities, such as rotavirus NSP2 and avian reovirus {sigma}NS. Here, we compared the abilities of NSP2 and {sigma}NS to mediate sequence-specific interactions between rotavirus genomic segment precursors. Despite their similar activities, NSP2 successfully promotes inter-segment association, while {sigma}NS fails to do so. To understand the mechanisms underlying such selectivity in promoting inter-molecular duplex formation, we compared RNA-binding and helix-unwinding activities of both proteins. We demonstrate that octameric NSP2 binds structured RNAs with high affinity, resulting in efficient intramolecular RNA helix disruption. Hexameric {sigma}NS oligomerises into an octamer that binds two RNAs, yet it exhibits only limited RNA-unwinding activity compared to NSP2. Thus, the formation of intersegment RNA-RNA interactions is governed by both helix-unwinding capacity of the chaperones and stability of RNA structure. We propose that this protein-mediated RNA selection mechanism may underpin the high fidelity assembly of multi-segmented RNA genomes in Reoviridae.","10.1093/nar/gky394"

Proteins in these droplets often contain RNA-binding domains, but the effects of RNA on LLPS have been controversial. To gain better understanding on the roles of RNA, here we used Gibbs-ensemble simulations to determine phase diagrams of two-component patchy particles, as models for mixtures of proteins with RNA or other regulatory components. Protein-like particles have four patches, with attraction strength{varepsilon} PP; regulatory particles experience mutual steric repulsion but have two attractive patches toward proteins, with the strength{varepsilon} PR tunable. At low{varepsilon} PR, the regulator, due to steric repulsion, preferentially partitions in the dispersed phase, thereby displacing the protein into the droplet phase and promoting LLPS. At moderate{varepsilon} PR, the regulator starts to partition and displace the protein in the droplet phase, but only to weaken bonding networks and thereby suppress LLPS. At{varepsilon} PR >{varepsilon} PP, the enhanced bonding ability of the regulator initially promotes LLPS, but at higher amounts, the resulting displacement of the protein suppresses LLPS. These results illustrate how RNA can have disparate effects on LLPS, thus able to perform diverse functions in different organelles.","10.1038/s41598-018-25132-1"

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the response to chemotherapy of BRCA-deficient tumors is paramount for developing improved personalized cancer therapies. While PARP inhibitors have been recently approved for treatment of BRCA-mutant breast and ovarian cancers, resistance to these novel drugs remains a major clinical problem. Several mechanisms of chemoresistance in BRCA2-deficient cells have been identified. Rather than restoring normal recombination, these mechanisms result in stabilization of stalled replication forks, which normally are subjected to degradation in BRCA2-mutated cells. Here, we show that the transcriptional repressor E2F7 controls chemoresistance in BRCA2-deficient cells. We found that E2F7 depletion restores PARP inhibitor and cisplatin resistance in BRCA2-depleted cells. Moreover, we show that the mechanism underlying this activity involves increased expression of RAD51, a target for E2F7-mediated transcriptional repression, which enhances both Homologous Recombination DNA repair, and replication fork stability in BRCA2-deficient cells. Our work describes a new mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in BRCA2-deficient cells, and identifies E2F7 as a novel biomarker for tumor response to PARP inhibitor therapy.","10.1093/nar/gky657"

Applied to single cell ATAC-seq, BROCKMAN readily distinguished cell types, treatments, batch effects, experimental artifacts, and cycling cells. We show that each variable component in the k-mer landscape reflects a set of co-varying TFs, which are often known to physically interact. For example, in K562 cells, AP-1 TFs were central determinant of variability in chromatin accessibility through their variable expression levels and diverse interactions with other TFs.

However, several acylsugar metabolic genes remain unidentified, and little is known about regulation of this pathway. We used comparative transcriptomic analysis between low- and high-acylsugar-producing accessions of Solanum pennellii and found that expression levels of most acylsugar metabolic genes, including known acylsucrose biosynthetic genes and novel candidate genes (putatively encoding a ketoacyl-ACP synthase IV/II-like enzyme, peroxisomal acyl-activating enzymes, ABC transporters, and central carbon metabolic enzymes), were positively correlated with acylsugar accumulation, except two acylglucose biosynthetic genes. Genes putatively encoding oxylipin metabolic proteins, subtilisin-like proteases, and other antimicrobial defense proteins were upregulated in low-acylsugar-producing accessions, possibly to compensate for diminished defense activities of acylsugars. Gene co-expression network analysis clustered most differentially expressed genes into two separate modules and identified genetic networks associated with acylsugar production and plant defense. Transcriptome analysis after inhibition of biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids (precursors to branched-chain fatty acids) further supported the coordinated regulation of most acylsugar candidate genes and identified three putative AP2-family transcription factor genes that form a strong co-expression network with many acylsugar metabolic genes.","10.1105/tpc.19.00552"

However none of them provide much detail about PPI and a single model that reconciles them remains elusive.

In such networks, ensembles of neurons, rather than single units with easily interpretable tuning properties, encode behaviourally relevant variables. Here we show that this is the case also in the dentate gyrus and CA1 subregions of the hippocampus. Using calcium imaging in freely moving mice, we decoded the instantaneous position, direction of motion and speed from the activity of hundreds of cells in the hippocampus of mice freely exploring an arena. For the vast majority of neurons in both regions, their response properties were not predictive of their importance for encoding position. Furthermore, we could decode position from populations of cells that were important for decoding direction of motion and vice versa, showing that these quantities are encoded by largely overlapping ensembles as in distributed neural code. Finally, we found that correlated activities had an impact on decoding performance in CA1 but not in dentate gyrus, suggesting different enconding strategies for these areas.

Such studies have demonstrated that faces can be detected within natural scenes within as little as 100ms (Crouzet, Kirchner & Thorpe, 2010), while increasingly complex decisions require longer processing times (Besson, Barragan-Jason, Thorpe, Fabre-Thorpe, Puma et al., 2017). Following the notion that facial representations stored in memory facilitate perceptual processing (Ramon & Gobbini, 2018), a recent study reported 180ms as the fastest speed at which \""familiar face detection\"" based on expressed choice saccades (Visconti di Ollegio Castello & Gobbini, 2015).

Here, we reason that this apparent discrepancy could be accounted for in terms of decisional space constraints, which modulate both manual RTs observed for different levels of visual processing (Besson et al., 2017), as well as saccadic RTs (SRTs) in both healthy observers and neurological patients (Ramon, in press; Ramon, Sokhn, Lao & Caldara, in press). In the present study, over 70 observers completed three different SRT experiments in which decisional space was manipulated through task demands and stimulus probability. Subjects performed a gender categorization task, or one of two familiar face \""recognition\"" tasks, which differed with respect to the number of personally familiar identities presented (3 vs. 7). We observe an inverse relationship between visual categorization proficiency and decisional space. Observers were most accurate for categorization of gender, which could be achieved in as little as 140ms. Categorization of highly predictable targets was more error-prone and required an additional ~100ms processing time. Our findings add to increasing evidence that pre-activation of identity-information can modulate early visual processing in a top-down manner.

To escape eradication by these antiviral drugs, or by the host immune system, HIV-1 exploits poorly defined host factors that silence provirus transcription. These same factors, though, must be overcome by all retroviruses, including HIV-1 and other primate immunodeficiency viruses, in order to activate provirus transcription and produce new virus. Here we show that Vpx and Vpr, proteins from a wide range of primate immunodeficiency viruses, activate provirus transcription in human CD4+ T cells. Provirus activation required the DCAF1 adaptor that links Vpx and Vpr to the CUL4A/B ubiquitin ligase complex, but did not require degradation of SAMHD1, a well-characterized target of Vpx and Vpr. A loss-of-function screen for transcription silencing factors that mimic the effect of Vpx on provirus silencing identified all components of the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex, FAM208A (TASOR/RAP140), MPHOSPH8 (MPP8), PPHLN1 (PERIPHILIN), and MORC2.

Finally, vpx and FAM208A knockdown accelerated HIV-1 and SIVMAC replication kinetics in CD4+ T cells to a similar extent, and HIV-2 replication required either vpx or FAM208A disruption. These results demonstrate that the HUSH complex restricts transcription of primate immunodeficiency viruses and thereby contributes to provirus latency. To counteract this restriction and activate provirus expression, primate immunodeficiency viruses encode Vpx and Vpr proteins that degrade HUSH complex components.","10.1038/s41564-018-0256-x"

Although Piezo1 channels diffuse readily in the plasma membrane and are widely distributed across the cell, their flicker activity is enriched in regions proximal to force-producing adhesions. The mechanical force that activates Piezo1 arises from Myosin II phosphorylation by Myosin Light Chain Kinase. We propose that Piezo1 Ca2+ flickers allow spatial segregation of mechanotransduction events, and that diffusion allows channel molecules to efficiently respond to transient, local mechanical stimuli.","10.1016/j.bpj.2018.11.2049"

Blooms of planktonic Cyanobacteria have long been of concern in lakes, but recognition of potential harmful impacts of riverine benthic cyanobacterial mats is more recent. Consequently little is known about the diversity of the biosynthetic capacities of cyanobacterial species and associated microbes in mats throughout river networks. Here we performed metagenomic sequencing for 22 Phormidium-dominated microbial mats collected across the Eel River network in Northern California to investigate cyanobacterial and co-occurring microbial assemblage diversity, probe their metabolic potential and evaluate their capacities for toxin production. We genomically defined four Cyanobacterial species clusters that occur throughout the river network, three of which have not been described previously. From the genomes of seven strains from one species group we describe the first anatoxin-a operon from the genus Phormidium. Community composition within the mat appears to be associated with the presence of Cyanobacteria capable of producing anatoxin-a. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and novel Verrucomicrobia dominated the microbial assemblages. Interestingly, some mats also contained organisms from candidate phyla such as Canditatus Kapabacteria, as well as Absconditabacteria (SR1), Parcubacteria (OD1) and Peregrinibacteria (PER) within the Candidate Phyla Radiation. Oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon respiration were the most common metabolisms detected in mats but other metabolic capacities include aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis, sulfur compound oxidation and breakdown of urea. The results reveal the diversity of metabolisms fueling the growth of mats, and a relationship between microbial assemblage composition and the distribution of anatoxin-a producing cyanobacteria within freshwater Phormidium mats in river networks.","NA"

As such, the evolutionary basis and biological features of cellular senescence remain a fascinating area of research. In this study, we conducted comparative RNAseq experiments to detect genes associated with replicative senescence in two different human cell lines and at different time points. We identified 841 and 900 genes (core senescence-associated genes) that are significantly up- and downregulated in senescent cells, respectively, in both cell lines. Our functional enrichment analysis showed that downregulated core genes are primarily involved in cell cycle processes while upregulated core gene enrichment indicated various lipid-related processes. We further demonstrated that downregulated genes are significantly more conserved than upregulated genes. Using both transcriptomics and genetic variation data, we identified one of the upregulated, lipid metabolism gene, CD36 as an outlier. We found that overexpression of CD36 induces a senescence-like phenotype and, further, the media of CD36-overexpressing cells alone can induce a senescence-like phenotype in proliferating young cells. Moreover, we used a targeted lipidomics approach and showed that phosphatidylcholines accumulate during senescence in these cells, suggesting that upregulation of CD36 could contribute to membrane remodeling during senescence. Overall, these results contribute to the understanding of evolution and biology of cellular senescence and identify several targets and questions for future studies.","10.1039/c8mo00099a"

These cells expressed CSF1R, alongside high levels of FLT3, MHCII, XCR1 and other markers associated with conventional dendritic cells (cDC) in mice.

Additionally, MHCII-expressing tumors contained more TCR clonotypes expanded to a larger degree than control tumors. Functional CD8+ T cells in tumors depended on CD4+ T cells. However, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells eventually became exhausted, even in MHCII-expressing tumors. PD1 blockade had no impact on tumor growth, potentially because tumor cells poorly expressed PD-L1.

In this work, we dissect the multiple and complex effects of UNC-6/Netrin on the growth cone. Previous studies showed that in C. elegans, the UNC-6/Netrin receptor UNC-5 regulates growth cone polarity, as evidenced by loss of asymmetric dorsal F-actin localization and protrusion in unc-5 mutants. UNC-5 and another UNC-6/Netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC also regulate the extent of protrusion, with UNC-40/DCC driving protrusion and UNC-5 inhibiting protrusion. In this work we analyze the roles of UNC-6/Netrin, UNC-40/DCC, and UNC-5 in coordinating growth cone F-actin localization, microtubule organization, and protrusion that results in directed outgrowth away from UNC-6/Netrin. We find that a previously-described pathway involving the UNC-73/Trio Rac GEF and UNC-33/CRMP that acts downstream of UNC-5, regulates growth cone dorsal asymmetric F-actin accumulation and protrusion. unc-5 and unc-33 mutants also display excess EBP-2::GFP puncta, suggesting that MT + end accumulation is important in growth cone polarity and/or protrusion. unc-73 Rac GEF mutants did not display excess EBP-2::GFP puncta despite larger and more protrusive growth cones, indicating a MT-independent mechanism to polarize the growth cone and to inhibit protrusion, possibly via actin. Finally, we show that UNC-6/Netrin and UNC-40/DCC are required for excess protrusion in unc-5 mutants, but not for loss of F-actin asymmetry or MT + end accumulation, indicating that UNC-6/Netrin and UNC-40/DCC are required for protrusion downstream of F-actin asymmetry and MT + end entry. Our data suggest a model in which UNC-6/Netrin polarizes the growth cone via UNC-5, and then regulates a balance of pro- and anti-protrusive forces driven by UNC-40 and UNC-5, respectively, that result in directed protrusion and outgrowth.","NA"

Microbiome studies may report varying results on the same topic, therefore, meta-analyses examining different microbiome studies to provide robust results are important. So far, there is still a lack of implemented methods to properly examine differential relative abundances of microbial taxonomies and to perform meta-analysis examining the heterogeneity and overall effects across microbiome studies.\n\nResultsWe developed an R package  metamicrobiomeR that applies Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) with a zero-inflated beta (BEZI) family (GAMLSS-BEZI) for analysis of microbiome relative abundance datasets. Both simulation studies and application to real microbiome data demonstrate that GAMLSS-BEZI well performs in testing differential relative abundances of microbial taxonomies. Importantly, the estimates from GAMLSS-BEZI are log(odds ratio) of relative abundances between groups and thus are comparable between microbiome studies. As such, we also apply random effects meta-analysis models to pool estimates and their standard errors across microbiome studies.

Johal","Purdue University","2018-04-04",1,"3","new results","pathology","Adult plant resistance (APR) is an enigmatic phenomenon in which resistance genes are ineffective in protecting seedlings from disease but confer robust resistance at maturity. Maize has multiple cases in which genes confer APR to northern leaf spot, a lethal disease caused by Cochliobolus carbonum race 1 (CCR1). The first identified case of APR in maize is encoded by a hypomorphic allele, Hm1A, at the hm1 locus. In contrast, wild type alleles of hm1 provide complete protection at all developmental stages and in every part of the maize plant. Hm1 encodes an NADPH-dependent reductase, which inactivates HC-toxin, a key virulence effector of CCR1. Cloning and characterization of Hm1A ruled out differential transcription or translation for its APR phenotype and identified an amino acid substitution that reduced HC-toxin reductase (HCTR) activity. The possibility of a causal relationship between the weak nature of Hm1A and its APR phenotype was confirmed by the generation of two new APR alleles of Hm1 by mutagenesis. The HCTRs encoded by these new APR alleles had undergone relatively conservative missense changes that partially reduced their enzymatic activity similar to HM1A. No difference in accumulation of HCTR was observed between adult and juvenile plants, suggesting that the susceptibility of seedlings derives from a greater need for HCTR activity, not reduced accumulation of the gene product. Conditions and treatments that altered the photosynthetic output of the host had a dramatic effect on resistance imparted by the APR alleles, demonstrating a link between the energetic or metabolic status of the host and disease resistance affected by HC-toxin catabolism by the APR alleles of HCTR.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAdult plant resistance (APR) is a phenomenon in which disease resistance genes are able to confer resistance at the adult stages of the plant but somehow fail to do so at the seedling stages. Despite the widespread occurrence of APR in various plant diseases, the mechanism underlying this trait remains obscure. It is not due to the differential transcription of these genes, and here we show that it is also not due to the differential translation or activity of the APR alleles of the maize hm1 gene at different stages of development. Using a combination of molecular genetics, biochemistry and physiology, we present multiple lines of evidence that demonstrate that APR is a feature or symptom of weak forms of resistance. While the mature parts of the plant are metabolically robust enough to manifest resistance, seedling tissues are not, leaving them vulnerable to disease. Growth conditions that compromise the photosynthetic output of the plant further deteriorate the ability of the seedlings to protect themselves from pathogens.\n\nOne sentence summaryCharacterization of adult plant resistance in the maize-CCR1 pathosystem reveals a causal link between weak resistance and APR.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007356"

To deal with these problems, we developed GET_PHYLOMARKERS, a pipeline designed to identify high-quality markers to estimate robust genome phylogenies from the orthologous clusters, or the pan-genome matrix (PGM), computed by GET_HOMOLOGUES. In the first context, a set of sequential filters are applied to exclude recombinant alignments and those producing anomalous or poorly resolved trees.

A ML species tree is estimated from the concatenated set of top-ranking alignments at the DNA or protein levels, using either FastTree or IQ-TREE (IQT). The latter is used by default due to its superior performance revealed in an extensive benchmark analysis. In addition, parsimony and ML phylogenies can be estimated from the PGM.\n\nWe demonstrate the practical utility of the software by analyzing 170 Stenotrophomonas genome sequences available in RefSeq and 10 new complete genomes of environmental S. maltophilia complex (Smc) isolates reported herein. A combination of core-genome and PGM analyses was used to revise the molecular systematics of the genus. An unsupervised learning approach that uses a goodness of clustering statistic identified 20 groups within the Smc at a core-genome average nucleotide identity of 95.9% that are perfectly consistent with strongly supported clades on the core- and pan-genome trees. In addition, we identified 14 misclassified RefSeq genome sequences, 12 of them labeled as S. maltophilia, demonstrating the broad utility of the software for phylogenomics and geno-taxonomic studies.

We previously showed that the acetylated histone H4-binding protein BET-1 maintains cell fate by recruiting the histone variant H2A.z. Here, we report that Caenorhabditis elegans tousled-like kinase TLK-1 and the histone H3 chaperone CAF1 maintain cell fate by preventing the incorporation of histone variant H3.3 into nucleosomes, thereby repressing ectopic expression of transcription factors that induce cell-fate specification. Genetic analyses suggested that TLK-1 and BET-1 act in parallel pathways. In tlk-1 mutants, the loss of SIN-3, which promotes histone acetylation, suppressed a defect in cell-fate maintenance in a manner dependent on MYST family histone acetyltransferase MYS-2 and BET-1. sin-3 mutation also suppressed abnormal H3.3 incorporation. Thus, we propose that the regulation and interaction of histone variants play crucial roles in cell-fate maintenance through the regulation of selector genes.","10.1242/bio.038448"

There are complex signal exchanges and mutual recognition between microbes and plants. In this study, phosphate-solubilizing Pseudomonas sp. P34, a PGPR strain with affinity to wheat, was isolated from the wheat rhizosphere by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). The plasmid pTR102 harboring the luciferase luxAB gene was transferred into P34 to create P34-L. The labeled strain was used to track the temporal and spatial characteristics of colonization in wheat rhizosphere and its effects on wheat development. The transcript level of phosphate transporter gene TaPT4, a phosphorus deficiency indicator gene, in wheat roots was monitored by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. The experimental results indicated that there was a high density of stain P34-L within the top 8-cm depth of the wheat rhizosphere on day 36 of wheat growth. The strain could survive in the wheat rhizosphere for a long time, and colonize new spaces in wheat rhizosphere following the extension of wheat roots. Compared with uninoculated wheat plants, those inoculated with P34-L showed significantly increased phosphorus accumulation in leaves, seedling fresh and dry weight, root fresh and dry weight, total root length, and number of root tips, forks, crossings, which showed a great value of application of the strain on wheat production by promoting the root growth and dry matter accumulation. Strain P34-L down-regulated the transcript level of TaPT4 in wheat roots, which means a well phosphorus supplementation environment was established by P34-L.\n\nImportanceMany PGPR strains often failed to achieve the desired effects when applied in the field. One major reason for the failure is lack of a special affinity between a certain strain and the target host plant, so those strains have low competitive ability with the indigenous microorganism, and unable to survive constantly in rhizosphere. In this work, a new technique to isolate wheat-specific phosphate-solubilizing PGPR strain by WGA was established. The isolate P34 was confirmed can colonize the wheat rhizosphere, and have significantly ability in promoting phosphorus absorption and wheat growth by luminescence labeling techniques. Furthermore, the phosphate-solubilizing ability of this affinity PGPR strain was verified in gene level by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. These results lay a firm foundation for further research on the relationships between PGPR and their host plants. Meanwhile, this work supplied a potential ideal biofertilizer producing strain for sustainable agriculture.","NA"

This has important consequences on the prediction of orthology relationships, since two orthologous genes separated by divergence after duplication may differ in both sequence and function. In this work, we make the distinction between the primary orthologs, which have not been affected by accelerated mutation rates on their evolutionary path, and the secondary orthologs, which have. Similarity-based prediction methods will tend to miss secondary orthologs, whereas phylogeny-based methods cannot separate primary and secondary orthologs. However, both types of orthology have applications in important areas such as gene function prediction and phylogenetic reconstruction, motivating the need for methods that can distinguish the two types.\n\nResultsWe formalize the notion of divergence after duplication, and provide a theoretical basis for the inference of primary and secondary orthologs. We then put these ideas to practice with the HyPPO (Hybrid Prediction of Paralogs and Orthologs) framework, which combines ideas from both similarity and phylogeny approaches. We apply our method to simulated and empirical datasets, and show that we achieve superior accuracy in predicting primary orthologs, secondary orthologs and paralogs.\n\nAvailabilityHyPPO is a modular framework with a core developed in Python, and is provided with a variety of C++ modules.

Evolution of foxr1 in vertebrates was examined and the gene found to exist in most vertebrates, including mammals, ray-finned fish, amphibians, and sauropsids. By quantitative PCR and RNA-seq, we found that foxr1 had an ovarian-specific expression in zebrafish, a common feature of maternal-effect genes. In addition, it was demonstrated using in situ hybridization that foxr1 was a maternally-inherited transcript that was highly expressed even in early-stage oocytes and accumulated in the developing eggs during oogenesis. We also analyzed the function of foxr1 in female reproduction using a zebrafish CRISPR/Cas9 knockout model. It was observed that embryos from the foxr1-deficient females had a significantly lower survival rate whereby they either failed to undergo cell division or underwent abnormal division that culminated in growth arrest at around the mid-blastula transition and early death. These mutant-derived eggs contained a dramatically increased level of p21, a cell cycle inhibitor, and reduced rictor, a component of mTOR and regulator of cell survival, which were in line with the observed growth arrest phenotype. Our study shows for the first time that foxr1 is an essential maternal-effect gene and is required for proper cell division and survival via the p21 and mTOR pathways. These novel findings will broaden our knowledge on the functions of specific maternal factors stored in the developing egg and the underlying mechanisms that contribute to reproductive fitness.\n\nSummary sentenceThe foxr1 gene in zebrafish is a novel maternal-effect gene that is required for proper cell division in the earliest stage of embryonic development possibly as a transcriptional factor for cell cycle progression regulators, p21 and rictor.","NA"

Despite decades of effort interrogating this process, multiple aspects of the PDR process, in particular PDR regulation, remain mysterious. In order to interrogate the regulation of this critical process, we have developed a small-molecule responsive biosensor that couples PDR transcriptional induction to growth rate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We applied this system to genome-wide screens for potential PDR regulators using the homozygous diploid deletion collection. These screens identified and characterized a series of genes with significant but previously uncharacterized roles in the modulation of the yeast PDR in addition to recapitulating previously-known factors involved in PDR regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that disruptions of the mitotic spindle checkpoint assembly lead to elevated PDR response in response to exposure to certain compounds. These results not only establish our biosensor system as a viable tool to investigate PDR in high-throughput, but also uncovers novel control mechanisms governing PDR response and a previously uncharacterized link between this process and cell cycle regulation.\n\nSignificancePleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) is a conserved mechanism by which cells utilize membrane bound pumps to transport chemicals out of the cell. Here, we develop a growth-based biosensor system in yeast that enables high-throughput identification of factors that transcriptionally regulate PDR. Among the novel PDR regulators identified here, we show that spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins, which are important for cell cycle regulation, inhibit hyperactivation of PDR upon drug treatment.

These \""hotspots\"" have been implicated in critical evolutionary innovations, as well as serious medical conditions. However, the evolutionary and biomedical features of these hotspots remain incompletely understood. In this study, we analyzed data from 2,504 genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium and constructed a refined map of 1,148 SV hotspots in human genomes. By studying the genomic architecture of these hotspots, we found that both nonallelic homologous recombination and non-homologous mechanisms act as mechanistic drivers of SV formation. We found that the majority of SV hotspots are within gene-poor regions and evolve under relaxed negative selection or neutrality. However, we found that a small subset of SV hotspots harbor genes that are enriched for anthropologically crucial functions, including blood oxygen transport, olfaction, synapse assembly, and antigen binding. We provide evidence that balancing selection may have maintained these SV hotspots, which include two independent hotspots on different chromosomes affecting alpha and beta hemoglobin gene clusters. Biomedically, we found that the SV hotspots coincide with breakpoints of clinically relevant, large de novo SVs, significantly more often than genome-wide expectations. As an example, we showed that the breakpoints of multiple large de novo SVs, which lead to idiopathic short stature, coincide with SV hotspots. As such, the mutational instability in SV hotpots likely enables chromosomal breaks that lead to pathogenic structural variation formations. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the mutational landscape of the genome and implicates both mechanistic and adaptive forces in the formation and maintenance of SV hotspots.","10.1093/gbe/evz058"

To test this hypothesis, we first developed a novel computational scoring system that enables quantitative assessment of surface electrostatic potential differences between donor and recipient HLA molecules at the tertiary structure level (electrostatic mismatch score-three dimensional; EMS-3D). We then examined humoral alloimmune responses in healthy females subjected to a standardised injection of donor lymphocytes from their male partner. This analysis showed a strong association between the EMS-3D of donor HLA and donor-specific alloantibody development; this relationship was strongest for HLA-DQ alloantigens. In the clinical transplantation setting, the immunogenic potential of HLA-DRB1 and -DQ mismatches expressed on donor kidneys, as assessed by their EMS-3D, was an independent predictor of development of donor-specific alloantibody after graft failure.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes these daily rhythms to the external light cycle, but the mechanisms by which this occurs is unclear. The neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is the predominant contributor to synchrony within the SCN and is important for circadian light responses, but the role of VIP neurons themselves is unclear. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that rhythmic SCN VIP neurons mediate circadian light responses. Using in vivo fiber photometry recording of SCN VIP neurons we found daily rhythms in spontaneous calcium events that peaked during the subjective day and in light-evoked calcium events that exhibited the greatest response around subjective dusk. These rhythms were correlated with spontaneous and NMDA-evoked VIP release from SCN VIP neurons in vitro. Finally, in vivo hyperpolarization of VIP neurons attenuated light-induced shifts of daily rhythms in locomotion. We conclude that SCN VIP neurons are circadian and depolarize to light to modulate entrainment of daily rhythms in the SCN and behavior.","NA"

Excitatory neurons receive inhibitory inputs that track excitation5-8. However, how this co-tuning of excitation and inhibition is achieved by cortical circuits is unclear, since inhibitory interneurons are thought to pool the inputs of nearby excitatory cells and provide them with non-specific inhibition proportional to the activity of the local network9-13. Here we show that although parvalbumin-expressing (PV) inhibitory cells in mouse primary visual cortex make connections with the majority of nearby pyramidal cells, the strength of their synaptic connections is structured according to the similarity of the cells responses. Individual PV cells strongly inhibit those pyramidal cells that provide them with strong excitation and share their visual selectivity. This fine-tuning of synaptic weights supports co-tuning of inhibitory and excitatory inputs onto individual pyramidal cells despite dense connectivity between inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Our results indicate that individual PV cells are preferentially integrated into subnetworks of inter-connected, co-tuned pyramidal cells, stabilising their recurrent dynamics. Conversely, weak but dense inhibitory connectivity between subnetworks is sufficient to support competition between them, de-correlating their output. We suggest that the history and structure of correlated firing adjusts the weights of both inhibitory and excitatory connections, supporting stable amplification and selective recruitment of cortical subnetworks.","NA"

It has been proposed that the receptive fields of neurons in oculomotor areas are remapped pre-saccadically to account for these shifts. While remapping of the whole visual scene seems prohibitively complex, selection by visual attention may limit these processes to a subset of attended locations. Because attentional selection consumes time, remapping of attended locations should evolve in time, too. In our study, we cued a spatial location by presenting an attention capturing cue at different times before a saccade and constructed detailed maps of attentional allocation across the visual field. We observed no remapping when the cue appeared shortly before saccade. In contrast, when the cue appeared sufficiently early before saccade, attentional resources were reallocated to the remapped location.

We assume a parametric mathematical model for biosensor response due to sources of mass such as analyte-ligand complexes. Some parameters represent interaction features, such as rate constants. Whenever we attempt to estimate parameters from data, we may obtain multiple estimates, regardless of the amount and quality of data. Inconveniently, we may be unable to distinguish between alternatives. This is problematic when alternative parameter values lead to very different predictions of system behaviour for a situation where we lack data. Anticipating this issue prior to data collection allows us to redesign the combination of planned experiments and model, replacing a certain failure to achieve our studys aim with the possibility of success. The literature on SPR biosensors (and computational biology more generally) has paid little attention to this matter. In order to remedy this, it is appropriate to begin with a consideration of the assumed models. These are rarely specified completely, causing ambiguity that impedes scrutiny of their properties and comparison with other models. We demonstrate this by reviewing some model types seen in the Biacore biosensor literature. We propose to eliminate model ambiguity by providing a suitable framework for specifing models for biosensor data. This framework will aid future efforts to compose models for data arising from particular interaction mechanisms in a form that is amenable to scrutiny.

However, accurate quantitative relationships between them remain largely unknown at present. To evaluate SESs contribution to protein-solvent interaction we have applied our accurate and robust SES computation algorithm to various sets of proteins and ligand-protein interfaces. Our results show that each of the analyzed water-soluble proteins has a negative net charge on its SES. In addition we have identified a list of SES-defined physical and geometrical properties that likely pertain to protein solvation and folding based on their characteristic changes with protein size, their differences between folded and extended conformations, and their correlations with known hydrophobicity scales and with experimentally-determined protein solubility. The relevance of the list of SES-defined properties to protein structure and function is supported by their differences between water-soluble proteins and transmembrane proteins and between solvent-accessible regions and ligand-binding interfaces. Taken together our analyses reveal the importance of SES for protein solvation, folding and function. In particular the universal enrichment of negative charge and the larger than average SES area for a polar atom on the surface of a water-soluble protein suggest that from a protein-solvent interaction perspective to fold into a native state is to optimize the electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between solvent molecules and the surface polar atoms of a protein rather than to only minimize its apolar surface area.","NA"

Here we study the population dynamics of spreading cells, investigating the characteristic processes involved in cell response to the substrate. We show that unlike the individual cell morphology, this population dynamics does not depend on the substrate stiffness. Instead, a strong activation temperature dependence is observed. Different cell lines on different substrates all have long-time statistics controlled by the thermal activation over a single energy barrier {triangleup}G {approx} 19 kcal/mol, while the early-time kinetics follows a power law ~ t5.

The priority given to interventions can depend strongly on how virulent the pathogen is, and interventions may also depend partly for their success on social processes that respond adaptively to disease dynamics. However, mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed. Here, our objective is to model the influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health efforts to control infectious diseases.","NA"

Whether or not this makes them inexhaustible suppliers for adaptive evolution will depend on the effect of non-genetic mutations (hereafter epimutations) on fitness-related traits. Here we investigate how the magnitude of these effects might themselves evolve. More specifically, we examine the hypothesis that natural selection could set boundaries to the adaptive potential of non-genetic inheritance media due to their higher mutability. In our model, the genetic and epigenetic contributions to a non-neutral phenotype are controlled by an epistatic modifier locus, which we let evolve under the combined effects of drift and selection, in stable and in variable environments. We show that a pure genetic control evolves when the environment is stable, provided that the population is large enough, such that the phenotype becomes robust to frequent epimutations. When the environment fluctuates, however, the direction of selection on the modifier locus also fluctuates and can overall produce a large non-genetic contribution to the phenotype, especially when the epimutation rate matches the rate of environmental variation. We further show that selection on the modifier locus is mostly direct - i.e. it does not rely on subsequent effects in future generations - as our results are generally insensitive to recombination. These results suggest that unstable inheritance media might significantly contribute to fitness variation of traits subject to highly variable selective pressures, but little to traits responding to scarcely variable aspects of the environment, which likely represent a majority. More generally, our study demonstrates that the rate of mutation and the adaptive potential of any inheritance media should not be seen as independent properties.","10.1086/704772"

CagY is an ortholog of VirB10 that, unlike other VirB10 orthologs, has a large middle repeat region (MRR) with extensive repetitive sequence motifs, which undergo CD4+ T cell-dependent recombination during infection of mice. Recombination in the CagY MRR reduces T4SS function, diminishes the host inflammatory response, and enables the bacteria to colonize at a higher density. Since CagY is known to bind human 5{beta}1 integrin, we tested the hypothesis that recombination in the CagY MRR regulates T4SS function by modulating binding to 5{beta}1 integrin. Using a cell-free microfluidic assay, we found that H. pylori binding to 5{beta}1 integrin under shear flow is dependent on the CagY MRR, but independent of the presence of the T4SS pili, which are only formed when H. pylori is in contact with host cells. Similarly, expression of CagY in the absence of other T4SS genes was necessary and sufficient for whole bacterial cell binding to 5{beta}1 integrin. Bacteria with variant cagY alleles that reduced T4SS function showed comparable reduction in binding to 5{beta}1 integrin, though CagY was still expressed on the bacterial surface. We speculate that cagY-dependent modulation of H. pylori T4SS function is mediated by alterations in binding to 5{beta}1 integrin, which in turn regulates the host inflammatory response so as to maximize persistent infection.\n\nIMPORTANCEInfection with H. pylori can cause peptic ulcers, and is the most important risk factor for gastric cancer, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The major H. pylori virulence factor that determines whether infection causes disease or asymptomatic colonization is the type IV secretion system (T4SS), a sort of molecular syringe that injects bacterial products into gastric epithelial cells and alters host cell physiology. We previously showed that recombination in CagY, an essential T4SS component, modulates the function of the T4SS. Here we found that these recombination events produce parallel changes in specific binding to 5{beta}1 integrin, a host cell receptor that is essential for T4SS-dependent translocation of bacterial effectors. We propose that CagY-dependent binding to 5{beta}1 integrin acts like a molecular rheostat that alters T4SS function and modulates the host immune response to promote persistent infection.","10.1128/mBio.00717-18"

In a broader survey with nine commercial maize hybrids and three field-collected fungal isolates, there was significant correlation between these seedling growth responses, as well as with later seedling blight severity.

Here, we describe a new statistical method for calling cells from droplet-based data, based on detecting significant deviations from the expression profile of the ambient solution. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our method has greater power than existing approaches for detecting cell libraries with low UMI counts, while controlling the false discovery rate among detected cells. We also apply our method to real data, where we show that the use of our method results in the retention of distinct cell types that would otherwise have been discarded.","10.1186/s13059-019-1662-y"

In a physiologic environment, the nanotube arrangement initiates with the spontaneous interaction among the terminal amino groups of polyamines and the phosphate ions, with the consequent formation of cyclic monomers that hook at DNA grooves. The polymer thus formed has the morphological features of an organic semiconductor and, therefore, can be considered able to conduce electric charges. Phosphate ions positioned on NAP external surface could regulate, as in a physical electric circuit, both protein linear and rotational (histones) motion, in accordance with the basilar principles of the electronics. A model of a carrier system for proteins motion along the polymer wrapping the DNA strands, based on the phosphate-phosphate complexation, is proposed.","NA"

Recently, single-cell transcriptomic data have been massively used for gene regulatory network inference, with both successes and limitations. In the present work we propose an iterative algorithm called WASABI, dedicated to inferring a causal dynamical network from time-stamped single-cell data, which tackles some of the limitations associated with current approaches. We first introduce the concept of waves, which posits that the information provided by an external stimulus will affect genes one-by-one through a cascade, like waves spreading through a network. This concept allows us to infer the network one gene at a time, after genes have been ordered regarding their time of regulation. We then demonstrate the ability of WASABI to correctly infer small networks, which have been simulated in silico using a mechanistic model consisting of coupled piecewise-deterministic Markov processes for the proper description of gene expression at the single-cell level. We finally apply WASABI on in vitro generated data on an avian model of erythroid differentiation. The structure of the resulting gene regulatory network sheds a fascinating new light on the molecular mechanisms controlling this process. In particular, we find no evidence for hub genes and a much more distributed network structure than expected. Interestingly, we find that a majority of genes are under the direct control of the differentiation-inducing stimulus. In conclusion, WASABI is a versatile algorithm which should help biologists to fully exploit the power of time-stamped single-cell data.","10.1186/s12859-019-2798-1"

This mechanism is thought to prevent cell differentiation and enable evasion of the immune system. Drugging the cancer epigenome with small molecule inhibitors to release silenced genes from the repressed state has emerged as a powerful approach for cancer research and drug development. Targets of these inhibitors include chromatin-modifying enzymes that can acquire drug-resistant mutations. In order to directly target a generally conserved feature, elevated trimethyl-lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), we developed the Polycomb-based Transcription Factor (PcTF), a fusion activator that targets methyl-histone marks via its N-terminal H3K27me3-binding motif, and co-regulates sets of silenced genes. Here, we report transcriptome profiling analyses of PcTF-treated breast cancer model cell lines. We identified a set of 19 PcTF-upregulated genes, or PUGs, that were consistent across three distinct breast cancer cell lines. These genes are associated with the interferon response pathway. Our results demonstrate for the first time a chromatin-mediated interferon-related transcriptional response driven by an engineered fusion protein that physically links repressive histone marks with active transcription.","10.1186/s12918-018-0608-4"

We demonstrate that systematic conservation planning is efficient for identifying priority areas representing a predefined part of the total genetic diversity of a whole landscape. With the exception of private allelic richness, classical genetic diversity indices (allelic richness, genetic uniqueness) were poor predictors for identifying priority areas. Moreover, we identified weak surrogacies among conservation solutions found for each species, implying that conservation solutions are highly species-specific.

RCAN2 was identified as the most strongly upregulated gene from a comparative RNAseq analysis of cells in which expression of the Golgi matrix protein giantin had been abolished by gene editing. In contrast to previous work where we showed that depletion of giantin by RNAi results in defects in ciliogenesis and in cilia length control, giantin knockout cells generate normal cilia on serum withdrawal. Furthermore, giantin knockout zebrafish show increased expression of RCAN2. Importantly, suppression of RCAN2 expression in giantin knockout cells results in the same defects in cilia length control seen on RNAi of giantin itself. Together these data define RCAN2 as a regulator of cilia function that can compensate for loss of giantin function.","10.1242/jcs.212258"

Many women with X chromosome aneuploidy undergo lifetime clinical monitoring for possible complications. However, ascertainment of cases in the clinic may mean that the phenotypic penetrance is overestimated. Studies of prenatally ascertained X chromosome aneuploidy cases have limited follow-up data and so the long-term consequences into adulthood are often not reported. We aimed to characterise the prevalence and phenotypic consequences of X chromosome aneuploidy in a large population of women over 40 years of age. We detected 30 women with 45,X, 186 with mosaic 45,X/46,XX and 110 with 47,XXX among 244,848 UK Biobank women, using SNP array data. The prevalence of non-mosaic 45,X (1/8,162) and 47,XXX (1/2,226) was lower than expected, but was higher for mosaic 45,X/46,XX (1/1,316). The characteristics of women with 45,X were consistent with the characteristics of a clinically recognised Turner syndrome phenotype, including a 17.2cm shorter stature (SD = 5.72cm; P = 1.5 x 10-53) and 16/30 did not report an age at menarche. The phenotype of women with 47,XXX included taller stature (5.3cm; SD = 5.52cm; P = 5.8 x 10-20), earlier menopause age (5.12 years; SD = 5.1 years; P = 1.2 x 10-14) and a lower fluid intelligence score (24%; SD = 29.7%; P = 3.7 x 10-8). In contrast, the characteristics of women with mosaic 45,X/46,XX were much less pronounced than expected. Women with mosaic 45,X/46,XX were less short, had a normal reproductive lifespan and birth rate, and no reported cardiovascular complications. In conclusion, the availability of data from 244,848 women allowed us to assess the phenotypic penetrance of traits associated with X chromosome aneuploidy in an adult population setting. Our results suggest that the clinical management of women with 45,X/46,XX mosaicism should be minimal, particularly those identified incidentally.\n\nFundingNone","10.1038/s41436-018-0271-6"

Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells.\n\nTo this end, we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data.\n\nOverall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohns disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (prs102275=1.44e-20, prs968567=2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs (all with p<0.05).\n\nIn summary, our study points towards a pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR- 3614-5p in autoimmunity.","NA"

Here, we present results from functional and structural analyses to reveal that Gp5.7 primarily serves to inhibit E{sigma}S, the predominant form of the RNAP in the stationary phase of growth, which accumulates in exponentially growing E. coli as a consequence of buildup of guanosine pentaphosphate ((p)ppGpp) during T7 development. We further demonstrate a requirement of Gp5.7 for T7 development in E. coli cells in the stationary phase of growth. Our finding represents a paradigm for how some lytic phages have evolved distinct mechanisms to inhibit the bacterial transcription machinery to facilitate phage development in bacteria in the exponential and stationary phases of growth.\n\nSignificance statementVirus that infect bacteria (phages) represent the most abundant living entities on the planet and many aspects of our fundamental knowledge of phage-bacteria relationships have been derived in the context of exponentially growing bacteria. In the case of the prototypical Escherichia coli phage T7, specific inhibition of the housekeeping form of the RNA polymerase (E{sigma}70) by a T7 protein, called Gp2, is essential for the development of viral progeny. We now reveal that T7 uses a second specific inhibitor that selectively inhibits the stationary phase RNAP (E{sigma}S), which enables T7 to develop well in exponentially growing and stationary phase bacteria. The results have broad implications for our understanding of phage-bacteria relationships and therapeutic application of phages.","10.1073/pnas.1800429115"

Excitatory neurons receive inhibitory inputs that track excitation5-8. However, how this co-tuning of excitation and inhibition is achieved by cortical circuits is unclear, since inhibitory interneurons are thought to pool the inputs of nearby excitatory cells and provide them with non-specific inhibition proportional to the activity of the local network9-13. Here we show that although parvalbumin-expressing (PV) inhibitory cells in mouse primary visual cortex make connections with the majority of nearby pyramidal cells, the strength of their synaptic connections is structured according to the similarity of the cells responses. Individual PV cells strongly inhibit those pyramidal cells that provide them with strong excitation and share their visual selectivity. This fine-tuning of synaptic weights supports co-tuning of inhibitory and excitatory inputs onto individual pyramidal cells despite dense connectivity between inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Our results indicate that individual PV cells are preferentially integrated into subnetworks of inter-connected, co-tuned pyramidal cells, stabilising their recurrent dynamics. Conversely, weak but dense inhibitory connectivity between subnetworks is sufficient to support competition between them, de-correlating their output. We suggest that the history and structure of correlated firing adjusts the weights of both inhibitory and excitatory connections, supporting stable amplification and selective recruitment of cortical subnetworks.","NA"

Further, phenocopies can lead to false negatives for some causal RVs if complete sharing among affecteds is required.

In the first 6 months of life, overall bacterial diversity, gut microbiota age, relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and microbial-predicted pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism were consistently increased; while relative abundances of pathways related to lipid, vitamin metabolism and detoxification were decreased in non-EBF vs. EBF infants. The perturbation in microbial-predicted pathways associated with non-EBF was larger in infants delivered by C-section than delivered vaginally. Longer duration of EBF mitigated diarrhea-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis and the effects of EBF persisted after 6 months of age.

Unsolved cases were explored by whole exome and genome sequencing looking for additional mutations. Candidate mutations were then validated by Sanger sequencing, quantitative PCR, and in vitro splicing assays in two cell lines analyzed through amplicon sequencing.\n\nResultsAmong 1722 families, three had biallelic loss of function mutations in RPGRIP1 while seven had a single disruptive coding mutation.

Thus, a putative humoral antibody response may be negligible.5 However, intracellular protein degradation processes lead to peptide presentation of Cas9 fragments on the cellular surface of gene-edited cells that may be recognized by T cells. While a primary T cell response could be prevented or delayed, a pre-existing memory would have major impact. Here, we show the presence of a ubiquitous memory/effector T cell response directed towards the most popular Cas9 homolog from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) within healthy human subjects. We have characterized SpCas9-reactive memory/effector T cells (TEFF) within the CD4/CD8 compartments for multi-effector potency and lineage determination. Intriguingly, SpCas9-specific regulatory T cells (TREG) profoundly contribute to the pre-existing SpCas9-directed T cell immunity. The frequency of SpCas9-reactive TREG cells inversely correlates with the magnitude of the respective TEFF response. SpCas9-specific TREG may be harnessed to ensure the success of SpCas9-mediated gene therapy by combating undesired TEFF response in vivo. Furthermore, the equilibrium of Cas9-specific TEFF and TREG cells may have greater importance in Streptococcus pyogenes-associated diseases. Our results shed light on the T cell mediated immunity towards the much-praised gene scissor SpCas9 and offer a possible solution to overcome the problem of pre-existing immunity.","10.1038/s41591-018-0204-6"

While certain potential advantages of manganese oxidation have been suggested, to date there is no conclusive experimental evidence for, how and if this process impacts microbial fitness in the environment. Here we show how a model organism for manganese oxidation, Roseobacter sp. AzwK-3b, is growth-inhibited by nitrite, and that this inhibition is mitigated when manganese is added to the culture medium. We show that manganese-mediated mitigation of nitrite-inhibition is dependent on the culture inoculum size, with larger inocula being able to withstand higher concentrations of nitrite stress. Furthermore, the bio-mineralized manganese oxide (MnOX) forms granular precipitates in the culture, rather than sheaths around individual cells. These findings support the notion that MnOX is a shared community product that improves the cultures survival against nitrite-stress. We show that the mechanistic basis of the MnOX effect involves both its ability to catalyze nitrite oxidation into (non-toxic) nitrate under physiological conditions, and its potential role in influencing redox chemistry around reactive oxygen species (ROS). Taken together, these results provide for the first direct evidence of improved microbial fitness by MnOX deposition in an ecological setting, i.e. mitigation of nitrite toxicity, and point to a key role of MnOX in handling stresses arising from ROS. These findings could be of general relevance for all organisms oxidizing manganese, allowing them to offset costs associated with extracellular bio-mineralization.","NA"

However, clinical development of any PrP-reducing therapeutic will require an appropriate pharmacodynamic biomarker: a practical and robust method for quantifying PrP, and reliably demonstrating its reduction, in the central nervous system (CNS) of a living patient. Here we evaluate the potential of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based quantification of human PrP in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to serve as a biomarker for PrP-reducing therapeutics. We show that CSF PrP is highly sensitive to plastic adsorption during handling and storage, but its loss can be minimized by addition of detergent. We find that blood contamination does not affect CSF PrP levels, and that CSF PrP and hemoglobin are uncorrelated, together suggesting that CSF PrP is CNS-derived, supporting its relevance for monitoring the tissue of interest and in keeping with high PrP abundance in brain relative to blood. In a cohort with controlled sample handling, CSF PrP exhibits good within-subject test-retest reliability (mean coefficient of variation 13% in samples collected 8-11 weeks apart), a sufficiently stable baseline to allow therapeutically meaningful reductions in brain PrP to be readily detected in CSF. Together, these findings supply a method for monitoring the effect of a PrP-reducing drug in the CNS, enabling the development of prion disease therapeutics with this mechanism of action.","10.1073/pnas.1901947116"

Currently, three Cas9 orthologs have been adapted for in vivo genome engineering applications: SpyCas9, SauCas9 and CjeCas9. However, additional in vivo editing platforms are needed, in part to enable a greater range of sequences to be accessed via viral vectors, especially those in which Cas9 and sgRNA are combined into a single vector genome. Here, we present an additional in vivo editing platform using Neisseria meningitidis Cas9 (NmeCas9). NmeCas9 is compact, edits with high accuracy, and possesses a distinct PAM, making it an excellent candidate for safe gene therapy applications. We find that NmeCas9 can be used to target the Pcsk9 and Hpd genes in mice. Using tail vein hydrodynamic-based delivery of NmeCas9 plasmid to target the Hpd gene, we successfully reprogrammed the tyrosine degradation pathway in Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type I mice. More importantly, we delivered NmeCas9 with its single-guide RNA in a single recombinant adeno-associated vector (rAAV) to target Pcsk9, resulting in lower cholesterol levels in mice.

How the rhythmic pattern is generated and propagated along the body is not yet well understood. We report on the development and analysis of a model of forward locomotion that integrates the neuroanatomy, neurophysiology and body mechanics of the worm. Our model is motivated by experimental analysis of the structure of the ventral cord circuitry and the effect of local body curvature on nearby motoneurons. We developed a neuroanatomically-grounded model of the head motoneuron circuit and the ventral nerve cord circuit. We integrated the neural model with an existing biomechanical model of the worm s body, with updated musculature and stretch receptors. Unknown parameters were evolved using an evolutionary algorithm to match the speed of the worm on agar. We performed 100 evolutionary runs and consistently found electrophysiological configurations that reproduced realistic control of forward movement. The ensemble of successful solutions reproduced key experimental observations that they were not designed to fit, including the wavelength and frequency of the propagating wave. Analysis of the ensemble revealed that head motoneurons SMD and RMD are sufficient to drive dorsoventral undulations in the head and neck and that short-range posteriorly-directed proprioceptive feedback is sufficient to propagate the wave along the rest of the body.","10.1098/rstb.2017.0374"

After brain injury, the cerebral cortex is especially difficult to repair due to its extremely low rate of adult neurogenesis. Previous studies have converted glial cells into neurons, but the total number of neurons generated is rather limited, casting doubt about its therapeutic potential. Here, we demonstrate that high-efficiency neuroregeneration can be achieved in adult mammalian brains by making use of an engineered AAV Cre-FLEX system to convert a large number of reactive astrocytes into functional neurons. Specifically, using a combination of GFAP::Cre and FLEX-NeuroD1 AAV system, we were able to regenerate enough new neurons from astrocytes to cover about 40% of the neurons lost from an ischemic injury (400 NeuN+ new neurons/mm2), compared to previously reported an average of <1% of cortical neurons (2-8 NeuN+ neurons/mm2) in an ischemic-injured adult mammalian cortex. Importantly, this in situ astrocyte-to-neuron conversion process also improved survival of injured pre-existing neurons, (additional 400 neurons/mm2), leading to a repaired motor cortex with layered cortical structures. Moreover, NeuroD1-converted neurons not only form functional neural circuits but also rescue motor and memory deficits after ischemic injury. Our results establish the proof-of-principle that a highly efficient in situ astrocyte-to-neuron conversion approach provides a novel treatment for neurological disorders that are in need of new neurons.","10.1016/j.ymthe.2019.09.003"

Additional filtration criteria and population-level understanding may help to produce refined lists of putative neoantigens. Herein, we show neoepitope immunogenicity is likely related to measures of peptide novelty and report population-level behavior of these and other metrics.\n\nMethodsWe propose four peptide novelty metrics to refine predicted neoantigenicity: tumor vs. paired normal peptide binding affinity difference, tumor vs. paired normal peptide sequence similarity, tumor vs. closest human peptide sequence similarity, and tumor vs. closest microbial peptide sequence similarity. We apply these metrics to tumor neoepitopes predicted from somatic missense mutations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and a cohort of melanoma patients, as well as to a group of peptides with neoepitope-specific immune response data using an extension of pVAC-Seq [1].\n\nResultsWe show neoepitope burden varies across TCGA disease sites and HLA alleles, with surprisingly low repetition of neoepitope sequences across patients or neoepitope preferences among sets of HLA alleles. Only 20.3% of predicted neoepitopes across TCGA patients displayed novel binding change based on our binding affinity difference criteria. Similarity of amino acid sequence was typically high between paired tumor-normal epitopes, but in 24.6% of cases, neoepitopes were more similar to other human peptides, or even to bacterial (56.8% of cases) or viral peptides (15.5% of cases), than their paired normal counterparts. Applied to peptides with neoepitope-specific immune response, a linear model incorporating neoepitope binding affinity, protein sequence similarity between neoepitopes and their closest viral peptides, and paired binding affinity difference was able to predict immunogenicity with an AUROC of 0.66.\n\nConclusionsOur proposed neoepitope prioritization criteria emphasize neoepitope novelty and refine patient neoepitope predictions for focus on biologically meaningful candidate neoantigens. We have demonstrated that neoepitopes should be considered not only with respect to their paired normal epitope, but with respect to the entire human proteome, as well as bacterial and viral peptides, with potential implications for neoepitope immunogenicity and personalized vaccines for cancer treatment. We conclude that putative neoantigens are highly variable across individuals as a function of both cancer genetics and personalized HLA repertoire, while the overall behavior of filtration criteria reflects predictable patterns.","10.1186/s12885-018-4325-6"

We discovered that despite substantial differences in individual chemotactic abilities, the cells are able to migrate as a coherent group by spontaneously sorting themselves within the moving band. This sorting mechanism ensures that differences between individual chemotactic abilities are compensated by differences in the local steepness of the traveling gradient each individual must navigate, and determines the minimum performance required to travel with the band.

After inhibiting translation for ~1 hour, the presynaptic terminal exhibits increased spontaneous release, and increased evoked release with an increase in vesicle recycling during stimulation trains.

While some studies suggested that prefrontal cortical neurons active during learning are required for memory retrieval13-15, others provided evidence for ongoing cortical circuit reorganization during memory consolidation10,16,17. It has been difficult to causally relate the activity of cortical neurons during learning or recent memory retrieval to their function in remote memory, in part due to a lack of tools18. Here we show that a new version of  targeted recombination in active populations, TRAP2, has enhanced efficiency over the past version, providing brain-wide access to neurons activated by a particular experience. Using TRAP2, we accessed PL neurons activated during fear conditioning or 1-, 7-, or 14-day memory retrieval, and assessed their contributions to 28-day remote memory. We found that PL neurons TRAPed at later retrieval times were more likely to be reactivated during remote memory retrieval, and more effectively promoted remote memory retrieval. Furthermore, reducing PL activity during learning blunted the ability of TRAPed PL neurons to promote remote memory retrieval. Finally, a series of whole-brain analyses identified a set of cortical regions that were densely innervated by memory-TRAPed PL neurons and preferentially activated by PL neurons TRAPed during 14-day retrieval, and whose activity co-varied with PL and correlated with memory specificity. These findings support a model in which PL ensembles underlying remote memory undergo dynamic changes during the first two weeks after learning, which manifest as increased functional recruitment of cortical targets.","10.1038/s41593-018-0318-7"

Challenge participants used machine learning and clustering techniques to predict ALS progression and survival. By developing new approaches, the best performing teams were able to predict disease outcomes better than currently available methods. At the same time, the integration of clustering components across methods led to the emergence of distinct consensus clusters, separating patients into four consistent groups, each with its unique predictors for classification. This analysis reveals for the first time the potential of a crowdsourcing approach to uncover covert patient sub-populations, and to accelerate disease understanding and therapeutic development.","10.1038/s41598-018-36873-4"

Xing","Carnegie Mellon University","2018-04-05",1,"15","new results","bioinformatics","In many applications, inter-sample heterogeneity is crucial to understanding the complex biological processes under study. For example, in genomic analysis of cancers, each patient in a cohort may have a different driver mutation, making it difficult or impossible to identify causal mutations from an averaged view of the entire cohort. Unfortunately, many traditional methods for genomic analysis seek to estimate a single model which is shared by all samples in a population, ignoring this inter-sample heterogeneity entirely. In order to better understand patient heterogeneity, it is necessary to develop practical, personalized statistical models. To uncover this inter-sample heterogeneity, we propose a novel regularizer for achieving patient-specific personalized estimation. This regularizer operates by learning two latent distance metrics - one between personalized parameters and one between clinical covariates - and attempting to match the induced distances as closely as possible. Crucially, we do not assume these distance metrics are already known. Instead, we allow the data to dictate the structure of these latent distance metrics. Finally, we apply our method to learn patient-specific, interpretable models for a pan-cancer gene expression dataset containing samples from more than 30 distinct cancer types and find strong evidence of personalization effects between cancer types as well as between individuals. Our analysis uncovers sample-specific aberrations that are overlooked by population level methods, suggesting a promising new path for precision analysis of complex diseases such as cancer.","10.1093/bioinformatics/bty250"

They also play an important role in sensing and instructing cells on their metabolic state. The lipid kinase PIKfyve generates phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate to modulate lysosome function. PIKfyve inhibition leads to impaired degradative capacity, ion dysregulation, abated autophagic flux, and a massive enlargement of lysosomes. Collectively, this leads to various physiological defects including embryonic lethality, neurodegeneration and overt inflammation. While being the most dramatic phenotype, the reasons for lysosome enlargement remain unclear. Here, we examined whether biosynthesis and/or fusion-fission dynamics contribute to swelling. First, we show that PIKfyve inhibition activates TFEB, TFE3 and MITF enhancing lysosome gene expression. However, this did not augment lysosomal protein levels during acute PIKfyve inhibition and deletion of TFEB and/or related proteins did not impair lysosome swelling. Instead, PIKfyve inhibition led to fewer but enlarged lysosomes, suggesting that an imbalance favouring lysosome fusion over fission causes lysosome enlargement. Indeed, conditions that abated fusion curtailed lysosome swelling in PIKfyve-inhibited cells.\n\nSummary statementPIKfyve inhibition causes lysosomes to coalesce, resulting in fewer, enlarged lysosomes.

Yet, whether the ducts are capable of regenerating after genotoxic injury, or if damage to ductal cells induces lineage plasticity, as has been reported in other organ systems, remains unknown. Here, we show that two ductal progenitor populations marked by KRT14 and KIT exclusively maintain non-overlapping ductal compartments after radiation exposure but do so through distinct cellular mechanisms. KRT14+ progenitor cells are fast cycling cells that proliferate in response to radiation-induced damage in a sustained manner and divide asymmetrically to produce differentiated cells of the larger granulated ducts. Conversely, KIT+ cells are long lived progenitors for the intercalated ducts that undergo few cell divisions either during homeostasis or after gamma radiation, thus maintaining ductal architecture in the near absence of cell turnover. Together, these data illustrate the regenerative capacity of the salivary ducts and highlight the heterogeneity in the damage responses used by salivary progenitor cells to maintain tissue architecture.\n\nSummary StatementThe salivary gland ductal network is maintained during homeostasis and after genotoxic injury by diverse progenitors that respond differentially to radiation induced damage.","10.1242/dev.166363"

Here we examine the chemotaxis of the soil amoeba and professional phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum in assays where amoebae were presented with a paired choice of different bacteria. We observed variation in the extent to which they pursue different types of bacteria and preferential migration towards Gram-negative over Gram-positive bacteria. Response profiles were similar for amoebae isolated from different geographic locations, suggesting that chemotaxis preferences are not strongly influenced by any local variation in the bacterial community. Because cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a known chemoattractant for D. discoideum, we tested whether it mediated the preference for Gram-negative bacteria. Chemotaxis was diminished in response to a cAMP-deficient strain of Escherichia coli and enhanced in response to an E. coli strain that overproduces cAMP. We conclude that D. discoideum discriminates at a distance among bacteria and that discrimination is mediated in part by sensing of cAMP. Preferential sensing and response to different bacteria may help to explain why some amoeba-bacterial associations are more prevalent in nature than others.","NA"

Our phylogenetic results were largely congruent with previous analyses, but we identified several early diverging nodes characterized by extensive gene tree conflict. For particularly contentious nodes, we presented detailed information about the phylogenetic signal for alternative relationships. We also analyzed the frequency of gene duplications, confirmed previously identified whole genome duplications (WGD), and identified a previously unidentified WGD event within the Didiereaceae. We found that the WGD events were typically associated with shifts in climatic niche and did not find a direct association with WGDs and diversification rate shifts. Diversification shifts occurred within the Portulacaceae, Cactaceae, and Anacampserotaceae, and while these did not experience WGDs, the Cactaceae experienced extensive gene duplications. We examined gene family expansion and molecular evolutionary patterns with a focus on genes associated with environmental stress responses and found evidence for significant gene family expansion in genes with stress adaptation and clades found in extreme environments.

Unlike other birds, paleognaths (ratites and tinamous) possess large non-degenerate regions on their sex chromosomes (PARs or pseudoautosomal regions). It remains unclear why these large PARs are retained over more than 100 MY, and how this retention impacts the evolution of sex chromosomes within this system. To address this puzzle, we analysed Z chromosome evolution and gene expression across 12 paleognaths, several of whose genomes have recently been sequenced. We confirm at the genomic level that most paleognaths retain large PARs. As in other birds, we find that all paleognaths have incomplete dosage compensation on the regions of the Z chromosome homologous to degenerated portions of the W (differentiated regions or DRs), but we find no evidence for enrichments of male-biased genes in PARs. We find limited evidence for increased evolutionary rates (faster-Z) either across the chromosome or in DRs for most paleognaths with large PARs, but do recover signals of faster-Z evolution in tinamou species with mostly degenerated W chromosomes, similar to the pattern seen in neognaths. Unexpectedly, in some species PAR-linked genes evolve faster on average than genes on autosomes, suggested by diverse genomic features to be due to reduced efficacy of selection in paleognath PARs. Our analysis shows that paleognath Z chromosomes are atypical at the genomic level, but the evolutionary forces maintaining largely homomorphic sex chromosomes in these species remain elusive.","10.1093/gbe/evz154"

The seaweed fly Coelopa frigida provides an excellent model for the study of genetically driven phenotypes because it carries an /{beta} inversion polymorphism that affects body size. Coelopa frigida inhabits highly variable beds of decomposing seaweed on the coast in Scandinavia thus providing a suitable test ground to investigate the genetic effects of substrate on both the frequency of the inversion (directional selection) and on the phenotype (genotype x environment effects). Here we use a reciprocal transplant experiment to test the effect of the /{beta} inversion on body size traits and development time across four suitable natural breeding substrates from the clinal distribution. We show that while development time is unaffected by GxE effects, both the frequency of the inversion and the relative phenotypic effects of the inversion on body size differ between population x substrate combinations. This indicates that the environment modulates the fitness as well as the phenotypic effects of the inversion karyotypes. It further suggests that the inversion may have accumulated qualitatively different mutations in different populations that interact with the environment. Together our results are consistent with the idea that the inversion in C. frigida likely evolves via a combination of local mutation, GxE effects, and differential fitness of inversion karyotypes in heterogeneous environments.","NA"

The challenge of VUS is epitomized by BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene integral to DNA repair and genomic stability. Germline BRCA1 loss-of-function (LOF) variants predispose women to early-onset breast and ovarian cancers. Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of women, the risk associated with most newly observed variants cannot be definitively assigned. Data sharing attenuates this problem but it is unlikely to solve it, as most newly observed variants are exceedingly rare. In lieu of genetic evidence, experimental approaches can be used to functionally characterize VUS. However, to date, functional studies of BRCA1 VUS have been conducted in a post hoc, piecemeal fashion. Here we employ saturation genome editing to assay 96.5% of all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode functionally critical domains of BRCA1. Our assay measures cellular fitness in a haploid human cell line whose survival is dependent on intact BRCA1 function. The resulting function scores for nearly 4,000 SNVs are bimodally distributed and almost perfectly concordant with established assessments of pathogenicity. Sequence-function maps enhanced by parallel measurements of variant effects on mRNA levels reveal mechanisms by which loss-of-function SNVs arise. Hundreds of missense SNVs critical for protein function are identified, as well as dozens of exonic and intronic SNVs that compromise BRCA1 function by disrupting splicing or transcript stability. We predict that these function scores will be directly useful for the clinical interpretation of cancer risk based on BRCA1 sequencing. Furthermore, we propose that this paradigm can be extended to overcome the challenge of VUS in other genes in which genetic variation is clinically actionable.","10.1038/s41586-018-0461-z"

The current study aimed to characterize the genomic changes within Mav isolates collected from single patients over time and test the host immune responses to these clinical isolates. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis and whole genome sequencing was performed on 40 MAC isolates isolated from 15 patients at the Department of Medical Microbiology at St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim, Norway. Patients (4, 9 and 13) who contributed more than two isolates were selected for further analysis. These isolates exhibited extensive sequence variation in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), suggesting that Mav accumulates mutations at high rates during persistent infections.

The study revealed rapid genetic evolution of Mav in chronically infected patients accompanied with change in virulence properties of the sequential mycobacterial isolates.\n\nIMPORTANCEMAC are a group of opportunistic pathogens, consisting of Mav and M. intracellulare species. Mav is found ubiquitously in the environment. In Mav infected individuals, Mav has been known to persist for long periods of time, and anti-mycobacterial drugs are unable to effectively clear the infection. The continued presence of the bacteria, could be attributed to either a single persistent strain or reinfection with the same or different strain. We examined sequential isolates collected over time from Mav infected individuals and observed that most patients carried the same strain overtime and were not re infected. We observed high rates of mutation within the serial isolates, accompanied with changes in virulence properties. In the light of increase in incidence of MAC related infections, this study highlights the possibility that host adapted Mav undergo genetic modifications to cope with the host environment and thereby persisting longer.","10.1128/iai.00323-18"

However, the development of PPVs is hindered by the challenge of identifying tumor-specific neoantigens, in part because current in silico methods for identifying such neoantigens have limited effectiveness. Here we report the results of molecular dynamics simulations of 12 oligopeptides bound with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA), revealing a previously unrecognized association between the inability of an oligopeptide to elicit a T-cell response and the contraction of the peptide-binding groove upon binding of the oligopeptide to the HLA. Our conformational analysis showed that this association was due to incompatibility at the interface between the contracted groove and its {beta}-T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). This structural demonstration that having the capability to bind HLA does not guarantee immunogenicity prompted us to develop an atom-based method [Formula] to predict immunogenicity through using the structure and energy of a peptide*HLA complex to assess the propensity of the complex for forming a ternary complex with its TCR. In predicting the immunogenicities of the 12 oligopeptides, [Formula] achieved a 100% success rate compared with success rates of 25-50% for 11 publicly available residue-based methods including NetMHC-4.0.

The examination of the E. coli from longitudinal samples from multiple children in Tanzania provides insight into the genomic diversity and population variability of resident E. coli within the rapidly changing environment of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nImportanceThis study increases the number of resident Escherichia coli genome sequences, and explores E. coli diversity through longitudinal sampling. We investigate the genomes of E. coli isolated from human gastrointestinal tracts as part of an antibiotic treatment program among rural Tanzanian children. Phylogenomics demonstrates that resident E. coli are diverse, even within a single host. Though the E. coli isolates of the gastrointestinal community tend to be phylogenomically similar at a given time, they differed across the interrogated time points, demonstrating the variability of the members of the E. coli community. Exposure to antibiotic treatment did not have an apparent impact on the E. coli community or the presence of resistance and virulence genes within E. coli genomes. The findings of this study highlight the variable nature of bacterial members of the human gastrointestinal tract.","NA"

Yet, tests of this hypothesis have proved inconclusive. Using the rodent malaria Plasmodium chabaudi, we examine rhythms in the density and infectivity of transmission forms (gametocytes) in the hosts blood, parasite development inside mosquitoes, and onwards transmission.Moreover, we control for the confounding effects of rhythms in mosquito susceptibility. We reveal that at night, gametocytes are twice as infective to mosquitoes, despite being less numerous in the blood. This enhanced infectiousness at night interacts with mosquito rhythms to increase sporozoite burdens by almost four-fold when mosquitoes feed during their day. Thus, daytime blood-feeding (e.g. driven by the use of bed nets) may render gametocytes less infective, but this is compensated for by the greater susceptibility of mosquitoes.","10.1098/rspb.2018.1876"

The Cdt1 protein is essential for MCM loading during G1 phase of the cell cycle, yet the mechanism of Cdt1 function is still incompletely understood. We examined a collection of rare Cdt1 variants that cause a form of primordial dwarfism (Meier-Gorlin syndrome) plus one hypomorphic Drosophila allele to shed light on Cdt1 function. Three hypomorphic variants load MCM less efficiently than WT Cdt1, and their lower activity correlates with impaired MCM binding. A structural homology model of the human Cdt1-MCM complex position the altered Cdt1 residues at two distinct interfaces rather than the previously described single MCM interaction domain. Surprisingly, one dwarfism allele (Cdt1-A66T) is more active than WT Cdt1. This hypermorphic variant binds both Cyclin A and SCFSkp2 poorly relative to WT Cdt1. Detailed quantitative live cell imaging analysis demonstrated no change in stability of this variant however. Instead, we propose that Cyclin A/CDK inhibits Cdt1 licensing function independently of the creation of the SCFSkp2 phosphodegron. Together, these findings identify key Cdt1 interactions required for both efficient origin licensing and tight Cdt1 regulation to ensure normal cell proliferation and genome stability.","10.1091/mbc.e18-04-0242"

Here we describe a modified electrophysiological setup that allowed recordings of visually evoked responses while perfusing the brain in vivo. Long-lasting recordings from wide-field motion sensitive neurons of the hoverfly pollinator, Eristalis tenax, revealed that sub-lethal exposure to imidacloprid alters their physiological response to motion stimuli. We observed substantially increased spontaneous firing rate, reduced contrast sensitivity and weaker directional tuning to wide-field moving stimuli.

However, when ZIKV emerged in Brazil 2015 the attention increased rapidly. The announcement by Brazilian authorities, that ZIKV infection was associated with severe congenital disease e.g. microcephaly, surged public interest. Because of the accumulation of evidence that showed the magnitude of the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern February 1, 2016.\n\nResultsDuring 2015-2017, we witnessed one of the most active and cooperated research responses against an emerging disease. To investigate the impact of ZIKV research during those years we decided to perform a bibliometric analysis of ZIKV research. The search for research articles on ZIKV was performed by bibliometric analysis from the scientific databases PubMed and Scopus. We found that the number of ZIKV related publications increased 38-41 times in 2016-2017 compared to 2015. During the three years there was a temporal shift in ZIKV research trends, from reports of ZIKV case studies and diagnostic methods, to development of ZIKV prevention and treatment. In addition, the number of countries involved in ZIKV research increased from 25 in 2015 to 111 in 2016 and 139 in the following year, showing that ZIKV research became global during three years.\n\nConclusionsThe results from our study highlighted the importance of gathering public interest to global health issues, and how it can act as a powerful catalyzer to trigger the research field. However, despite the progress in ZIKV research, many questions remain to be addressed to accelerate the development of effective ZIKV countermeasures. Nevertheless, as long as we remember the importance of support and collaboration that we have experienced during the multidisciplinary effort against the current ZIKV outbreak, we will have an idea on how to handle the next inevitable and yet unknown infectious disease threat.","NA"

This task can be computationally challenging due to the presence of local optima and ill-conditioning. While a variety of optimization methods have been suggested to surmount these issues, it is not obvious how to choose the best one for a given problem a priori, since many factors can influence their performance. A systematic comparison of methods that are suited to parameter estimation problems of sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of optimization variables is currently missing, and smaller studies indeed provided contradictory findings.\n\nResultsHere, we use a collection of benchmark problems to evaluate the performance of two families of optimization methods: (i) a multi-start of deterministic local searches; and (ii) a hybrid metaheuristic combining stochastic global search with deterministic local searches. A fair comparison is ensured through a collaborative evaluation, involving researchers applying each method on a daily basis, and a consideration of multiple performance metrics capturing the trade-off between computational efficiency and robustness. Our results show that, thanks to recent advances in the calculation of parametric sensitivities, a multi-start of gradient-based local methods is often a successful strategy, but a better performance can be obtained with a hybrid metaheuristic. The best performer is a combination of a global scatter search metaheuristic with an interior point local method, provided with gradients estimated with adjoint-based sensitivities.

Thanks to the genome data, the footprints of adaptive (positive) selection are detectable, and the strength of purifying selection can be measured. This has made possible to know where, in the metabolic network, adaptive selection has acted and where purifying selection is more or less strong and efficient. We have carried out a comprehensive molecular evolutionary study of all the genes involved in the human metabolism. We investigated the type and strength of the selective pressures that acted on the enzyme-coding genes belonging to metabolic pathways during the divergence of primates and rodents. Then, we related those selective pressures to the functional and topological characteristics of the pathways. We have used DNA sequences of all enzymes (956) of the metabolic pathways comprised in the HumanCyc database, using genome data for humans and five other mammalian species.\n\nWe have found that the evolution of metabolic genes is primarily constrained by the layer of the metabolism in which the genes participate: while genes encoding enzymes of the inner core of metabolism are much conserved, those encoding enzymes participating in the outer layer, mediating the interaction with the environment, are evolutionarily less constrained and more plastic, having experienced faster functional evolution. Genes that have been targeted by adaptive selection are endowed by higher out-degree centralities than non-adaptive genes, while genes with high in-degree centralities are under stronger purifying selection. When the position along the pathway is considered, a funnel-like distribution of the strength of the purifying selection is found. Genes at bottom positions are highly preserved by purifying selection, whereas genes at top positions, catalyzing the first steps, are open to evolutionary changes.\n\nThese results show how functional and topological characteristics of metabolic pathways contribute to shape the patterns of evolutionary pressures driven by natural selection and how pathway network structure matters in the evolutionary process that shapes the evolution of the system.","10.1371/journal.pone.0208782"

Cell-free DNA aneuploidy testing was based on cell line (47,XX,+21) genomic DNA. TAC-seq mRNA biomarker profiling showed identical clustering results to full transcriptome RNA sequencing, and microRNA detection demonstrated significant reduction in amplification bias, allowing to determine minor expression changes between different samples that remained undetermined by standard sequencing. The mimicking experiment for cell-free DNA fetal aneuploidy analysis showed that TAC-seq can be applied to count highly fragmented DNA, detecting significant (p=4.8x10-11) excess of molecules in case of trisomy 21.

Previous studies of global gene expression changes induced by HPV infection have focused on the cancerous stages of infection, and therefore, not much is known about global gene expression changes at early pre-neoplastic stages of infection. We show for the first time, global gene expression changes of early stage HPV16 infection in cervical tissue using 3-dimensional organotypic raft cultures that produce high levels of progeny virions.\n\ncDNA microarray analysis showed that a total of 594 genes were upregulated and 651 genes were downregulated at least 1.5-fold with HPV16 infection. Gene ontology analysis showed that biological processes including cell cycle progression and DNA metabolism were upregulated, while skin development, immune response, and cell death were downregulated with HPV16 infection in cervical keratinocytes. Individual genes were selected for validation at the transcriptional and translational levels including UBC, which was central to the protein association network of immune response genes, and top downregulated genes RPTN, SERPINB4, KRT23, and KLK8. In particular, KLK8 and SERPINB4 have shown to be upregulated in cancer, which contrasts our results.\n\nOrganotypic raft cultures that allow full progression of the HPV life-cycle have allowed us to identify novel gene modulations and potential therapeutic targets of early stage HPV infection in cervical tissue. Additionally, our results suggest that early stage productive infection and cancerous stages of infection are distinct disease states expressing different transcriptomes.\n\nImportancePersistent HPV infection is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer. Transition from precancerous to cancerous stages of HPV infection is marked by a significant reduction in virus production. Most global gene expression studies of HPV infection have focused on the cancerous stages. Therefore, little is known about global gene expression changes at precancerous stages. For the first time, we measured global gene expression changes at precancerous stages of HPV16 infection in human cervical tissue producing high levels of virus. We identified a group of genes that are typically overexpressed in cancerous stages to be significantly downregulated at the precancerous stage. Moreover, we identified significantly modulated genes that have not yet been studied in the context of HPV infection. Studying the role of these genes in HPV infection will help us understand what drives the transition from precancerous to cancerous stages, and may lead to development of new therapeutic targets.","10.1128/jvi.01261-18"

They are responsible for a spectrum of key physiological processes in living organisms, including electric signaling and progression along the cell cycle. While the voltage-sensing mechanism has been well characterized for some membrane proteins such as voltage-gated ion channels, for others even the location of the voltage-sensing elements remains unknown. The detection of these elements using experimental techniques is complicated due to the large diversity of membrane proteins. Here, we suggest a computational approach to predict voltage-sensing elements in any membrane protein independent of structure or function. It relies on the estimation of the capacity of a protein to respond to changes in the membrane potential. We first show how this property correlates well with voltage sensitivity by applying our approach to a set of membrane proteins including voltage-sensitive and voltage-insensitive ones. We further show that it correctly identifies true voltage-sensitive residues in the voltage sensor domain of voltage-gated ion channels. Finally, we investigate six membrane proteins for which the voltage-sensing elements have not yet been characterized and identify residues and ions potentially involved in the response to voltage. The suggested approach is fast and simple and allows for characterization of voltage sensitivity that goes beyond mere identification of charges.

Here, we synthesize global phylogenetic and macroecological data on a hyperdiverse (>1100 species) ant radiation, Pheidole, and evaluate the roles of three general explanations for the latitudinal gradient: variation in diversification rate, tropical conservatism, and ecological regulation.\n\nLocationGlobal.\n\nTime PeriodThe past 35 million years.\n\nMajor taxa studiedThe hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole Westwood.\n\nMethodsWe assembled geographic data for 1499 species and morphospecies, and inferred a dated phylogeny of Pheidole of 449 species, including 150 species newly sequenced for this study. We tested correlations between diversification rate and latitude with BAMM, HiSSE, GeoSSE, and FiSSE, and examined patterns of diversification as Pheidole spread around the globe.\n\nResultsWe found that Pheidole diversification occurred in series of bursts when new continents were colonized, followed by a slowdown in each region. There was no evidence of systematic variation of net diversification rates with latitude across any of the methods. Additionally, we found latitudinal affinity is moderately conserved with a Neotropical ancestor and phylogenetic inertia alone is sufficient to produce the gradient pattern.\n\nMain ConclusionsOverall our results are consistent with tropical conservatism explaining the diversity gradient, while providing no evidence that diversification rate varies systematically with latitude. There is evidence of ecological regulation on continental scales through the pattern of diversification after colonization.

Gut microbiomes are becoming recognized as important players in organism health, with comprehension of their perturbations in the polluted environment offering new insights into the nature and extent of heavy metal effects on the health of soil biota. Our aim was therefore to evaluate the effect of environmentally relevant heavy metal concentrations of cadmium (Cd) on the earthworm gut microbiota. Cd exposure led to perturbations of several heavy metal resistant taxa as well as taxa able to bind heavy metals, revealing the potential of the earthworm-microbiota system in overcoming humancaused heavy metal pollution. An  indicator species analysis linked bacterial genera Paenibacillus and Flavobacterium, and members of the order Actinomycetales with Cd treatment, suggesting the possible use of these bacterial taxa as biomarkers of exposure for Cd stressed soils. The results of this study will be essential to understanding of the soil fauna health, under anthropogenic disturbance, and will have implications for environmental monitoring and protection of soil resources.\n\nImportanceSoil heavy metal pollution presents a severe burden for soil invertebrates and can have impact on their health, which in turn reflects on the health of the entire ecosystem. Gut microbiome is recognized as a central driver of the host health and its shifts can have severe consequences for the host. In this study we investigated the impact of cadmium (Cd) on earthworm gut microbiota, in a controlled experiment using cutting edge next generation sequencing and state of the art bioinformatics tools. The significance of this study is in identifying the gut bacterial taxa which are indicators for Cd treatment and are potential biomarkers of exposure to Cd. Therefore, this study contributes to develop efficient measures to qualify environmental pollution and to protect fragile soil resources and ultimately human health.","10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.12.102"

Whereas enhanced synaptic strength and structural changes accompany the learning of motor tasks, the persistent molecular modifications that store long-term procedural memories within specific layers of sensorimotor cortex have not been identified. The persistent increase in the autonomously active, atypical PKC isoform, PKM{zeta}, is a putative molecular mechanism for maintaining enhanced synaptic strength during long-term potentiation (LTP) and several forms of long-term memory. Here we examine whether persistent increases in PKM{zeta} store long-term memory for a reaching task in rat sensorimotor cortex that could reveal the sites of procedural memory storage. Perturbing PKM{zeta} synthesis with PKM{zeta} -antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or blocking atypical PKC activity with zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) in S1/M1 disrupts and erases the maintenance of long-term motor memories. Only memories that are maintained without daily reinforcement are affected, indicating atypical PKCs (via ZIP) and PKM{zeta} specifically (via antisense) stores consolidated long-term procedural memories. Analysis of changes in the amount of PKM{zeta} in S1/M1 reveals PKM{zeta} increases in layers II/III and V of both S1 and M1 cortices as performance improves to an asymptote during training. After storage for 1 month without reinforcement, the increase in M1 layer V but not other layers persists without decrement. Thus, the sustained increases in PKM{zeta} reveal that the persistent molecular changes storing long-term procedural memory are localized to the descending output layer of primary motor cortex.","10.1016/j.isci.2018.07.002"

To identify variants with regulatory functions in cattle, an important economic and model species, we used sequence variants to map a type of expression quantitative trait loci (expression QTLs) that are associated with variations in the RNA splicing, i.e., sQTLs. To further the understanding of regulatory variants, sQTLs were compare with other two types of expression QTLs, 1) variants associated with variations in gene expression, i.e., geQTLs and 2) variants associated with variations in exon expression, i.e., eeQTLs, in different tissues.\n\nResultsUsing whole genome and RNA sequence data from four tissues of over 200 cattle, sQTLs identified using exon inclusion ratios were verified by matching their effects on adjacent intron excision ratios. sQTLs contained the highest percentage of variants that are within the intronic region of genes and contained the lowest percentage of variants that are within intergenic regions, compared to eeQTLs and geQTLs. Many geQTLs and sQTLs are also detected as eeQTLs. Many expression QTLs, including sQTLs, were significant in all four tissues and had a similar effect in each tissue. To verify such expression QTL sharing between tissues, variants surrounding ({+/-}1Mb) the exon or gene were used to build local genomic relationship matrices (LGRM) and estimated genetic correlations between tissues. For many exons, the splicing and expression level was determined by the same cis additive genetic variance in different tissues. Thus, an effective but simple-to-implement meta-analysis combining information from three tissues is introduced to increase power to detect and validate sQTLs. sQTLs and eeQTLs together were more enriched for variants associated with cattle complex traits, compared to geQTLs. Several putative causal mutations were identified, including an sQTL at Chr6:87392580 within the 5th exon of kappa casein (CSN3) associated with milk production traits.\n\nConclusionsUsing novel analytical approaches, we report the first identification of numerous bovine sQTLs which are extensively shared between multiple tissue types. The significant overlaps between bovine sQTLs and complex traits QTL highlight the contribution of regulatory mutations to phenotypic variations.","10.1186/s12864-018-4902-8"

Due to the stochasticity of single-molecule blinking and the desire to improve SMLMs temporal resolution, algorithms capable of analyzing frames with a high density (HD) of active molecules, or molecules whose images overlap, are a prerequisite for accurate location measurements. Thus far, HD algorithms are evaluated using scalar metrics, such as root-mean-square error, that fail to quantify the structure of errors caused by the structure of the sample. Here, we show that the spatial distribution of localization errors within super-resolved images of biological structures are vectorial in nature, leading to systematic structural biases that severely degrade image resolution. We further demonstrate that the shape of the microscopes point-spread function (PSF) fundamentally affects the characteristics of imaging artifacts. We built a Robust Statistical Estimation algorithm (RoSE) to minimize these biases for arbitrary structures and PSFs. RoSE accomplishes this minimization by estimating the likelihood of blinking events to localize molecules more accurately and eliminate false localizations. Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.","10.1038/s41598-018-31366-w"

Scats from a captive feeding trial (n=41) and from free-ranging individuals (n=326) were collected and analysed using a cytb mini-barcode in independent PCR duplicates on the Ion PGM and the MiSeq platforms. Outputs from MiSeq were more sensitive and reproducible than those from Ion PGM due to a higher sequencing depth and sequence quality on MiSeq. DNA from intact prey taxa was detected more often (82% of the expected occurrences) than DNA from pet food (54%) and raw fish and meat (31%). We assumed that this variability was linked to different degree of DNA degradation: The Ion PGM detected significantly less human-linked food, birds, field voles, murids and shrews in the field-collected samples than the MiSeq platform. Pooling the replicates from both platforms and filtering the data allowed identification of at least one food item in 87.4% of the field-collected samples.

Previous work demonstrated a probable role of posterior callosal dysfunction in the chronic persistence of neglect signs. Prism adaptation is a non-invasive and convenient technique to rehabilitate chronic visual neglect, but it is not effective in all patients. Here we aimed to assess the hypothesis that prism adaptation improves left neglect by facilitating compensation through the contribution of the left, undamaged hemisphere. We assessed the relationship between prism adaptation effects, cortical thickness and white matter integrity in a group of 14 patients with unilateral right-hemisphere strokes and chronic visual neglect. Results showed that patients who benefitted from prism adaptation had thicker cortex in temporo-parietal, prefrontal and cingulate areas of the left, undamaged hemisphere. Additionally, these patients had a higher fractional anisotropy value in the body and genu of the corpus callosum. Results from normal controls show that these callosal regions connect temporo-parietal, sensorimotor and prefrontal areas. Finally, shorter time intervals from the stroke tended to improve patients response to prism adaptation. We concluded that prism adaptation may improve left visual neglect by promoting the contribution of the left hemisphere to neglect compensation. These results support current hypotheses on the role of the healthy hemisphere in the compensation for stroke-induced, chronic neuropsychological deficits, and suggest that prism adaptation can foster this role by exploiting sensorimotor/prefrontal circuits, especially when applied at early stages post-stroke.","10.1016/j.cortex.2018.12.004"

Revealed by anaphase spindle rocking, these pulling forces are regulated by the force generator dynamics, which are in turn consequent of mitotic progression. We found a novel, additional, regulation of these forces by the spindle position. It controls astral microtubule availability at the cortex, on which the active force generators can pull. Importantly, this positional control relies on the polarity dependent LET-99 cortical band, which restricts or concentrates generators to a posterior crescent. After delaying anaphase onset, we detected this positional pulling force regulation in C. elegans as a precocious spindle rocking with respect to anaphase onset. We ascribed this control to the microtubule dynamics at the cortex. Indeed, in mapping the cortical contacts, we found a correlation between the centrosome-cortex distance and the microtubule contact density. In turn, it modulates pulling force generator activity. We modelled this control, predicting and experimentally validating that the posterior crescent extent controlled where the anaphase oscillations started, in addition to mitotic progression. We found in particular that the oscillation onset position resists changes in cellular geometry and moderate variations of active force generator count. Finally, we propose that spatially restricting force generator to a posterior crescent sets the spindles final position, reflecting polarity through the LET-99 dependent restriction of force generators to a posterior crescent. This regulation superimposes that of force generator processivity. This novel control confers a low dependence on microtubule and active force generator exact numbers or dynamics, provided that they exceed the threshold needed for posterior displacement. Interestingly, this robustness originates in cell mechanics rather than biochemical networks.","NA"

Tumors that overexpress MYC frequently demonstrate aneuploidy, numerical chromosome alterations associated with highly aggressive cancers, rapid tumor evolution, and poor patient outcome. While the role of MYC in overcoming the G1/S checkpoint is well established, it remains poorly understood whether MYC induces chromosomal instability (CIN). Here, we identify a direct influence of MYC on mitotic progression. MYC overexpression induces defects in microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly promoting chromosome segregation defects, micronuclei and CIN. We examined which mitotic regulators are required for the survival of MYC-overexpressing cells and found a reliance on high TPX2 expression. TPX2, a master microtubule regulator, is overexpressed together with MYC in multiple cell lines, in mouse tumor models and in aggressive human breast cancers. High TPX2 expression is permissive for mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation in cells with deregulated MYC, whereas TPX2 depletion blocks mitotic progression, induces cell death and prevents tumor growth. Importantly, attenuation of MYC expression reverses the mitotic defects observed, even in established tumor cell lines, implicating an ongoing role for high MYC in the persistence of a CIN phenotype in tumors. Here, we implicate the MYC oncogene as a regulator of spindle assembly and dynamics and identify a new MYC-TPX2 synthetic-lethal interaction that could represent a future therapeutic strategy in MYC-overexpressing cancers. Our studies suggest that blocking MYC activity can attenuate the emergence of CIN and tumor evolution.","NA"

The relevance of this membrane dynamics is underscored by the fact that mutations in Atlastins (ATL), the ER fusion proteins in mammals, cause neurodegeneration. How defects in this process disrupt neuronal homeostasis is largely unknown. Here we show by EM volume reconstruction of transfected cells, neurons and patient fibroblasts that the HSAN-causing ATL3 mutants promote aberrant ER tethering hallmarked by bundles of laterally attached ER tubules. In vitro, these mutants cause excessive liposome tethering, recapitulating the results in cells. Moreover, ATL3 variants retain their dimerization-dependent GTPase activity, but are unable to promote membrane fusion, suggesting a defect on an intermediate step of the ATL3 functional cycle. Our data therefore show that the effects of ATL3 mutations on ER network organization stretch beyond a loss of fusion, shedding a new light on neuropathies caused by atlastin defects.","10.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.071"

Massive, genome-wide transcriptomic rewiring in response to genomic merger and doubling has been demonstrated in many allopolyploid systems, encompassing a diversity of phenomena, including homoeolog expression bias, genome dominance, expression-level dominance, and revamping of co-expression networks. Here we present an analytical framework to reconcile these patterns of regulatory novelty as governed by distinct sets of intra- and inter-subgenome cis-trans relationships. This approach is a novel extension of classic allele-specific expression analysis to incorporate and distinguish the separate effects of parental regulatory interactions as well as further complications at the allopolyploid level. We demonstrated that the cis-trans framework devised not only offers new perspective on disentangling genetic from epigenetic and higher-order effects that impact gene expression, but also provides the conceptual basis and tools to unify recently presented models for both genome-wide expression dominance and biased fractionation in allopolyploids.","NA"

Assessments for variant classification now require orthogonal data searches, requiring aggregation of multiple lines of evidence from diverse resources. The burden of evidence for each variant to meet thresholds for pathogenicity or actionability now poses a growing challenge for those seeking to counsel patients and families following germline genetic testing. A computational algorithm that automates, provides uniformity and significantly accelerates this interpretive process is needed. The tool described here, Pathogenicity of Mutation Analyzer (PathoMAN) automates germline genomic variant curation from clinical sequencing based on ACMG guidelines. PathoMAN aggregates multiple tracks of genomic, protein and disease specific information from public sources. We compared expert manually curated variant data from studies on (i) prostate cancer (ii) breast cancer and (iii) ClinVar to assess performance. PathoMAN achieves high concordance (83.1% pathogenic, 75.5% benign) and negligible discordance (0.04% pathogenic, 0.9% benign) when contrasted against expert curation. Some loss of resolution (8.6% pathogenic, 23.64% benign) and gain of resolution (6.6% pathogenic, 1.6% benign) was also observed. We highlight the advantages and weaknesses related to the programmable automation of variant classification. We also propose a new nosology for the five ACMG classes to facilitate more accurate reporting to ClinVar. The proposed refinements will enhance utility of ClinVar to allow further automation in cancer genetics. PathoMAN will reduce the manual workload of domain level experts.

C.; Albert, R.","Jordan C Rozum","Pennsylvania State University","2018-04-05",2,"15","new results","systems biology","We present a technique applicable in any dynamical framework to identify control-robust subsets of an interacting system. These robust subsystems, which we call stable modules, are characterized by constraints on the variables that make up the subsystem. They are robust in the sense that if the defining constraints are satisfied at a given time, they remain satisfied for all later times, regardless of what happens in the rest of the system, and can only be broken if the constrained variables are externally manipulated. We identify stable modules as graph structures in an expanded network, which represents causal links between variable constraints. A stable module represents a system \""decision point\"", or trap subspace. Using the expanded network, small stable modules can be composed sequentially to form larger stable modules that describe dynamics on the system level. Collections of large, mutually exclusive stable modules describe the systems repertoire of long-term behaviors. We implement this technique in a broad class of dynamical systems and illustrate its practical utility via examples and algorithmic analysis of two published biological network models. In the segment polarity gene network of Drosophila melanogaster, we obtain a state-space visualization that reproduces by novel means the four possible cell fates and predicts the outcome of cell transplant experiments. In the T-cell signaling network, we identify six signaling elements that determine the high-signal response and show that control of an element connected to them cannot disrupt this response.\n\nAuthor summaryWe show how to uncover the causal relationships between qualitative statements about the values of variables in ODE systems. We then show how these relationships can be used to identify subsystem behaviors that are robust to outside interventions. This informs potential system control strategies (e.g., in identifying drug targets). Typical analytical properties of biomolecular systems render them particularly amenable to our techniques. Furthermore, due to their often high dimension and large uncertainties, our results are particularly useful in biomolecular systems. We apply our methods to two quantitative biological models: the segment polarity gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and the T-cell signal transduction network.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006630"

Range expansion could reduce further competitive ability while polyploidy could mitigate the effects of selfing. Although suggested by meta-analyses, these predictions have not been directly tested yet. We compared the competitive ability of four Capsella species differing by their mating system and ploidy level. We found that the two diploid selfing species (C. rubella and C. orientalis) were more sensitive to competition than the diploid outcrosser (C. grandiflora), and that the tetraploid selfer (C. bursa-pastoris) was intermediate. Within C. bursa-pastoris, we also found that sensitivity to competition increased in parallel to range expansion. These results highlight the possible roles of ecological context and ploidy in the evolutionary trajectories of selfing species.","NA"

One factor that could affect such time-dependent patterns is microbial interactions, wherein community composition at a given time point affects the microbial composition at a later time point. However, the field has not yet settled on the degree of this effect. Specifically, it has been recently suggested that only a minority of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) depend on the microbial composition in earlier times. To address the issue of identifying and predicting temporal microbial patterns we developed a new model, MTV-LMM (Microbial Temporal Variability Linear Mixed Model), a linear mixed model for the prediction of the microbial community temporal dynamics based on the community composition at previous time stamps. MTV-LMM can identify time-dependent microbes in time series datasets, which can then be used to analyze the trajectory of the microbiome over time. We evaluated the performance of MTV-LMM on three human microbiome time series datasets, and found that MTV-LMM significantly outperforms all existing methods for microbiome time series modeling. Particularly, we demonstrate that the effect of the microbial composition in previous time points on the abundance levels of an OTU at a later time point is underestimated by a factor of at least 10 when applying previous approaches. Using MTV-LMM, we demonstrate that a considerable proportion of the human gut microbiome, both in infants and adults, has a significant time-dependent component that can be predicted based on microbiome composition in earlier time points. This suggests that microbiome composition at a given time point is a major factor in defining future microbiome composition and that this phenomenon is considerably more common than previously reported for the human gut microbiome.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006960"

The proposed \""Equitable Thresholding and Clustering\"" (ETAC) approach seeks to reduce the dependence of clustering results on arbitrary parameter values by using multiple sub-tests, each equivalent to a standard FMRI clustering analysis, to make decisions about which groups of voxels are potentially significant. The union of these sub-test results decides which voxels are accepted. The approach adjusts the cluster-thresholding parameter of each sub-test in an equitable way, so that the individual false positive rates (FPRs) are balanced across sub-tests to achieve a desired final FPR (e.g., 5%). ETAC utilizes resampling methods to estimate the FPR, and thus does not rely on parametric assumptions about the spatial correlation of FMRI noise. The approach was validated with pseudo-task timings in resting state brain data. Additionally, a task FMRI data collection was used to compare ETACs true positive detection power vs. a standard cluster detection method, demonstrating that ETAC is able to detect true results and control false positives while reducing reliance on arbitrary analysis parameters.","10.1089/brain.2019.0666"

For example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk is activated by its kinase Mek by two consecutive phosphorylations within its activation loop. In this article, we use kinetic models to study how the activation of Erk is coupled to its abundance. Intuitively, Erk activity should rise with increasing amounts of Erk protein. However, a mathematical model shows that the signaling off-state is robust to increasing amounts of Erk, and Erk activity may even decline with increasing amounts of Erk. This counter-intuitive, bell-shaped response of Erk activity to increasing amounts of Erk arises from the competition of the unmodified and single phosphorylated form of Erk for access to its kinase Mek. This shows that phosphorylation cycles can contain an intrinsic robustness mechanism that protects signaling from aberrant activation e.g. by gene expression noise or kinase overexpression following gene duplication events in diseases like cancer.","10.1016/j.bpj.2018.08.019"

Enhanced MEST expression is significantly associated with pathogenesis of breast cancer patients. Also, MEST induces metastatic potential of breast cancer through induction of the EMT-TFs-mediated EMT program. Moreover, MEST leads to Twist-1 induction by STAT3 activation and subsequently enables the induction of activation of the EMT program via the induction of STAT3 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, the c-terminal region of MEST was essential for STAT3 activation via the induction of JAK2/STAT3 complex formation. Finally, MEST significantly increases the breast cancers ability to metastasize from the mammary gland to the lung. These observations suggest that MEST is a promising target for intervention to prevent tumor metastasis.","NA"

Therefore, we set out to look for impaired use of distal cues for spatial orientation in a mouse model of amyloidosis (3xTg-AD). To do this, we trained mice to shuttle to the end of a track and back to an enclosed start box to receive a water reward. Then, mice were trained to stop in an unmarked reward zone to receive a brain stimulation reward. The time required to remain in the zone for a reward was increased across training, and the track was positioned in a random start location for each trial. We found that 6-month female, but not male, 3xTg-AD mice were impaired. Male and female mice had only intracellular pathology and male mice had less pathology, particularly in the dorsal hippocampus.

In this task participants detected timbral changes in a target sound while ignoring those in a simultaneously presented masker. When the visual stimulus was temporally coherent with the target sound, performance was significantly better than when it was temporally coherent with the masker sound, despite the visual stimulus conveying no task-relevant information. Here, we trained observers to detect audiovisual temporal coherence and asked whether this improved their ability to benefit from visual cues during the auditory selective attention task. We observed these listeners improved performance in the auditory selective attention task and changed the way in which they benefited from a visual stimulus: after training performance was better when the visual stimulus was temporally coherent with either the target or the masker stream, relative to the condition in which the visual stimulus was coherent with neither auditory stream. A second group which trained to discriminate modulation rate differences between temporally coherent audiovisual streams improved task performance, but did not change the way in which they used visual information.

Despite their contrasting cognitive profiles, the learning profiles for the latter two groups did not differ: both were around 1 SD below age-expected levels on all learning measures.

The efficiency of the aggregation process depends on the membrane composition, being highest for a negatively charged bilayer. Furthermore, assembled aggregates can dissociate from the surface, suggesting that on-surface aggregation can be a mechanism by which pathological aggregates are produced. Computational modeling revealed that interaction of -syn with bilayer surface changes the protein conformation and its affinity to assemble into dimers, and these properties depend on the bilayer composition.

A prominent example is somite size which varies widely both within an individual and across species. Despite intense study of the segmentation clock governing the timing of somite generation, how it relates to somite size is poorly understood. Here we examine somite scaling and find that somite size at specification scales with the length of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) despite considerable variation in PSM length across developmental stages and in surgically size-reduced embryos. Measurement of clock period, axis elongation speed, and clock gene expression patterns demonstrate that existing models fail to explain scaling. We posit a \""clock and scaled gradient\"" model, in which somite boundaries are set by a dynamically scaling signaling gradient across the PSM. Our model not only explains existing data, but also makes a unique prediction that we experimentally confirm--the formation of periodic \""echoes\"" in somite size following perturbation of the size of one somite. Our findings demonstrate that gradient scaling plays a central role both in progression and size control of somitogenesis.\n\nSummary statementBy comparing patterning in zebrafish embryos of different size we show that a dynamically scaling gradient in the presomitic mesoderm regulates somite size control.","10.1242/dev.161257"

Nonetheless, these individuals have chronic inflammation associated with heightened risk of cardiovascular pathology. HIV-1 establishes proviruses in long-lived CD4+ memory T cells, and perhaps other cell types, that preclude elimination of the virus even after years of continuous antiviral therapy. Though the majority of proviruses that persist during antiviral therapy are defective for production of infectious virions, many are expressed, raising the possibility that the HIV-1provirus or its transcripts contribute to ongoing inflammation. Here we found that the HIV-1 provirus activated innate immune signaling in isolated dendritic cells, macrophages, and CD4+ T cells. Immune activation required transcription from the HIV-1 provirus and expression of CRM1-dependent, Rev-dependent, RRE-containing, unspliced HIV-1 RNA. If rev was provided in trans, all HIV-1 coding sequences were dispensable for activation except those cis-acting sequences required for replication or splicing. These results indicate that the complex, post-transcriptional regulation intrinsic to HIV-1 RNA is detected by the innate immune system as a danger signal, and that drugs which disrupt HIV-1 transcription or HIV-1 RNA metabolism would add qualitative benefit to current antiviral drug regimens.","10.1038/s41467-018-07753-2"

Here, we measure the detachment rate of single molecules of human {beta}-cardiac myosin and its load dependence. We find that both can be modulated by both small molecule compounds and cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. Furthermore, effects of mutations can be reversed by introducing appropriate compounds. Our results suggest that activating vs. inhibitory perturbations of cardiac myosin are discriminated by the aggregate result on duty ratio, average force, and ultimately average power output and that cardiac contractility can be controlled by tuning the load-dependent kinetics of single myosin molecules.","10.1038/s41594-018-0069-x"

Here, we report the effect of the CCI on surrogate scores of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver fibrosis.

MethodsThis was a non-randomized longitudinal study, including adults with T2D who were self-enrolled to the CCI (n=262) or to receive usual care (UC, n=87) during one year. A NAFLD liver fat score [N-LFS] > -0.640 defined the presence of fatty liver. A NAFLD fibrosis score [NFS] of > 0.675 identified subjects with advanced fibrosis. Changes in N-LFS and NFS at one year were the main endpoints.

ResultsAt baseline, NAFLD was present in 95% of patients in the CCI and 90% of patients in the UC. At one year, weight loss of > 5% was achieved in 79% of patients in the CCI vs. 19% of patients in UC (P<0.001). N-LFS mean score was reduced in the CCI group (-1.95{+/-}0.22, P<0.001) whereas it was not changed in the UC (0.47{+/-}0.41, P=0.26) (CCI vs. UC, P<0.001). NFS was reduced in the CCI group (-0.65{+/-}0.06, P<0.001) compared with UC (0.26{+/-}0.11, P=0.02) (P<0.001 between two groups). In the CCI group, the percentage of individuals with a low probability of advanced fibrosis increased from 18% at baseline to 33% at 1 year (P<0.001).

ConclusionsOne year of a digitally-supported CCI significantly improved surrogates of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Data on vaccine uptake and prevalence of colonization with PCV-targeted serotypes were obtained from a unique study conducted among children visiting an emergency department in southern Israel and from surveys of colonization from central Israel. Data on invasive pneumococcal disease in adults were obtained from a nationwide surveillance study. We compared the trajectory of decline of IPD due to PCV-targeted serotypes in adults with the trajectory of decline of colonization prevalence and trajectory of increase in vaccine-derived protection against pneumococcal carriage among different age groupings of children. The declines in IPD in adults were most closely associated with the declines in colonization and increased vaccination coverage in children in the range of 36-59 months of age.

Sackton","Informatics Group, Harvard University, USA","2018-04-05",2,"15","new results","evolutionary biology","Standard models of sex chromosome evolution propose that recombination suppression leads to the degeneration of the heterogametic chromosome, as is seen for the Y chromosome in mammals and the W chromosome in most birds. Unlike other birds, paleognaths (ratites and tinamous) possess large non-degenerate regions on their sex chromosomes (PARs or pseudoautosomal regions). It remains unclear why these large PARs are retained over more than 100 MY, and how this retention impacts the evolution of sex chromosomes within this system. To address this puzzle, we analysed Z chromosome evolution and gene expression across 12 paleognaths, several of whose genomes have recently been sequenced. We confirm at the genomic level that most paleognaths retain large PARs. As in other birds, we find that all paleognaths have incomplete dosage compensation on the regions of the Z chromosome homologous to degenerated portions of the W (differentiated regions or DRs), but we find no evidence for enrichments of male-biased genes in PARs. We find limited evidence for increased evolutionary rates (faster-Z) either across the chromosome or in DRs for most paleognaths with large PARs, but do recover signals of faster-Z evolution in tinamou species with mostly degenerated W chromosomes, similar to the pattern seen in neognaths. Unexpectedly, in some species PAR-linked genes evolve faster on average than genes on autosomes, suggested by diverse genomic features to be due to reduced efficacy of selection in paleognath PARs. Our analysis shows that paleognath Z chromosomes are atypical at the genomic level, but the evolutionary forces maintaining largely homomorphic sex chromosomes in these species remain elusive.","10.1093/gbe/evz154"

Germ line inactivating alterations in Fumarate Hydratase (FH) cause HLRCC, and result in elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent work indicates that FH -/-PRCC cells have increased ABL1 activation, which promotes tumor growth, but how ABL1 is activated remained unclear. Oxidation can regulate protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) catalytic activity; conceivably, ROS-catalyzed inactivation of an ABL-directed PTP might account for ABL1 activation in this malignancy. Previously, our group developed \""q-oxPTPome,\"" a method that can globally monitor the oxidation of classical PTPs. We have now refined the q-oxPTPome approach, increasing its sensitivity by >10X. Applying q-oxPTPome to FH-deficient cell models shows that multiple PTPs are either highly oxidized (including PTPN12) or overexpressed. In general, highly oxidized PTPs were those that have relatively high sensitivity to exogenous H2O2. Most PTP oxidation in FH-deficient cells is reversible, although nearly 40% of PTPN13 is oxidized irreversibly to the sulfonic acid state. Using \""substrate-trapping mutants\"", we mapped PTPs to their putative substrates, and found that only PTPN12 could target ABL1. Furthermore, knockdown experiments identify PTPN12 as the major ABL1 phosphatase in HLRCC. Overall, our results show that ROS-induced PTPN12 oxidation accounts for ABL1 phosphorylation in HLRCC-associated PRCC, reveal a novel mechanism for inactivating a tumor suppressor gene product, and establish a direct link between pathological PTP oxidation and neoplastic disease.","NA"

Here we showed that SHOC2 is a novel substrate of FBXW7. Upon phosphorylation on Thr507 by ATR, SHOC2 is recognized by FBXW7 for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. Consistently, SHOC2-induced RAS/ERK activation and cell growth are inhibited by FBXW7. Furthermore, SHOC2 selectively binds to Raptor to competitively inhibit the Raptor-mTOR binding to inactivate mTORC1 and induce autophagy, whereas Raptor binding of SHOC2 inhibits the SHOC2-RAS binding to block MAPK pathway and proliferation. Finally, SHOC2 is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer, which correlated with poor patient survival, and multiple SHOC2 mutations were found in human lung cancer tissues with the gain-of-function activity.

Presented here are two engineered bacterial biosensors for the detection and quantification of silver. The biosensors contain a silver resistance operon and a GFP gene that is strictly regulated through silver activated regulatory regions that control expression of the sil operons. The two biosensors are responsive to a wide range of silver ion concentrations, and a correlation between silver and GFP signal is seen at select concentration ranges. The biosensors were shown to detect silver ions released from silver nanoparticles, and have the potential to become a method for monitoring ion release rates of different nanoparticles. Interestingly, the close homology of the silver resistance and copper resistance genes allowed for the biosensor to also be responsive to copper ions, implying that copper ions activate silver resistance. Further development of this biosensor could lead to commercial applications for environmental monitoring.\n\nImportanceIonic silver is known to have many harmful environmental effects. Silver pollutants have been found in various environmental settings such as natural waterways and tailings from mining operations, raising concern. In addition, persistent exposure to silver in medical and environmental settings has led to the development of silver resistant bacteria, many of which are also resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. Some of these have the potential to develop into human pathogens. It then becomes important to have standardized methods for detecting and monitoring silver concentrations in various environments so that appropriate measures can be taken to prevent further silver ion release. This research shows that bacterial biosensors engineered to detect and quantify silver ions can be developed as effective alternatives to traditional analytical techniques. Further development of such biosensors could result in a commercial system for short and long term environmental monitoring, which is important as products containing silver and other heavy metals become increasingly popular.","NA"

We describe the development and characterisation of an aggressive brain metastatic variant of the 4T1 syngeneic model (4T1Br4) that spontaneously metastasises to multiple organs, but is selectively more metastatic to the brain from the mammary gland than parental 4T1 tumours. By immunohistochemistry, 4T1Br4 tumours and brain metastases display a triple negative phenotype, consistent with the high propensity of this breast cancer subtype to spread to brain. In vitro assays indicate that 4T1Br4 cells have an enhanced ability to adhere to or migrate across a brain-derived endothelial monolayer and greater invasive response to brain-derived soluble factors compared to 4T1 cells. These properties are likely to contribute to the brain-selectivity of 4T1Br4 tumours. Expression profiling and gene set enrichment analyses demonstrate the clinical relevance of the 4T1Br4 model at the transcriptomic level. Pathway analyses implicate tumour-intrinsic immune regulation and vascular interactions in successful brain colonisation, revealing potential therapeutic targets. Evaluation of two histone deacetylase inhibitors, SB939 and 1179.4b, shows partial efficacy against 4T1Br4 metastasis to brain and other sites in vivo and potent radio-sensitising properties in vitro.

To address these challenges, we aimed to develop a fully defined liver organoid platform using inverted colloid crystal (ICC) whose 3-dimensional mechanical properties could be engineered to recapitulate the extracellular niche sensed by hepatic progenitors during human development. iPSC derived hepatic progenitors (IH) formed organoids most optimally in ICC scaffolds constructed with 140 {micro}m diameter pores coated with Collagen in a two-step process mimicking liver bud formation.

The fusion of the nascent Golgi membranes is mediated by the cross-membrane interaction of Rab6a GTPase and giantin.

Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.","10.7554/eLife.37663"

Synaptobrevin-2 a SNARE protein, participates in this process through its interaction with other SNARE and associate proteins. Synaptobrevin-2 transmembrane domain is embedded into the vesicle lipid bilayer except for its last three residues. These residues are hydrophilic and constitute synaptobrevin-2 C-terminal flexible region. This region interacts with the intravesicular lipid bilayer phosphate head groups to initiate the fusion pore formation. Here it is shown that, this region also modulates the intravesicular membrane potential thereby the discharged of catecholamine. Synapotobrevin-2 Y113 residue was mutated to lysine or glutamate. The effects of these mutations on the exocytotic process in chromaffin cells were assessed using capacitance measurements, combined with amperometry and stimulation by flash photolysis of caged Ca2+. Both Y113E and Y113K mutations reduced the amplitudes of vesicle fusions and reduced the rates of release of catecholamine molecules in quanta release events. Further investigation revealed that the proximity of these charged residues near the vesicle lipid bilayer most likely changed the intravesicular potential, thereby slowing the flux of ions through the fusion pore, hence reducing the rate of catecholamine secretion. These results suggest that catecholamine efflux is couple with the intravesicular membrane potential.","10.1016/j.bpj.2019.01.028"

RNA sequencing reveals that mesenchyme cells terminate growth by an intrinsic cell cycle timer in the presence of e-m signalling. In this process, e-m signalling is required permissively to allow the intrinsic cell cycle timer to run its course.

We hypothesized that the well-documented reduced heat tolerance of cold-reared Daphnia is due to the accumulation of PUFA in their body tissues and that heat-reared Daphnia contain reduced amounts of PUFA even when receiving a high dietary supply of PUFA. In Daphnia reared at 15{degrees}C, supplementation of a PUFA-deficient food with the long-chain PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of EPA in body tissues and a decrease in heat tolerance. However, the same was observed in Daphnia reared at 25{degrees}C, indicating that the ability of heat-acclimated Daphnia to adjust EPA body concentrations is limited when exposed to high dietary EPA concentrations. Daphnia reared at 25{degrees}C showed the lowest change in membrane fluidity, measured as fluorescence polarization. For Daphnia reared at three different temperatures, thermal tolerance (time to immobility at a lethally high temperature) and increasing dietary EPA concentrations correlated with fluorescence polarization and the degree of fatty acid unsaturation. Overall, our results support the homeoviscous adaptation hypothesis by showing that cold-reared Daphnia, which accumulate PUFA within their tissues, are more susceptible to heat than hot-reared Daphnia, which contain less PUFA.","NA"

The influence of the type of ecological dynamics on the dynamics of the larger socio-ecological system is less well studied, however. Here, we carry out such a comparison using a mathematical model of a common pool resource problem. A population must make decisions about harvesting a renewable resource. Individuals may either be cooperators, who harvest at a sustainable level, or defectors, who over-harvest. Cooperators punish defectors through social ostracism. Individuals can switch strategies according the costs and benefits of harvesting and the strength of social ostracism. These mechanisms are represented by a differential equation for social dynamics which is coupled to three different types of resource dynamics: logistic growth, constant inflow, and threshold growth. We find that when human influence is sufficiently weak, the form of natural dynamics leaves a strong imprint on the socio-ecological dynamics, and human social dynamics are qualitatively very different from natural dynamics. However, stronger human influence introduces a broad intermediate parameter regime where dynamical patterns converge to a common type: the three types of ecological systems exhibit similar dynamics, but also, social and ecological dynamics strongly mirror one another. This is a consequence of stronger coupling and is reminiscent of synchrony from other fields, such as the classic problem of coupled oscillators in physics. Socio-ecological convergence has implications for how we understand and manage complex socio-ecological systems. In an era of growing human influence on ecological systems, further empirical and theoretical work is required to determine whether socio-ecological convergence is present in real systems.","10.1007/s12080-018-0394-z"

Formation of the VS, a transient multiform adhesion structure, is mediated through an interaction between the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) and the viral receptor CD4 on the surface of infected cell and target cell, respectively. Given that Env, unlike many other viral fusogens, can mediate the merger of membranes at neutral pH, the close encounter of infected and uninfected cells would seem prone to result in cell-cell fusion and thus the formation of syncytia. However, while it is being recognized now that small, T cell-based syncytia are indeed a defining feature of the natural history of HIV-1, the majority of VSs nevertheless resolve without fusion, thus securing continued virus spread. Gag, the main viral structural component, is partially responsible for restraining Env and preventing it from becoming fusogenic before being incorporated into particles. In addition, a few cellular factors, including tetraspanins and ezrin, have also been shown to inhibit Envs activity while this fusogen is still part of the producer cell.

Here, we identify EWI-2, a protein that was previously shown to associate with the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 and also with ezrin, as a host factor that contributes to the inhibition of Env{-}mediated cell-cell fusion. Using fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and TZM-bl fusion assays, we show that EWI-2, comparable to tetraspanins, while overall being downregulated upon HIV-1 infection, accumulates at the producer cell side of the VS (i.e. the presynapse), where it contributes to the fusion-preventing activities of the other viral and cellular components.","10.3390/v11121082"

When considering the mammalian genome it is important to take into account that about half of the DNA is comprised of transposable elements. Given their repetitive nature, reads associated with these elements are generally discarded or randomly distributed among elements of the same type in genome-wide analyses. Thus, it is challenging to identify the activities and properties of individual transposons. As a result, we only have a partial understanding of how transposons contribute to chromatin folding and how they impact gene regulation.\n\nResultsUsing adapted PCR and Capture-based chromosome conformation capture (3C) approaches, collectively called 4Tran, we take advantage of the repetitive nature of transposons to capture interactions from multiple copies of endogenous retrovirus (ERVs) in the human and mouse genomes. With 4Tran-PCR, reads are selectively mapped to unique regions in the genome. This enables the identification of TE interaction profiles for individual ERV families and integration events specific to particular genomes. With this approach we demonstrate that transposons engage in long-range intra-chromosomal interactions guided by the separation of chromosomes into A and B compartments as well as topologically associated domains (TADs). In contrast to 4Tran-PCR, Capture-4Tran can uniquely identify both ends of an interaction that involve retroviral repeat sequences, providing a powerful tool for uncovering the individual TE insertions that interact with, and potentially regulate target genes.\n\nConclusions4Tran provides new insight into the manner in which transposons contribute to chromosome architecture and identifies target genes that transposable elements can potentially control.","NA"

Just 15% of amino acids found in yeast His3 orthologues were always neutral while the impact on fitness of the remaining 85% depended on the genetic background. Furthermore, at 67% of sites, substitutions are under sign epistasis, having both strongly positive and negative effect in different genetic backgrounds. 46% of sites were under reciprocal sign epistasis.

This may compromise the validity of numerous genomic assays, especially for single-cell studies where many samples are routinely multiplexed together. The severity and consequences of barcode swapping for single-cell transcriptomic studies remain poorly understood. We have used two statistical approaches to robustly quantify the fraction of swapped reads in each of two plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We found that approximately 2.5% of reads were mislabeled between samples on the HiSeq 4000 machine, which is lower than previous reports. We observed no correlation between the swapped fraction of reads and the concentration of free barcode across plates. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that barcode swapping may generate complex but artefactual cell libraries in droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing studies. To eliminate these artefacts, we have developed an algorithm to exclude individual molecules that have swapped between samples in 10X Genomics experiments, exploiting the combinatorial complexity present in the data. This permits the continued use of cutting-edge sequencing machines for droplet-based experiments while avoiding the confounding effects of barcode swapping.","10.1038/s41467-018-05083-x"

Benzoxaborole-based compounds are very promising potential novel anti-trypanosomal therapies, with candidates already in human and animal clinical trials. Their targets in trypanosomes were hitherto unknown. We investigated the mechanism of action of several benzoxaboroles, including AN7973, an early candidate for veterinary trypanosomosis.\n\nIn all kinetoplastids, transcription is polycistronic. Individual mRNA 5-ends are created by trans splicing of a short leader sequence, with coupled polyadenylation of the preceding mRNA. Treatment of Trypanosoma brucei with AN7973 inhibited trans splicing within 1h, as judged by loss of the Y-structure splicing intermediate and reduced levels of mRNA, and accumulation of peri-nuclear granules which are typical for splicing inhibition. Methylation of the spliced leader precursor RNA was not affected, but more prolonged AN7973 treatment caused an increase in S-adenosyl methionine and methylated lysine. Together, these results indicate that mRNA processing is the primary target of AN7973. Polyadenylation is required for kinetoplastid trans splicing. The EC50 for AN7973 in T. brucei was increased three-fold by over-expression of the T. brucei cleavage and polyadenylation factor CPSF3, identifying CPSF3 as a potential molecular target. Our results thus chemically validate mRNA processing as a viable drug target in trypanosomes.\n\nSeveral other benzoxaboroles showed metabolomic and splicing effects that were similar to those of AN7973, identifying splicing inhibition as a common mode of action, and suggesting that it might be linked to subsequent changes in methylated metabolites. Granule formation, splicing inhibition, and resistance after CPSF3 expression did not, however, always correlate, and prolonged selection of trypanosomes in AN7973 resulted in only 1.5-fold resistance. This suggests that the modes of action of oxaboroles that target trypanosome mRNA processing may extend beyond CPSF3 inhibition.\n\nAuthor summaryTrypanosomes and leishmanias infect millions of humans and cause economically devastating diseases of livestock; the few existing drugs have serious deficiencies. Trypanosomosis of cattle, caused mainly by Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax, is a serious problem in Africa, because bovids are used not only for meat and milk, but also for traction. Only two drugs are in routine use for chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis of bovine trypanosomosis. A single injection of the benzoxaborole compound AN7973 was sufficient to cure T. congolense infection in cattle and goats, but AN7973 was less effective against T. vivax. This precluded development of AN7973 as a commercially viable treatment against cattle trypanosomosis, but it could still have potential for diseases caused by other salivarian trypanosomes.\n\nWe used a large range of methods to find out how AN7973 kills trypanosomes, and compared it with several other benzoxaboroles. AN7973 and some of the other compounds had effects on parasite metabolism that resembled those previously seen for a benzoxaborole that is being tested for human sleeping sickness. The most rapid effect of AN7973, however, was on processing of trypanosome mRNA. As a consequence, amounts of mRNA decreased and synthesis of proteins stopped. We conclude that AN7973 and some other benzoxaboroles kill trypanosomes by stopping gene expression.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007315"

A.; Hagen, S. J.","Stephen J Hagen","University of Florida, Physics Department","2018-04-06",2,"15","new results","microbiology","AbstractEntry into genetic competence in streptococci is controlled by ComX, an alternative sigma factor for genes that enable the import of exogenous DNA. In Streptococcus mutans, the immediate activator of comX is the ComRS signaling system, which consists of the cytosolic receptor ComR and the 7-residue signal peptide XIP, which is derived from ComS. Extracellular XIP imported by an oligopeptide permease interacts with ComR to form a transcriptional activator for both comX and comS. Therefore, extracellular XIP can function as an exogenous signal to trigger S. mutans competence. However, the mechanisms that process ComS and export it as XIP are not fully known in S. mutans. The observation that comX is expressed bimodally under some environmental conditions suggests that ComR may also interact with endogenously produced XIP or ComS, creating an intracellular positive feedback loop in comS transcription. Here we use single cell and microfluidic methods to compare the effects of the native comS gene and extracellular XIP on comX expression. We find that deletion of comS reduces the response of comX to extracellular XIP. We also find that comS-overexpressing cells autoactivate their comX even when their growth medium is rapidly exchanged, although this autoactivation requires an intact copy of comS under control of its own promoter. However comS-overexpressing cells do not activate comS-deficient mutants growing in coculture. These data show that individual cells can activate comX without exporting or importing the XIP or ComS signal, and that endogenously and exogenously produced ComS/XIP have inequivalent effects on comX behavior. These data are fully consistent with a model in which intracellular positive feedback in comS transcription plays a role in ComRS signaling, and is responsible for the bimodal expression of comX.\n\nAuthor SummaryHeterogeneous gene expression in genetically identical populations plays an important role in bacterial persistence and survival under changing environmental conditions. In the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans, the physiological state of genetic competence can exhibit bimodality, with only some cells becoming competent. S. mutans controls its entry into competence by using the ComRS signaling system to activate comX, a gene encoding the master competence regulator ComX. The ComRS system is understood as a quorum sensing system, in which the extracellular accumulation of the small signal peptide XIP, derived from ComS, induces comX expression. We coupled observation of bacteria that fluoresce when comX is active with mathematical analysis and chemical binding assays to show that activation of comX does not necessarily require extracellular XIP or ComS, and that comX-active cells do not necessarily export XIP. Our experiments and mathematical modeling indicate that a positive feedback loop in comS transcription allows a cell to activate comX in response to its own XIP or ComS in the absence of extracellular XIP, or to amplify its comX response to extracellular XIP if present. Such positive feedback loops are often the cause of bimodal gene expression like that seen in S. mutans competence.","10.1128/mSphere.00444-18"

We collect demographics, life history, medical history, genealogy, neuropsychological data and blood samples. Centenarians are followed annually until death. PET-MRI scans and feces donation are optional. Almost 30% of the centenarians agreed to post-mortem brain donation.\n\nCOHORT DESCRIPTIONTo date (September 2018), 332 centenarians were included in the study. We analyzed demographic statistics of the first 300 centenarians (25% males) included in the cohort. Centenarians came from higher socio-economic classes and had higher levels of education compared to their birth cohort; alcohol consumption of centenarians was similar, and most males smoked during their lifetime. At baseline, the centenarians had a median MMSE score of 25 points (IQR: 22.0-27.5); the large majority lived independently, retained hearing and vision abilities and was independently mobile. Mortality was associated with cognitive functioning: centenarians with a baseline MMSE score [&ge;]26 and <26 points had a mortality percentage of respectively 17% and 42% per annual year in the second year after baseline (p=0.003). The cohort was 2.1-fold enriched with the neuroprotective APOE-{varepsilon}2 allele relative to 60-80 year-old population controls (p=4.8x10-7), APOE-{varepsilon}3 was unchanged and the APOE-{varepsilon}4 allele was 2.3-fold depleted (p=6.3x10-7).\n\nCONCLUSIONSComprehensive characterization of the 100-plus cohort of cognitively healthy centenarians might reveal protective factors that explain the physiology of long-term preserved cognitive health.","10.1007/s10654-018-0451-3"

Behavioral and brain-imaging studies robustly show that higher intelligence associates with faster reaction times and thicker gray matter in temporal and frontal cortical areas. However, no direct evidence exists that links individual neuron activity and structure to human intelligence. Since a large part of cortical grey matter consists of dendrites, these structures likely determine cortical architecture. In addition, dendrites strongly affect functional properties of neurons, including action potential speed. Thereby, dendritic size and action potential firing may constitute variation in cortical thickness, processing speed, and ultimately IQ.\n\nTo investigate this, we took advantage of brain tissue available from neurosurgery and recorded from pyramidal neurons in the medial temporal cortex, an area showing high association between cortical thickness, cortical activity and intelligence. Next, we reconstructed full dendritic structures of recorded neurons and combined these with brain-imaging data and IQ scores from the same subjects. We find that high IQ scores and large temporal cortical thickness associate with larger, more complex dendrites of human pyramidal neurons. We show in silico that larger dendrites enable pyramidal neurons to track activity of synaptic inputs with higher temporal precision, due to fast action potential initiation. Finally, we find that human pyramidal neurons of individuals with higher IQ scores sustain faster action potentials during repeated firing. These findings provide first evidence that human intelligence is associated with neuronal complexity, action potential speed and efficient information transfer in cortical neurons.","10.7554/elife.41714"

Novel therapies are greatly needed for these diseases. One appealing antiangiogenic target is reduction-oxidation factor 1-apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (Ref-1/APE1). This protein can act as a redox-sensitive transcriptional activator for NF-{kappa}B and other pro-angiogenic transcription factors. An existing inhibitor of Ref-1s function, APX3330, previously showed antiangiogenic effects. Here, we developed improved APX3330 derivatives and assessed their antiangiogenic activity. We synthesized APX2009 and APX2014 and demonstrated enhanced inhibition of Ref-1 function in a DNA-binding assay compared to APX3330. Both compounds were antiproliferative against human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs; GI50 APX2009: 1.1 M, APX2014: 110 nM) and macaque choroidal endothelial cells (Rf/6a GI50 APX2009: 26 M, APX2014: 5.0 M). Both compounds significantly reduced the ability of HRECs and Rf/6a cells to form tubes at mid nanomolar concentrations compared to control, and both significantly inhibited HREC and Rf/6a cell migration in a scratch wound assay, reducing NF-{kappa}B activation and downstream targets. Ex vivo, both APX2009 and APX2014 inhibited choroidal sprouting at low micromolar and high nanomolar concentrations respectively. In the laser-induced choroidal neovascularization mouse model, intraperitoneal APX2009 treatment significantly decreased lesion volume by 4-fold compared to vehicle (p < 0.0001, ANOVA with Dunnetts post hoc tests), without obvious intraocular or systemic toxicity. Thus, Ref-1 inhibition with APX2009 and APX2014 blocks ocular angiogenesis in vitro and ex vivo, and APX2009 is an effective systemic therapy for CNV in vivo, establishing Ref-1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach for ocular neovascularization.","10.1124/jpet.118.248088"

We performed integrative multi-omics analyses by combining data from the fungal genome, transcriptomes, and secretomes. We found the fungus possessed an unexpectedly large set of genes coding for enzymes related to lignin degradation, and that these were highly expressed and massively secreted under solid-state fermentation conditions. The examination of interrelated multi-omics patterns revealed the coordinated regulation of lignin-active peroxidases and H2O2-generating enzymes along with the activation of cellular mechanisms for detoxification, which combined to result in the efficient lignin breakdown by the fungus.\n\nImportancePlant biomass conversion for green chemistry and bio-energy is a current challenge for a modern sustainable bioeconomy. The complex polyaromatic lignin polymers in raw biomass feedstocks (i.e. agriculture and forestry by-products) are major obstacles for biomass conversions. From a biotechnological aspect, these compounds could be a potential source of aromatic platform molecules for bio-based polymers. Here we describe the extraordinary ability of Polyporus brumalis for lignin degradation using its enzymatic arsenal to break down wheat straw, a lignocellulosic substrate that is considered as a biomass feedstock worldwide. We observed unusual expansions of gene families coding for; 1) Class II peroxidases involved in lignin degradation; and 2) GMC oxidoreductases/dehydrogenases involved in generating the hydrogen peroxide required for lignin peroxidase activity.

In mammalian cells, mitochondria are transported predominantly along microtubules by kinesin and dynein and along actin filaments by myosin. Myosin XIX (Myo19) associates with the outer mitochondrial membrane, but no specific receptor has been identified. Using proximity BioID labeling, we identified Miro-1 and Miro-2 as potential binding partners of Myo19. Interaction studies show that Miro-1 binds to a C-terminal fragment of the Myo19 tail region and that Miro recruits the Myo19 tail in vivo. This recruitment is regulated by the nucleotide-state of the N-terminal Rho-like GTPase domain of Miro. Notably, Myo19 protein stability in cells depends on its association with Miro. Finally, Myo19 regulates the subcellular distribution of mitochondria. Downregulation, as well as overexpression, of Myo19 induces perinuclear collapse of mitochondria, phenocopying the loss of kinesin KIF5 or its mitochondrial receptor Miro.

In order to address the mechanisms underlying this deficiency, we established Caenorhabditis elegans as a metazoan model organism to study purine metabolism, while focusing on ADSL. We show that the purine biosynthesis network is functionally conserved in C. elegans. Moreover, ADSL is required for developmental timing and germline stem cell maintenance, and muscle integrity.

The criteria for accepting or rejecting donor kidneys relies heavily on pathologist determination of the percent of glomeruli (determined from a frozen section) that are normal and sclerotic. This percentage is a critical measurement that correlates with transplant outcome. Inter- and intra-observer variability in donor biopsy evaluation is, however, significant. An automated method for determination of percent global glomerulosclerosis could prove useful in decreasing evaluation variability, increasing throughput, and easing the burden on pathologists. Here, we describe the development of a deep learning model that identifies and classifies non-sclerosed and sclerosed glomeruli in whole-slide images of donor kidney frozen section biopsies. This model extends a convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on a large database of digital images. The extended model, when trained on just 48 whole slide images, exhibits slide-level evaluation performance on par with expert renal pathologists. The model substantially outperforms a model trained on image patches of isolated glomeruli. Encouragingly, the models performance is robust to slide preparation artifacts associated with frozen section preparation. As the first model reported that identifies and classifies normal and sclerotic glomeruli in frozen kidney sections, and thus the first model reported in the literature relevant to kidney transplantation, it may become an essential part of donor kidney biopsy evaluation in the clinical setting.","10.1109/TMI.2018.2851150"

Recently, it was shown that high expression levels of SAMHD1 are also correlated with significantly worse patient responses to nucleotide analogue drugs important for treating a variety of cancers, including Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). In this study, we used biochemical, structural, and cellular methods to examine the interactions of various cancer drugs with SAMHD1. We found that both the catalytic and the allosteric sites of SAMHD1 are sensitive to sugar modifications of the nucleotide analogs, with the allosteric site being significantly more restrictive. We crystallized cladribine-TP, clofarabine-TP, fludarabine-TP, vidarabine-TP, cytarabine-TP, and gemcitabine-TP in the catalytic pocket of SAMHD1. We find that all of these drugs are substrates of SAMHD1 and that the efficacy of most of these drugs is affected by SAMHD1 activity. Of the nucleotide analogues tested, only cladribine-TP with a deoxyribose sugar efficiently induced the catalytically active SAMHD1 tetramer. Together, these results establish a detailed framework for understanding the substrate specificity and allosteric activation of SAMHD1 with regards to nucleotide analogues, which can be used to improve current cancer and antiviral therapies.\n\nSignificanceNucleoside analogue drugs are widely used to treat a variety of cancers and viral infections. With an essential role in regulating the nucleotide pool in the cell by degrading cellular nucleotides, SAMHD1 has the potential to decrease the cellular concentration of frequently prescribed nucleotide analogues and thereby decrease their clinical efficacy in cancer therapy. To improve future nucleotide analogue treatments, it is important to understand SAMHD1 interactions with these drugs. Our work thoroughly examines the extent to which nucleotide analogues interact with the catalytic and allosteric sites of SAMHD1. This work contributes to the assessment of SAMHD1 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy and the future design of SAMHD1 modulators that might improve the efficacy of existing therapies.","10.1073/pnas.1805593115"

Tyrosine sulphation is catalysed by two Golgi-resident enzymes termed Tyrosyl Protein Sulpho Transferases (TPSTs) 1 and 2, which transfer sulphate from the co-factor PAPS (3-phosphoadenosine 5-phosphosulphate) to a context-dependent tyrosine in a protein substrate. A lack of quantitative tyrosine sulphation assays has hampered the development of chemical biology approaches for the identification of small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine sulphation. In this paper, we describe the development of a non-radioactive mobility-based enzymatic assay for TPST1 and TPST2, through which the tyrosine sulphation of synthetic fluorescent peptides can be rapidly quantified. We exploit ligand binding and inhibitor screens to uncover a susceptibility of TPST1 and 2 to different classes of small molecules, including the anti-angiogenic compound suramin and the kinase inhibitor rottlerin. By screening the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS), we identified oxindole-based inhibitors of the Ser/Thr kinase RAF as low micromolar inhibitors of TPST1/2. Interestingly, unrelated RAF inhibitors, exemplified by the dual BRAF/VEGFR2 inhibitor RAF265, were also TPST inhibitors in vitro. We propose that target-validated protein kinase inhibitors could be repurposed, or redesigned, as more-specific TPST inhibitors to help evaluate the sulphotyrosyl proteome. Finally, we speculate that mechanistic inhibition of cellular tyrosine sulphation might be relevant to some of the phenotypes observed in cells exposed to anionic TPST ligands and RAF protein kinase inhibitors.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTWe develop new assays to quantify tyrosine sulphation by the human tyrosine sulphotransferases TPST1 and 2. TPST1 and 2 catalytic activities are inhibited by protein kinase inhibitors, suggesting new starting points to synthesise (or repurpose) small molecule compounds to evaluate biological TPST using chemical biology.","10.1042/bcj20180266"

We propose that fluid-like drag forces generated by the motion of an organ through surrounding tissue could generate changes to its structure that are important for its function. To test this hypothesis, we study the zebrafish left-right organizer, Kupffers vesicle (KV), using experiments and mathematical modeling. During development, monociliated cells that comprise the KV undergo region-specific shape changes along the anterior-posterior axis that are critical for KV function: anterior cells become long and thin, while posterior cells become short and squat. Here, we develop a mathematical vertex-like model for cell shapes, which incorporates both tissue rheology and cell motility, and constrain the model parameters using previously published rheological data for the zebrafish tailbud [Serwane et al.] as well as our own measurements of the KV speed. We find that drag forces due to dynamics of cells surrounding the KV could be sufficient to drive KV cell shape changes during KV development. More broadly, these results suggest that cell shape changes could be driven by dynamic forces not typically considered in models or experiments.","10.1016/j.bpj.2018.10.028"

Genetic interactions demonstrated a balance between positive and negative activities, with vinculin and tensin positively regulating adhesion, while FAK inhibits elevation of integrin activity by tensin, and RSU1 keeps PINCH activity in check. The molecular composition of myofibril termini resolves into 4 distinct layers, one of which is built by a mechanotransduction cascade: vinculin facilitates mechanical opening of filamin, which works with the Arp2/3 activator WASH to build an actin-rich layer positioned between integrins and the first sarcomere.

Mitochondrial function is encoded by genes in two distinct and separately inherited genomes - the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome - and selection is expected to maintain functional mito-nuclear interactions. Nevertheless, high levels of polymorphism in genes involved in these mito-nuclear interactions and variation for mitochondrial function are nevertheless frequently observed, demanding an explanation for how and why variability in such a fundamental trait is maintained. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is a New Zealand freshwater snail with coexisting sexual and asexual individuals and, accordingly, contrasting systems of separate vs. co-inheritance of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. As such, this snail provides a powerful means to dissect the evolutionary and functional consequences of mito-nuclear variation. The lakes inhabited by P. antipodarum span wide environmental gradients, with substantial across-lake genetic structure and mito-nuclear discordance. This situation allows us to use comparisons across reproductive modes and lakes to partition variation in cellular respiration across genetic and environmental axes. Here, we integrated cellular, physiological, and behavioral approaches to quantify variation in mitochondrial function across a diverse set of wild P. antipodarum lineages. We found extensive across-lake variation in organismal oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and behavioral response to heat stress, but few global effects of reproductive mode or sex. Taken together, our data set the stage for applying this important model system for sexual reproduction and polyploidy to dissecting the complex relationships between mito-nuclear variation, performance, plasticity, and fitness in natural populations.","NA"

These seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) play crucial roles in reproduction, such as supporting sperm function, and - particularly in insects - modifying female physiology and behaviour. Identification of Sfps in small animals is challenging, and often relies on samples taken from the female reproductive tract after mating. A key pitfall of this method is that it might miss Sfps that are of low abundance due to dilution in the female-derived sample or rapid processing in females. Here we present a new and complimentary method, which provides added sensitivity to Sfp identification. We applied label-free quantitative proteomics to Drosophila melanogaster male reproductive tissue - where Sfps are unprocessed, and highly abundant - and quantified Sfps before and immediately after mating, to infer those transferred during copulation. We also analysed female reproductive tracts immediately before and after copulation to confirm the presence and abundance of known and candidate Sfps, where possible. Results were cross-referenced with transcriptomic and sequence databases to improve confidence in Sfp detection. Our data was consistent with 124 previously reported Sfps. We found 8 high-confidence novel candidate Sfps, which were both depleted in mated versus unmated males and identified within the reproductive tract of mated but not virgin females. We also identified 31 more candidates that are likely Sfps based on their abundance, known expression and predicted characteristics, and revealed that four proteins previously identified as Sfps are at best minor contributors to the ejaculate. The estimated copy numbers for our candidate Sfps were lower than for previously identified Sfps, supporting the idea that our technique provides a deeper analysis of the Sfp proteome than previous studies. Our results demonstrate a novel, high-sensitivity approach to the analysis of seminal fluid proteomes, whose application will further our understanding of reproductive biology.","10.1074/mcp.ra118.000831"

Host evolutionary history, indeed, appears to drive gut microbial patterns among distantly related species. However, we also find that diet--reliance on leaves versus fruit--is the best predictor of microbiome similarity among closely related lemur species, and that host substrate preference--ground versus tree-- constrains horizontal transmission via incidental contact with feces, with arboreal species harboring far more distinct communities than those of their terrestrial and semi-terrestrial counterparts.","10.1038/s41396-018-0251-5"

Heparan sulphate (HS) glycosaminoglycans control physiological functions ranging from blood coagulation to cell proliferation. HS biosynthesis involves membrane-bound Golgi sulphotransferases, including heparan sulphate 2-O-sulphotransferase (HS2ST), which transfers sulphate from the co-factor PAPS (3-phosphoadenosine 5-phosphosulphate) to the 2-O position of -L-iduronate in the maturing oligosaccharide chain. The current lack of simple non-radioactive enzyme assays that can be used to quantify the levels of carbohydrate sulphation hampers kinetic analysis of this process and the discovery of HS2ST inhibitors. In this paper, we describe a new procedure for thermal shift analysis of purified HS2ST. Using this approach, we quantify HS2ST-catalyzed oligosaccharide sulphation using a novel synthetic fluorescent substrate and screen the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS), to evaluate compounds that inhibit catalysis.

HLA proteins have an essential role in the presentation of self and non-self peptides, as part of the adaptive immune response. Amongst the associated drugs-allele combinations, anti-HIV drug Abacavir has been shown to be associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele, and anti-epilepsy drug Carbamazepine with B*15:02, in both cases likely following the altered peptide repertoire model of interaction. Under this model, the drug binds directly to the antigen presentation region, causing different self peptides to be presented, which trigger an unwanted immune response. There is growing interest in searching for evidence supporting this model for other ADRs using bioinformatics techniques. In this study, in silico docking was used to assess the utility and reliability of well-known docking programs when addressing these challenging HLA-drug situations. Four docking programs: SwissDock, ROSIE, AutoDock Vina and AutoDockFR, were used to investigate if each software could accurately dock the Abacavir back into the crystal structure for the protein arising from the known risk allele, and if they were able to distinguish between the HLA-associated and non-HLA-associated (control) alleles. The impact of using homology models on the docking performance and how using different parameters such as including receptor flexibility affected the docking performance, were also investigated to simulate the approach where a crystal structure for a given HLA allele may be unavailable. The programs that were best able to predict the binding position of Abacavir were then used to recreate the docking seen for Carbamazepine with B*15:02 and controls alleles. It was found that the programmes investigated were sometimes able to correctly predict the binding mode of Abacavir with B*57:01 but not always. Each of the software packages that were assessed could predict the binding of Abacavir and Carbamazepine within the correct sub-pocket and, with the exception of ROSIE, was able to correctly distinguish between risk and control alleles. We found that docking to homology models could produce poorer quality predictions, especially when sequence differences impact the architecture of predicted binding pockets. Caution must therefore be used as inaccurate structures may lead to erroneous docking predictions. Incorporating receptor flexibility was found to negatively affect the docking performance for the examples investigated. Taken together, our findings help characterise the potential but also the limitations of computational prediction of drug-HLA interactions. These docking techniques should therefore always be used with care and alongside other methods of investigation, in order to be able to draw strong conclusions from the given results.","10.1016/j.molimm.2018.08.003"

Hybridization may also affect adaptation through altering sexual dimorphism and sexual conflict, but this remains largely unstudied. Here, we discuss how hybridization may affect sexual dimorphism and conflict due to differential effects of hybridization on males and females, and then how this in turn may affect local adaptation. First, the lower viability of the heterogametic sex in hybrids could shift the balance in sexual conflict. Second, sex-specific inheritance of the mitochondrial genome in hybrids may lead to cyto-nuclear mismatches, for example in the form of \""mothers curse\"", with potential consequences for sex-ratio and sex specific expression. Third, transgressive segregation of sexually antagonistic alleles could lead to greater sexual dimorphism in hybrid populations. These mechanisms can reduce sexual conflict and enhance intersexual niche partitioning, increasing the fitness of hybrids. Adaptive introgression of alleles reducing sexual conflict or enhancing intersexual niche partitioning may facilitate local adaptation, and could favour the colonization of novel habitats. We review these consequences of hybridization on sex differences and local adaptation, and discuss how their prevalence and importance could be tested empirically.","10.1098/rstb.2017.0419"

These components include selected participants and input data, image preprocessing and cross-validation procedures. The performance of the different approaches is also difficult to compare objectively. In particular, it is often difficult to assess which part of the method (e.g. preprocessing, feature extraction or classification algorithms) provides a real improvement, if any. In the present paper, we propose a framework for reproducible and objective classification experiments in AD using three publicly available datasets (ADNI, AIBL and OASIS). The framework comprises: i) automatic conversion of the three datasets into a standard format (BIDS); ii) a modular set of preprocessing pipelines, feature extraction and classification methods, together with an evaluation framework, that provide a baseline for benchmarking the different components. We demonstrate the use of the framework for a large-scale evaluation on 1960 participants using T1 MRI and FDG PET data.

Here, to determine the regionalized morphogenetic impact of Dlx5/6 expression, we specifically target their inactivation or overexpression to NCCs. NCC-specific Dlx5/6 inactivation (NCC{Delta}Dlx5/6) generates severely hypomorphic lower jaws that present typical maxillary traits. Therefore, differently from the symmetric jaws obtained after constitutive Dlx5/6 inactivation, NCC{Delta}Dlx5/6 embryos present a strikingly asymmetric mouth. Reciprocally, forced Dlx5 expression in maxillary NCCs provokes the appearance of distinct mandibular characters in the upper jaw. We conclude that: 1) Dlx5/6 activation in NCCs invariably determines lower jaw identity; 2) the morphogenetic processes that generate functional matching jaws depend on the harmonization of Dlx5/6 expression in NCCs and in distinct ectodermal territories. The co-evolution of synergistic opposing jaws requires the coordination of distinct regulatory pathways involving the same transcription factors in distant embryonic territories.","10.1038/s41598-018-33207-2"

It is unclear, however, whether this uncertainty modulates the neural activity in primary motor cortex (M1) during movement observation.

Consideration of the social environment of bacteria can reveal emergent traits and behaviors that would be overlooked by studying bacteria in isolation. Here we characterize a social trait which emerges upon interaction between the distantly-related soil bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 and Pedobacter sp. V48. On hard agar, which is not permissive for motility of the mono-culture of either species, co-culture reveals an emergent phenotype we term  interspecies social spreading, where the mixed colony spreads across the hard surface. We show that initiation of social spreading requires close association between the two species of bacteria. Both species remain associated throughout the spreading colony, with reproducible and non-homogenous patterns of distribution. The nutritional environment influences social spreading; no social behavior is observed under high nutrient conditions, but low nutrient conditions are insufficient to promote social spreading without high salt concentrations. This simple two-species consortium is a tractable model system that will facilitate mechanistic investigations of interspecies interactions and provide insight into emergent properties of interacting species. These studies will contribute to the broader knowledge of how bacterial interactions influence the functions of communities they inhabit.\n\nImportanceThe wealth of studies on microbial communities has revealed the complexity and dynamics of the composition of communities in many ecological settings. Fewer studies probe the functional interactions of the community members. Function of the community as a whole may not be fully revealed by characterizing the individuals.

Observation of emergent traits suggests there may be many functions of a community that are not predicted based on a priori knowledge of the community members. These types of studies will provide a more holistic understanding of microbial communities, allowing us to connect information about community composition with behaviors determined by interspecific interactions.

We visualise individual nucleosomes at a level of detail that allows us to analyse the conformation of the DNA wrapped around, and measure the distance between the DNA gyres.

However, its physiological significance remains to be demonstrated. Here, we generated loss-of-function mutants of Iduna to investigate its physiological role in Drosophila. Genetic depletion of Iduna causes the accumulation of both Tankyrase and Axin. Increase of Axin protein in enterocytes non-autonomously enhanced stem cell divisions in the Drosophila midgut. Enterocytes secreted Unpaired and thereby stimulated the activity of the JAK-STAT pathway in intestinal stem cells. A decrease in Axin gene expression suppressed both the over-proliferation of stem cells and restored their numbers to normal levels in Iduna mutants.

In 2012, a dedicated Thailand-wide census of sharks, and other animals, began as collaboration between eOceans scientists and the dive tourism industry. Using the observations from 9,524 dives (9,357 hours underwater) logged by >169 divers on 153 sites, we describe the spatial and temporal patterns of sharks in coastal Thailand. A total of 12 shark species were encountered, most commonly (67%) as individuals, and were observed on 11% of all dives, on 59% of sites, in all months and years. The two most frequently encountered species were blacktip reef (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and leopard sharks (Stegostoma fasciatum). Many species had peak encounter rates in summer, but aggregated in various seasons in different years. Mating events and nursery sites were observed rarely, and only for blacktip reef and whitetip reef (Triaenodon obesus) sharks.

Here, we propose a theoretical framework to quantify the invasion fitness of viruses using an epidemiological cell-centric metric that focuses on the proliferation of viral genomes inside cells instead of virus particles outside cells. This cell-centric metric enables direct comparison of viral strategies characterized by obligate killing of hosts (e.g., via lysis), persistence of viral genomes inside hosts (e.g., via lysogeny), and strategies along a continuum between these extremes (e.g., via chronic infections). As a result, we can identify environmental drivers, life history traits, and key feedbacks that govern variation in viral propagation in nonlinear population models. For example, we identify threshold conditions given relatively low densities of susceptible cells and relatively high growth rates of infected cells in which lysogenic and other chronic strategies have higher potential viral reproduction than lytic strategies. Altogether, the theoretical framework helps unify the ongoing study of eco-evolutionary drivers of viral strategies in natural environments.","10.1093/ve/vez006"

For instance, in the mouse prelimbic cortex, 5-HT selectively excites commissurally projecting intratelencephalic (COM) neurons via activation of 5-HT2A (2A) receptors, while simultaneously inhibiting corticofugally projecting pyramidal neurons targeting the pons via 5-HT1A (1A) receptors. Here we characterize the physiology, morphology, and serotonergic regulation of corticoamygdalar (CAm) projection neurons in the mouse prelimbic cortex. Layer 5 CAm neurons shared a number of physiological and morphological characteristics with COM neurons, including higher input resistances, smaller HCN-channel mediated responses, and sparser dendritic arbors than corticopontine neurons. Across cortical lamina, CAm neurons also resembled COM neurons in their serotonergic modulation; focally applied 5-HT (100 {micro}M; 1 s) generated 2A-receptor-mediated excitation, or 1A- and 2A- dependent biphasic responses, in ipsilaterally and contralaterally projecting CAm neurons. Serotonergic excitation depended on extrinsic excitatory drive, as 5-HT failed to depolarize CAm neurons from rest, but could enhance the number of action potentials generated by simulated barrages of synaptic input. Finally, using dual tracer injections, we identified double-labeled CAm/COM neurons that displayed primarily excitatory or biphasic responses to 5-HT. Overall, our findings reveal that prelimbic CAm neurons overlap with COM neurons, and that both neuron subtypes exhibit 2A-dependent serotonergic excitation. Our findings suggest that 5-HT, acting at 2A receptors, will promote cortical output to the amygdala.\n\nSignificance StatementCortical projections to the amygdala allow for executive \""top-down\"" control of emotional responses. Corticoamygdalar (CAm) neurons in the prelimbic cortex contribute to the learning and expression of conditioned fear responses, processes that may also be regulated by serotonin (5-HT). Our study provides a physiological and morphological characterization of prelimbic CAm neurons, and demonstrates that the excitability of CAm neurons is regulated by 5-HT acting at 5-HT2A receptors alone, or in combination with 5-HT1A receptors.

Classification does not fully meet a clinicians needs, however: in order to combine the results of multiple tests and decide on a course of treatment, a clinician needs the likelihood of a given health condition rather than binary classification yielded by such methods. We illustrate how likelihoods can be derived step by step from first principles and approximations, and how they can be assessed and selected, using fMRI data from a publicly available data set containing schizophrenic and healthy control subjects, as a working example. We start from the basic assumption of partial exchangeability, and then the notion of sufficient statistics and the \""method of translation\"" (Edgeworth, 1898) combined with conjugate priors. This method can be used to construct a likelihood that can be used to compare different data-reduction algorithms. Despite the simplifications and possibly unrealistic assumptions used to illustrate the method, we obtain classification results comparable to previous, more realistic studies about schizophrenia, whilst yielding likelihoods that can naturally be combined with the results of other diagnostic tests.","NA"

Here, we investigate influences of offline tDCS on network architecture measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results reveal a tDCS-induced reorganisation of a functionally-defined network that is dependent on whether we are exciting or inhibiting a node within this network, confirming in a functioning brain, and in a bias free and independent fashion that tDCS influences neuronal activity.

It has been argued that these channels also contribute separately to stereoscopic vision. This is based on the fact that observers perform better on a noisy disparity discrimination task when the stimulus is a random-dot pattern consisting of equal numbers of black and white dots (a \""mixed-polarity stimulus\"", argued to activate both ON and OFF stereo channels), than when it consists of all-white or all-black dots (\""same-polarity\"", argued to activate only one). However, it is not clear how this theory can be reconciled with our current understanding of disparity encoding. Recently, a binocular convolutional neural network was able to replicate the mixed-polarity advantage shown by human observers, even though it was based on linear filters and contained no mechanisms which would respond separately to black or white dots. Here, we show that the stimuli used in all these experiments contain a subtle artefact. The interocular correlation between left and right images is actually lower for the same-polarity stimuli than for mixed-polarity stimuli with the same amount of disparity noise applied to the dots. Since our current theories suggest stereopsis is based on a correlation-like computation in primary visual cortex, it is then unsurprising that performance was better for the mixed-polarity stimuli. We conclude that there is currently no evidence supporting separate ON and OFF channels in stereopsis.","NA"

For example, many synaptic properties mature gradually, while emergent network dynamics, as data show, change abruptly. Here, we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate a sudden transition in spontaneous thalamocortical activity necessary for the development of vision. Inspired by in vivo measurements of time-scales and amplitudes of synaptic currents, we extend the Wilson and Cowan model to take into account the relative onset timing and amplitudes of inhibitory and excitatory neural population responses. We study the dynamics of this system and identify the bifurcations as the onset timescales of excitation and inhibition are varied. We focus on the specific typical developmental changes in synaptic timescales consistent with the experimental observations. These findings argue that the inhibitory timing is a critical determinant of thalamocortical activity maturation; a gradual decay of the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory onset time below one drives the system through a bifurcation that leads to a sudden switch of the network spontaneous activity from high-amplitude oscillations to a non-oscillatory active state. This switch also drives a marked change to a linear network response to transient stimuli, agreeing to the in vivo observations. The switch observed in the model is representative of the sudden transition in the sensory cortical activity seen early in development.","10.1152/jn.00402.2019"

Here we examined judgments of motion direction, manipulating difficulty by either motion coherence or salience of irrelevant dots. We manipulated each difficulty type across six levels, from very easy to very hard, and additionally manipulated whether difficulty level was blocked, and thus known in advance, or randomized. Despite the very large manipulations employed, difficulty had little effect on MD activity, especially for the coherence manipulation.

Within each task, individual neurons had spatially-selective response fields, enabling a linear classifier to decode position in the virtual environment in each task. However, the population code did not generalize across tasks. This was due to sensory and mnemonic coding of non-spatial features and their associations by single neurons during each period of the associative memory task. Thus, sensory and mnemonic representations of non-spatial features shape maps of space in the primate hippocampus during virtual navigation. This may reflect a fundamental role of the hippocampus in compressing information from a variety of sources for efficient memory storage.","NA"

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to study the uncertainty of MAP-MRI derived metrics. The noise variability of quantities of MAP-MRI have been quantified using the residual bootstrap, in which the residuals are resampled using two sampling schemes. The residual bootstrap method can provide empirical distributions for MAP-MRI derived quantities, even when the exact distributions are not easily derived. The residual bootstrap methods are applied to SPARC data and HCP-MGH data, and empirical distributions are obtained for the zero-displacement probabilities.

In this work we investigate several aspects of this type of analysis. First, we study the effects of sample size on the sensitivity and reliability of the group analysis, allowing us to evaluate the ability of small sampled studies to effectively capture population-level effects of interest. Second, we assess the difference in sensitivity and reliability when using volumetric or surface based data. Third, we investigate potential biases in estimating effect sizes as a function of sample size. To perform this analysis we utilize the task-based fMRI data from the 500-subject release from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We treat the complete collection of subjects (N = 491) as our population of interest, and perform a single-subject analysis on each subject in the population. We investigate the ability to recover population level effects using a subset of the population and standard analytical techniques. Our study shows that sample sizes of 40 are generally able to detect regions with high effect sizes (Cohens d > 0.8), while sample sizes closer to 80 are required to reliably recover regions with medium effect sizes (0.5 < d < 0.8). We find little difference in results when using volumetric or surface based data with respect to standard mass-univariate group analysis.

In contrast to the genome reduction seen in many obligate intracellular bacteria, early genetic studies of Orientia have revealed one of the most repetitive bacterial genomes sequenced to date. The dramatic expansion of mobile elements has hampered efforts to generate complete genome sequences using short read sequencing methodologies, and consequently there have been few studies of the comparative genomics of this neglected species.\n\nResultsWe report new high-quality genomes of Orientia tsutsugamushi, generated using PacBio single molecule long read sequencing, for six strains: Karp, Kato, Gilliam, TA686, UT76 and UT176.

In Reinforcement Learning (RL) frameworks, this requires learning rates that adapt to past reliability of the model. The observation that behavioural flexibility in animals tends to decrease following prolonged training in stable environment provides experimental evidence for such adaptive learning rates. However, in classical RL models, learning rate is either fixed or scheduled and can thus not adapt dynamically to environmental changes. Here, we propose a new Bayesian learning model, using variational inference, that achieves adaptive change detection by the use of Stabilized Forgetting, updating its current belief based on a mixture of fixed, initial priors and previous posterior beliefs. The weight given to these two sources is optimized alongside the other parameters, allowing the model to adapt dynamically to changes in environmental volatility and to unexpected observations. This approach is used to implement the \""critic\"" of an actor-critic RL model, while the actor samples the resulting value distributions to choose which action to undertake. We show that our model can emulate different adaptation strategies to contingency changes, depending on its prior assumptions of environmental stability, and that model parameters can be fit to real data with high accuracy. The model also exhibits trade-offs between flexibility and computational costs that mirror those observed in real data. Overall, the proposed method provides a general framework to study learning flexibility and decision making in RL contexts.\n\nAuthor summaryIn stable contexts, animals and humans exhibit automatic behaviour that allows them to make fast decisions. However, these automatic processes exhibit a lack of flexibility when environmental contingencies change. In the present paper, we propose a model of behavioural automatization that is based on adaptive forgetting and that emulates these properties. The model builds an estimate of the stability of the environment and uses this estimate to adjust its learning rate and the balance between exploration and exploitation policies. The model performs Bayesian inference on latent variables that represent relevant environmental properties, such as reward functions, optimal policies or environment stability. From there, the model makes decisions in order to maximize long-term rewards, with a noise proportional to environmental uncertainty. This rich model encompasses many aspects of Reinforcement Learning (RL), such as Temporal Difference RL and counterfactual learning, and accounts for the reduced computational cost of automatic behaviour. Using simulations, we show that this model leads to interesting predictions about the efficiency with which subjects adapt to sudden change of contingencies after prolonged training.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006713"

However, estimating VES is resource-intensive. We aim to identify methods to accurately estimate VEs when limited information is available and resources are constrained. We model an individually randomized vaccine trial by generating a network of individuals and simulating an epidemic. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Symptomatic or Infectious and Asymptomatic, Recovered model. We then use seven approaches to estimate VES, and we also estimate vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VEP). A corrected relative risk and an interval censored Cox model accurately estimate VES and only require serologic testing of participants once, while a Cox model using only symptomatic infections returns biased estimates. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10% sample and imputing the remaining infection statuses yields unbiased VES estimates across values of R0 and accurate estimates of VEP for higher values. Identifying resource-preserving methods for accurately estimating VES is important in designing trials for diseases with a high proportion of asymptomatic infection.","10.1093/aje/kwy239"

Currently, there is no analogous, standardized instrument for quantifying household-level water insecurity, which prevents us from understanding both its prevalence and consequences. Therefore, our objectives were to develop and validate a household water insecurity scale appropriate for use in our cohort in western Kenya. We used a range of qualitative techniques to develop a preliminary set of 29 household water insecurity questions, and administered those questions at 15 and 18 months postpartum, concurrent with a suite of other survey modules. These data were complemented by data on quantity of water used and stored, and microbiological quality. Inter-item and item-total correlations were performed to reduce scale items to 20. Exploratory factor and parallel analyses were used to determine the latent factor structure; a unidimensional scale was hypothesized and tested using confirmatory factor and bifactor analyses, along with multiple statistical fit indices. Reliability was assessed using Cronbachs alpha and the coefficient of stability, which produced a coefficient alpha of 0.97 at 15 and 18 months postpartum and a coefficient of stability of 0.62. Predictive, convergent and discriminant validity of the final household water insecurity scale were supported, based on relationships with food insecurity, perceived stress, per capita household water use, and time and money spent acquiring water. The resultant scale is a valid and reliable instrument. It can be used in this setting to test a range of hypotheses about the role of household water insecurity in numerous physical and psychosocial health outcomes, to identify the households most vulnerable to water insecurity, and to evaluate the effects of water-related interventions. To extend its applicability, we encourage efforts to develop a cross-culturally valid scale using robust qualitative and quantitative techniques.","10.1371/journal.pone.0198591"

It also poses a direct threat to human health. In Italy, despite the long lasting efforts and the considerable economic investment, complete eradication of this disease still eludes the southern regions, as opposed to the northern regions that are disease-free. Here we introduced a novel quantitative network-based approach able to fully exploit the highly resolved databases of cattle trade movements and outbreak reports to yield estimates of the vulnerability of a cattle market to brucellosis. Tested on the affected regions, the introduced vulnerability indicator was shown to be accurate in predicting the number of bovine brucellosis outbreaks, thus confirming the suitability of our tool for epidemic risk assessment. We evaluated the dependence of regional vulnerability to brucellosis on a set of factors including premises spatial distribution, trading patterns, farming practices, herd market value, compliance to outbreak regulations, and exploring different epidemiological conditions. Animal trade movements were identified as a major route for brucellosis spread between farms, with an additional potential risk attributed to the use of shared pastures. By comparing the vulnerability of disease-free regions in the north to affected regions in the south, we found that more intense trade and higher market value of the cattle sector in the north, likely inducing more efficient biosafety measures, together with poor compliance to trade restrictions following outbreaks in the south were key factors explaining the diverse success in eradicating brucellosis. Our modeling scheme is both synthetic and effective in gauging regional vulnerability to brucellosis persistence. Its general formulation makes it adaptable to other diseases and host species, providing a useful tool for veterinary epidemiology and policy assessment.","10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.07.004"

However, declines in IPD due to vaccine-targeted serotypes have been partially offset by increases in IPD due to non-vaccine serotypes. The goal of this study was to quantify serotype-specific changes in the incidence of IPD that occurred in different age groups, with or without certain co-morbidities, following the introduction of PCV7 and PCV13 in the childhood vaccination program in Denmark.\n\nMethodsWe used nationwide surveillance data for IPD in Denmark and a hierarchical Bayesian regression framework to estimate changes in the incidence of IPD associated with the introduction of PCV7 (2007) and PCV13 (2010) while controlling for serotype-specific epidemic cycles and unrelated secular trends.\n\nResults and ConclusionsFollowing the introduction of PCV7 and 13 in children, the net impact of serotype replacement varied considerably by age group and the presence of comorbid conditions. Serotype replacement offset a greater fraction of the decline in vaccine-targeted serotypes following the introduction of PCV7 compared with the period following the introduction of PCV13. Differences in the magnitude of serotype replacement were due to variations in the incidence of non-vaccine serotypes in the different risk groups before the introduction of PCV7 and PCV13. The relative increases in the incidence of IPD caused by non-vaccine serotypes did not differ appreciably in the post-vaccination period. Serotype replacement offset a greater proportion of the benefit of PCVs in strata in which the non-vaccine serotypes comprised a larger proportion of cases prior to the introduction of the vaccines. These findings could help to predict the impact of next-generation conjugate vaccines in specific risk groups.","10.1093/cid/ciy875"

Kelleher","University of Houston","2018-04-07",2,"4","new results","evolutionary biology","Transposable elements (TEs) are genomic parasites that impose fitness costs on their hosts by producing deleterious mutations and disrupting gametogenesis. Host genomes avoid these costs by regulating TE activity, particularly in germline cells where new insertions are heritable and TEs are exceptionally active. However, the capacity of different TE-associated fitness costs to select for repression in the host, and the role of selection in the evolution of TE regulation more generally, remain controversial. In this study, we use forward, individual-based simulations to examine the evolution of small-RNA-mediated TE regulation, a conserved mechanism for TE repression that is employed by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To design and parameterize a biologically realistic model, we drew on an extensive survey of empirical studies of the transposition and regulation of P-element DNA transposons in Drosophila melanogaster. We observed that even under conservative assumptions, where small-RNA-mediated regulation reduces transposition only, repression evolves rapidly and adaptively after the genome is invaded by a new TE. We further show that the spread of repressor alleles is greatly enhanced by two additional TE-imposed fitness costs: dysgenic sterility and ectopic recombination. Finally, we demonstrate that the mutation rate to repression (i.e., the size of the mutational target) is a critical parameter that influences both the evolutionary trajectory of host repression and the associated proliferation of TEs after invasion. Our findings suggest that adaptive evolution of TE regulation may be stronger and more prevalent than previously appreciated, and provide a framework for evaluating empirical data.","10.1093/gbe/evy218"

Application of in vivo tractography to the neuroanatomical study of the ILF has generally confirmed its existence, however consensus is lacking regarding its subdivision, laterality and connectivity. Further, there is a paucity of detailed neuroanatomic data pertaining to the exact anatomy of the ILF. Generalized Q-Sampling imaging (GQI) is a non-tensor tractographic modality permitting high resolution imaging of white-matter structures. As it is a non-tensor modality, it permits visualization of crossing fibers and accurate delineation of close-proximity fiber-systems. We applied deterministic GQI tractography to data from 30 healthy subjects and a large-volume diffusion atlas, to delineate ILF anatomy. Post-mortem white matter dissection was also carried out in a cadaveric specimen for further validation. The ILF was found in all 60 hemispheres. At its occipital extremity, it demonstrated a trifurcated termination pattern which was used to separate the ILF into 3 distinct sub-fascicles: Dorsolateral, ventrolateral and ventromedial. These divisions were consistent across the subject set and within the atlas. We applied quantitative techniques to study connectivity strength of the ILF at its anterior and posterior extremities. Overall, the 3 sub-fascicles, and the whole ILF, demonstrated strong leftward-lateralized connectivity patterns. Leftward-lateralization was also found for ILF volumes across the subject set. Due to connective and volumetric leftward-dominance and ventral location, we postulate the ILFs role in the semantic system.

The presence of this general class of behavior is extremely widespread, even though the olfactory sensory apparatus and strategies used may vary between animals. The strategies and cues used by mammals to localize and track odor sources have recently become of interest to neuroscientists, but are still poorly understand. In order to study how mice localize odors, we trained mice to perform a trail following task using a novel behavioral paradigm and behavioral monitoring setup. We find that mice, in order to follow an odor trail, use both sniff by sniff odor concentration comparisons and internares comparisons to guide their behavior. Furthermore, they employ olfactory information to guide adaptive behaviors with remarkably short latencies of approximately 80ms. This study and its findings establish a rich, quantifiable olfactory localization behavior in mice that is amenable to physiological investigations and motivates investigation into the neural substrates of the identified olfactory cues.\n\nSignificanceMany animals, like rodents, rely heavily on their sense smell to guide them as they navigate their environment, to find food and mates and to avoid predators. Yet, in mammals, this function of the olfactory system is much less well studied than odor identification. We created a behavioral task where mice had to follow odor trails in order to efficiently find food and then tracked their movements around those trails. We found that they respond to sniff-by-sniff changes in odor intensity, using those changes to guide movements in less than one tenth of a second and also confirm that they use stereo cues to guide behavior. These results lay the groundwork for determining the brain circuits underlying olfactory navigation.","NA"

Much of what we know about RanBP1 is learned from fungi. Here we show that animal RanBP1 has distinct cargo dissociation and nuclear export mechanisms. In contrast to CRM1-RanGTP sequestration mechanism of cargo dissociation in fungi, animal RanBP1 solely sequesters RanGTP from nuclear export complexes. In fungi, RanBP1, CRM1 and RanGTP form a 1:1:1 nuclear export complex; in contrast, animal RanBP1, CRM1 and RanGTP form a 1:1:2 nuclear export complex. The key feature for the two mechanistic changes from fungi to animals is the loss of affinity between RanBP1-RanGTP and CRM1, since residues mediating their interaction in fungi are not conserved in animals. The biological significances of these different mechanisms in fungi and animals are also studied and discussed. Our study illustrates how orthologous proteins may play conserved functions through distinct routes, and may provide directions for design of antifungal medicines.","10.7554/eLife.41331"

Large expansions elicit repeat and promoter hyper-methylation, heterochromatin formation, FMR1 transcriptional silencing, and loss of the Fragile X protein, FMRP. Efforts aimed at correcting the sequelae resultant from FMRP loss have thus far proven insufficient, perhaps because of FMRPs pleiotropic functions. As the repeats do not disrupt the FMRP coding sequence, reactivation of endogenous FMR1 gene expression could correct the proximal event in FXS pathogenesis. Here we utilize the CRISPR/dCAS9 system to selectively re-activate transcription from the silenced FMR1 locus. Fusion of the transcriptional activator VP192 to dCAS9 robustly enhances FMR1 transcription and increases FMRP levels when targeted directly to the CGG repeat in human cells. Using a previously uncharacterized FXS human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line which acquires transcriptional silencing with serial passaging, we achieved locus-specific transcriptional re-activation of FMR1 mRNA expression despite promoter and repeat methylation.

In the brain it is highly prevalent, presumably because proteome diversity is crucial for establishing the complex circuitry between trillions of neurons.

Previously, we found that the mutually exclusive alternative splicing of a cell surface protein, Dscam2 produces two isoforms (exon 10A and 10B) with unique binding properties. This splicing event is tightly regulated and crucial for maintaining axon terminal size, dendritic morphology and synaptic numbers. Here, we show that Drosophila Muscleblind (Mbl), a conserved splicing factor implicated in myotonic dystrophy, controls Dscam2 alternative splicing. Removing mbl from cells that normally express isoform B induces the expression of isoform A and eliminates the expression of B, demonstrating that Mbl represses one alternative exon and selects the other. Mbl mutants exhibit phenotypes that are also observed in flies engineered to express a single isoform. Consistent with these observations, mbl expression is cell-type-specific and correlates with the expression of isoform B.

Benzoxaborole-based compounds are very promising potential novel anti-trypanosomal therapies, with candidates already in human and animal clinical trials. Their targets in trypanosomes were hitherto unknown. We investigated the mechanism of action of several benzoxaboroles, including AN7973, an early candidate for veterinary trypanosomosis.\n\nIn all kinetoplastids, transcription is polycistronic. Individual mRNA 5-ends are created by trans splicing of a short leader sequence, with coupled polyadenylation of the preceding mRNA. Treatment of Trypanosoma brucei with AN7973 inhibited trans splicing within 1h, as judged by loss of the Y-structure splicing intermediate and reduced levels of mRNA, and accumulation of peri-nuclear granules which are typical for splicing inhibition. Methylation of the spliced leader precursor RNA was not affected, but more prolonged AN7973 treatment caused an increase in S-adenosyl methionine and methylated lysine. Together, these results indicate that mRNA processing is the primary target of AN7973. Polyadenylation is required for kinetoplastid trans splicing. The EC50 for AN7973 in T. brucei was increased three-fold by over-expression of the T. brucei cleavage and polyadenylation factor CPSF3, identifying CPSF3 as a potential molecular target. Our results thus chemically validate mRNA processing as a viable drug target in trypanosomes.\n\nSeveral other benzoxaboroles showed metabolomic and splicing effects that were similar to those of AN7973, identifying splicing inhibition as a common mode of action, and suggesting that it might be linked to subsequent changes in methylated metabolites. Granule formation, splicing inhibition, and resistance after CPSF3 expression did not, however, always correlate, and prolonged selection of trypanosomes in AN7973 resulted in only 1.5-fold resistance. This suggests that the modes of action of oxaboroles that target trypanosome mRNA processing may extend beyond CPSF3 inhibition.\n\nAuthor summaryTrypanosomes and leishmanias infect millions of humans and cause economically devastating diseases of livestock; the few existing drugs have serious deficiencies. Trypanosomosis of cattle, caused mainly by Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax, is a serious problem in Africa, because bovids are used not only for meat and milk, but also for traction. Only two drugs are in routine use for chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis of bovine trypanosomosis. A single injection of the benzoxaborole compound AN7973 was sufficient to cure T. congolense infection in cattle and goats, but AN7973 was less effective against T. vivax. This precluded development of AN7973 as a commercially viable treatment against cattle trypanosomosis, but it could still have potential for diseases caused by other salivarian trypanosomes.\n\nWe used a large range of methods to find out how AN7973 kills trypanosomes, and compared it with several other benzoxaboroles. AN7973 and some of the other compounds had effects on parasite metabolism that resembled those previously seen for a benzoxaborole that is being tested for human sleeping sickness. The most rapid effect of AN7973, however, was on processing of trypanosome mRNA. As a consequence, amounts of mRNA decreased and synthesis of proteins stopped. We conclude that AN7973 and some other benzoxaboroles kill trypanosomes by stopping gene expression.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007315"

This appears to result from a defective brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) - tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) - Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling pathway that impacts the interaction between the AMPAR auxiliary subunit stargazin and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95). Notably, the disturbed AMPAR surface diffusion is rescued, via BDNF signaling pathway and by the antidepressant tianeptine. Tianeptine also restores the impaired LTP and hippocampus-dependent memory as well as anxiety/depression-like behavior in different HD mouse models. We thus unveil a mechanistic framework underlying hippocampal synaptic and memory dysfunction and propose a new perspective in HD treatment by targeting AMPAR surface diffusion.","NA"

This study investigates factors previously associated with evolution acceptance as well as other potential factors among students over the course of a year-long majors and non-majors introductory biology sequence at a private, research-intensive university in the northeastern United States. Acceptance of evolution was measured using the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) instrument, and other factors were measured using well-established instruments and a demographic survey. As expected given the context, evolution was widely accepted among the population (71% of our sample scored in the \""high\"" or \""very high\"" acceptance range), but 160 students were in the very low to moderate acceptance range. Over the course of the academic year, regressions on measures of normalized change revealed that as knowledge of the Nature of Science (NOS) increased, evolution acceptance increased (R2 = .378, p << 0.001). Increasing levels of genetic literacy (R2 = .214, p << 0.001) and Evolutionary Knowledge (R2 = .177, p << 0.001) were also significantly associated with increases in acceptance of evolution. We also examined the longitudinal effect of combining various factors into unified working models of acceptance of evolution, and this is the first study by our knowledge to do so. From fall to spring, the influence of student knowledge of NOS on evolution acceptance increased, as did the influence of genetic literacy. Conversely, the influence of religious variables decreased, as did the influence of political inclinations and race/ethnicity. Our results indicate that as students learn more about the nature of science, they may rely more on scientific explanations for natural phenomena. This study also underscores the importance of using longitudinal, multifactorial analyses to understand acceptance of evolution.","NA"

FAVITES creates a generative model to produce contact networks, transmission networks, phylogenetic trees, and sequence datasets, and to add error to the data. FAVITES is designed to be extensible by dividing the generative model into modules, each of which is expressed as a fixed API that can be implemented using various models. We use FAVITES to simulate HIV datasets and study the realism of the simulated datasets.

Since existing software and pipelines for sRNA annotation are mostly focused on analyzing miRNAs or piRNAs, here we developed the sRNA annotation pipeline optimized for rRNA- and tRNA- derived sRNAs (SPORTS1.0). SPORTS1.0 is optimized for analyzing tsRNAs and rsRNAs from sRNA-seq data, in addition to its capacity to annotate canonical sRNAs such as miRNAs and piRNAs. Moreover, SPORTS1.0 can predict potential RNA modification sites based on nucleotide mismatches within sRNAs. SPORTS1.0 is precompiled to annotate sRNAs for a wide range of 68 species across bacteria, yeast, plant, and animal kingdoms, while additional species for analyses could be readily expanded upon end users input. For demonstration, by analyzing sRNA datasets using SPORTS1.0, we reveal that distinct signatures are present in tsRNAs and rsRNAs from different mouse cell types. We also find that compared to other sRNA species, tsRNAs bear the highest mismatch rate which is consistent with their highly modified nature.

Here, we model distinct modes of virus-host interactions and study their impact on the abundance and diversity of both viruses and their microbial hosts. We consider two distinct viral populations infecting the same microbial population via two different strategies: lytic and chronic. A lytic strategy corresponds to viruses that exclusively infect and lyse their hosts to release new virions. A chronic strategy corresponds to viruses that infect hosts and then continually release new viruses via a budding process without cell lysis. The chronic virus can also be passed on to daughter cells during cell division. The long-term association of virus and microbe in the chronic mode drives differences in selective pressures with respect to the lytic mode. We utilize invasion analysis of the corresponding nonlinear differential equation model to study the ecology and evolution of heterogenous viral strategies. We first investigate stability of equilibria, and characterize oscillatory and bistable dynamics in some parameter regions. Then, we derive fitness quantities for both virus types and investigate conditions for competitive exclusion and coexistence. In so doing we find unexpected results, including a regime in which the chronic virus requires the lytic virus for survival and invasion.","10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.10.056"

A.; Duncan, J.; Manly, T.","Ausaf A Farooqui","MRC Cognition & Brain Sciences Unit","2018-04-07",1,"15","new results","neuroscience","AbstractThe well-known deactivation of the Default Mode Network (DMN) during external tasks is usually thought to reflect the suppression of internally directed mental activity during external attention. In 3 experiments with human participants we organized sequences of task events identical in their attentional and control demands into larger task episodes. We found that DMN deactivation across such sequential events was never constant, but was maximum at the beginning of the episode, then decreased gradually across the episode, reaching baseline towards episode completion, with the final event of the episode eliciting an activation. Crucially, this pattern of activity was not limited to a fixed set of DMN regions but, across experiments, was shown by a variable set of regions expected to be uninvolved in processing the ongoing task. This change in deactivation across sequential but identical events showed that the deactivation cannot be related to attentional/control demands which were constant across the episode, instead it has to be related to some episode related load that was maximal at the beginning and then decreased gradually as parts of the episode got executed. We argue that this load resulted from cognitive programs through which the entire episode was hierarchically executed as one unit. At the beginning of task episodes, programs related to their entire duration is assembled, causing maximal deactivation. As execution proceeds, elements within the program related to the completed parts of the episode dismantle, thereby decreasing the program load and causing a decrease in deactivation.\n\nSignificance StatementWe prepare breakfasts and write emails, and not individually execute their many component acts. The current study suggests that cognitive entities that enable such hierarchical execution of goal-directed behavior may cause the ubiquitously seen deactivation during external task execution. Further, while this deactivation has previously been associated with a defined set of the so called default mode regions, current study demonstrates that deactivation is shown by any region not currently involved in task execution, and in certain task episodes can even include attention related fronto-parietal regions as well as primary sensory and motor regions.","10.1523/eneuro.0008-18.2018"

While many qualitative predictions of behavior exist, accurate quantitative models, tested by empirical data, are often lacking. This is likely due to variation in biases across individuals and variation in the way new information is gathered and used. We propose a modeling framework based on a novel interpretation of Bayes theorem to integrate optimization of energetic constraints with both prior biases and specific sources of new information gathered by individuals. We present methods for inferring distributions of prior biases within populations rather than assuming known priors, as is common in Bayesian approaches to modelling behavior, and for evaluating the goodness of fit of overall model descriptions. We apply this framework to predict optimal escape during predator-prey encounters, based on prior biases and variation in what information prey use. Using this approach we collected and analyzed data characterizing white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) escape behavior in response to human approaches. We found that distance to predator alone was not sufficient for predicting deer flight response, and have shown that the inclusion of additional information is necessary. Additionally, we compared differences in the inferred distributions of prior biases across different populations and discuss the possible role of human activity in influencing these distributions.","10.1086/698692"

Recently, it has been proposed that psychotic traits may be linked to impaired predictive processes. Here, we examine the brain dynamics underlying sensory learning and inference in stable and volatile environments, in a population of healthy individuals (N=75) with a range of psychotic-like experiences. We measured prediction error responses to sound sequences with electroencephalography, gauged sensory inference explicitly by behaviourally recording sensory  regularity learning errors, and used dynamic causal modelling to tap into the underlying neural circuitry. We discuss the findings that were robust to replication across the two experiments (N=31 and N=44 for the discovery and the validation datasets, respectively). First, we found that during stable conditions, participants demonstrated a stronger predictive model, reflected in a larger prediction error response to unexpected sounds, and decreased regularity learning errors. Moreover, individuals with attenuated prediction errors in stable conditions were found to make greater incorrect predictions about sensory information. Critically, we show that greater errors in sensory learning and inference are related to increased psychotic-like experiences. These findings link neurophysiology to behaviour during sensory learning and prediction formation, as well as providing further evidence for the idea of a continuum of psychosis in the healthy, non-clinical population.

Significance StatementWhilst perceiving the world, we make inferences by learning the regularities present in the sensory environment. It has been argued that psychosis may emerge due to a failure to learn sensory regularities, resulting in an impaired representation of the world. Recently it has been proposed that psychosis exists on a continuum; however, there is conflicting evidence on whether sensory learning deficits align on the non-clinical end of the psychosis continuum. We found that sensory learning is associated with brain prediction errors, and critically, it is impaired in healthy people who report more psychotic-like experiences. We replicated these findings in an independent sample, demonstrating strengthened credibility to support that the continuum of psychosis extends into the non-clinical population.","NA"

We measured thresholds for 99-pulse-per-second trains of triphasic (TP) pulses where the central high-amplitude phase was either anodic (TP-A) or cathodic (TP-C). Thresholds were obtained in monopolar mode from four or five electrodes and a total of eight ears from subjects implanted with the Advanced Bionics CI. When between-subject differences were removed, there was a modest but significant correlation between the polarity effect (TP-C threshold minus TP-A threshold) and the average of TP-C and TP-A thresholds, consistent with the hypothesis that a large polarity effect corresponds to good neural survival. When data were averaged across electrodes for each subject, relatively low thresholds for TP-C correlated with a high \""upper limit\"" (the pulse rate up to which pitch continues to increase) from a previous study [Cosentino S, Carlyon RP, Deeks JM, Parkinson W, Bierer JA (2016) Rate discrimination, gap detection and ranking of temporal pitch in cochlear implant users.

RNA sequencing confirmed that EToV utilises a unique combination of discontinuous and non-discontinuous RNA synthesis to produce its subgenomic RNAs; indeed, we identified transcripts arising from both mechanisms that would result in sgRNAs encoding the nucleocapsid. Our ribosome profiling analysis revealed that ribosomes efficiently translate two novel CUG-initiated ORFs, located within the so-called 5 UTR. We have termed the resulting proteins U1 and U2.

These findings may have general implications on the isolation of resistance-conferring mutations and specifically, may affect the design of future generations of fosmidomycin-based drugs.\n\nSignificanceThe emergence of acquired drug resistance is a natural process that is likely to occur under most circumstances. Recently-developed technologies allow to map relative fitness contribution of multiple mutations in parallel. Such approaches may be used to predict which mutations are most likely to confer resistance, instead of waiting for them to evolve spontaneously. In this study, a rationally-designed IspC mutant library was generated genomically in E. coli. Mutants resistant to fosmidomycin, an antimalarial drug were identified, and most were in the highly conserved proline at position 274. These results may have implications on next-generation fosmidomycin drug design, and more broadly, this approach may be used for predicting mutational acquired resistance.","NA"

Convergent results suggest that this mechanism is associated with specific neural circuits located within the Central Complex (CC). Furthermore such circuits appear to be associated with visual attention, specifically with selective attention processes implicated in the control of action. Our aim was to understand how wild-type flies react to the abrupt appearance of a visual distractor during an ongoing locomotor action. Thus, we adapted the well-known  Buridan paradigm, used to study walking behaviour in flies, so we could specifically address the mechanisms involved in action selection. We found that flies tended to react in one of two ways when confronted with a visual distractor during ongoing locomotion. Flies either: (i) committed to a new path situated midway between the original target and the distractor, consistent with a novelty effect; or (ii) remained on the original trajectory with a slight deviation in direction of the distractor. We believe that these results provide the first indication of how flies react, from the motor point of view, in a bi-stable context requiring the presence of selection-for-action mechanisms. Some considerations on the neural circuits underlying such behavioural responses are advanced.","NA"

HIF-1 subunit abundance is post-translationally regulated by prolyl-hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs), which use molecular O2 and -ketoglutarate to hydroxylate two prolyl-residues in HIF-1. Three PHDs have been identified and PHD2 is the most critical regulator of HIF-1. HIF-1 can also be activated independently of hypoxia and in some cases this is due to changes in PHD2 abundance through poorly understood mechanisms. Previously, we reported that under O2-replete conditions that the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii activates HIF-1 by reducing PHD2 protein abundance. Here, we demonstrate that Toxoplasma regulates PHD2 through a multistep process. First, PHD2 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein and Toxoplasma induces PHD2 cytoplasmic accumulation to separate it from nuclear HIF-1. PHD2 is then degraded by lysosomes independently of the major autophagic processes, macroautophagy or chaperone-mediated autophagy. Rather, PHD2 interacts with the major lysosomal membrane protein, LAMP1, which is required for HIF-1 activation. These data therefore highlight for the first time that cytoplasmic trapping and subsequent lysosomal degradation of a host nucleocytoplasmic protein is a mechanism used by a microbial pathogen to regulate host gene expression.","NA"

The network is based on units representing assemblies of pools of neurons, with preferentially strong recurrent excitatory connections within each unit. Such excitatory feedback to a unit can generate bistability, though in many networks only under conditions of net excitatory input from other units. Weak interactions between units leads to a multiplicity of attractor states, within which information can persist beyond stimulus offset. When a new stimulus arrives, the prior state of the network impacts the encoding of the incoming information, with short-term synaptic depression ensuring an itinerancy between sets of active units. We assess the ability of such a network to encode the identity of sequences of stimuli, so as to provide a template for sequence recall, or decisions based on accumulation of evidence. Across a range of parameters, such networks produce the primacy (better final encoding of the earliest stimuli) and recency (better final encoding of the latest stimuli) observed in human recall data and can retain the information needed to make a binary choice based on total number of presentations of a specific stimulus. Similarities and differences in the final states of the network produced by different sequences lead to predictions of specific errors that could arise when an animal or human subject generalizes from training data, when the training data comprises a subset of the entire stimulus repertoire. We suggest that such networks can provide the robust general purpose computational engines needed for us to solve many cognitive tasks.","NA"

Previously, we showed that G564 mRNA, encoding a protein of unknown function, accumulates to high levels in the giant suspensor of both Scarlet Runner Bean (SRB) and Common Bean embryos, and a cis-regulatory module containing three unique DNA sequences, designated as the 10-bp, Region 2, and Fifth motifs, is required for G564 suspensor-specific transcription [Henry, K.

We tested the hypothesis that these motifs are also required for transcription of the SRB GA 20-oxidase gene, which encodes a gibberellic acid hormone biosynthesis enzyme and is co-expressed with G564 at a high level in giant bean suspensors. We used deletion and gain-of-function experiments in transgenic tobacco embryos to show that two GA 20-oxidase DNA regions are required for suspensor-specific transcription - one in the 5 untranslated region (UTR) (+119 to +205) and another in the 5 upstream region (-341 to -316).

Our results demonstrate the flexibility of motif positioning within a cis-regulatory module that activates gene transcription within giant bean suspensors, and suggest that G564 and GA 20-oxidase comprise part of a suspensor gene regulatory network.\n\nSignificanceLittle is known about how genes are expressed in different plant embryo regions. We tested the hypothesis that shared cis-regulatory motifs control the transcription of genes specifically in the suspensor. We carried out functional studies with the Scarlet Runner Bean (SRB) GA 20-oxidase gene that encodes a gibberellic acid (GA) hormone biosynthesis enzyme, and is expressed specifically within the suspensor. We show that cis-regulatory motifs required for GA 20-oxidase transcription within the suspensor are the same as those required for suspensor-specific transcription of the SRB G564 gene, although motif number, spacing and order differ. These cis-elements constitute a control module that is required to activate genes in the SRB suspensor and may form part of a suspensor regulatory network.","10.1073/pnas.1805802115"

The F test is the standard equal-variance test in Statistics. For high-throughput genomic data, the probe-wise F test has been successfully used to detect biologically relevant DNA methylation marks that have different variances between two groups of subjects (e.g., cases vs. controls). In addition to DNA methylation, microRNA is another mechanism of epigenetics. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have identified differentially variable (DV) microRNAs. In this article, we proposed a novel model-based clustering to improve the power of the probe-wise F test to detect DV microRNAs. We imposed special structures on covariance matrices for each cluster of microRNAs based on the prior information about the relationship between variance in cases and variance in controls and about the independence among cases and controls. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first clustering algorithm that aims to detect DV genomic probes. Simulation studies showed that the proposed method outperformed the probe-wise F test and had certain robustness to the violation of the normality assumption.

We combine biophysical modeling and analysis of live-cell calcium imaging to explain the fast calcium transient in spines. We show that in the presence of a spine apparatus (SA), which is an extension of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), calcium transients during synaptic inputs rely on rare and extreme calcium ion trajectories. Using numerical simulations, we predicted the asymmetrical distributions of Ryanodine receptors and SERCA pumps that we confirmed experimentally. When calcium ions are released in the spine head, the fastest ions arriving at the base determine the transient timescale through a calcium-induced calcium release mechanism. In general, the fastest particles arriving at a small target are likely to be a generic mechanism that determines the timescale of molecular transduction in cellular neuroscience.\n\nSignificance statementIntrigued by fast calcium transients of few milliseconds in dendritic spines, we investigated its underlying biophysical mechanism. We show here that it is generated by the diffusion of the fastest calcium ions when the spine contains a Spine Apparatus, an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum. This timescale is modulated by the initial number of released calcium ions and the asymmetric distribution of its associated calcium release associated Ryanodyne receptors, present only at the base of a spine. This novel mechanism of calcium signaling that we have unraveled here is driven by the fastest particles. To conclude, the rate of arrival of the fastest particles (ions) to a small target receptor defines the timescale of activation instead of the classical forward rate of chemical reactions introduced by von Smoluchowski in 1916. Applying this new rate theory to transduction should refine our understanding of the biophysical mechanisms underlying molecular signaling.","NA"

The visual system provides essential but slow feedback. In contrast, mechanosensory channels can provide feedback at much shorter timescales. How the contributions from these two senses are integrated remains an open question in most insect groups. In Diptera, fast mechanosensory feedback is provided by organs called halteres, and is crucial for the control of rapid flight manoeuvres, while vision controls manoeuvres in lower temporal frequency bands. Here we have investigated the visual-mechanosensory integration in an insect which lacks halteres: the hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum. They represent a large group of insects that use Johnstons organs in their antennae to provide mechanosensory feedback on perturbations in body position. High-speed videos of freely-flying hawkmoths hovering at stationary or oscillating artificial flowers showed that positional fidelity during flight was reduced in flagella ablated animals, but was recovered after flagella re-attachment. Our experiments show that antennal mechanosensory feedback specifically mediates fast flight manoeuvres, but not slow ones. Differences in the latency of visual feedback (in different light intensities) affected all antennal conditions equally, suggesting there was no compensatory interaction between antennal and visual feedback under the tested conditions.

The high throughput is made possible by the early introduction of sample-specific barcodes (BCs) and the amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Thus the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI. zUMIs is such a pipeline, it can handle both known and random BCs and also efficiently collapses UMIs, either just for Exon mapping reads or for both Exon and Intron mapping reads. Another unique feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function, that facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes, but also allows to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to saturation. zUMIs flexibility allows to accommodate data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use BCs and UMIs. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analysed a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35% of all reads map to Introns.

In contrast to epithelial cells, productive infection of most IAV strains is either blocked or highly inefficient in macrophages. The exact nature of the defect in IAV replication in human macrophages remains unknown. In this study, we showed that primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are inefficient in IAV release even when compared to a monocytic cell line differentiated to macrophage-like cells, despite comparable levels of expression of viral glycoproteins at the plasma membrane. Correlative fluorescence scanning electron microscopy revealed that formation of budding structures at the cell surface is inefficient in MDM even though clustering of a viral glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), is observed, suggesting that IAV particle assembly is blocked in human MDM. Using an in situ proximity ligation assay, we further determined that association between HA and the viral ion channel protein M2 is defective at the plasma membrane of MDM. In contrast, HA and another glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) associate with each other on the MDM surface efficiently. Notably, the defect in association between HA and M2 in MDM was reversed upon inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D. Altogether, these results suggest that HA-M2 association on the plasma membrane is a discrete step in the IAV assembly process, which is separable from the association between HA and NA and susceptible to suppression by actin cytoskeleton. Overall, our study revealed the presence of a cell-type-specific mechanism negatively regulating IAV assembly at the plasma membrane.\n\nImportanceIdentification of host cell determinants promoting or suppressing replication of many viruses has been aided by analyses of host cells that impose inherent blocks on viral replication. In this study, we show that primary human MDM are not permissive to IAV replication due to a defect at the virus particle formation step. This defect is specific to primary human macrophages, since a human monocytic cell line differentiated to macrophage-like cells supports IAV particle formation. We further identified association between two viral transmembrane proteins, HA and M2, on the cell surface as a discrete assembly step, which is defective in MDM. Defective HA-M2 association in MDM is rescued by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, revealing a previously unknown, negative role for actin polymerization, which is generally thought to play positive roles in IAV assembly. Overall, our study uncovered a host-mediated restriction of association between viral transmembrane components during IAV assembly.","10.1128/mbio.01916-18"

M.","Daniel Kaiser","FU Berlin","2018-04-08",2,"3","new results","neuroscience","In everyday visual environments, objects are non-uniformly distributed across visual space. Many objects preferentially occupy particular retinotopic locations: for example, lamps more often fall into the upper visual field, whereas carpets more often fall into the lower visual field. The long-term experience with natural environments prompts the hypothesis that the visual system is tuned to such retinotopic object locations. A key prediction is that typically positioned objects should be coded more efficiently. To test this prediction, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants viewed briefly presented objects appearing in their typical locations (e.g., an airplane in the upper visual field) or in atypical locations (e.g., an airplane in the lower visual field). Multivariate pattern analysis applied to the EEG data revealed that object classification depended on positional regularities: Objects were classified more accurately when positioned typically, rather than atypically, already at 140 ms, suggesting that relatively early stages of object processing are tuned to typical retinotopic locations. Our results confirm the prediction that long-term experience with objects occurring at specific locations leads to enhanced perceptual processing when these objects appear in their typical locations. This may indicate a neural mechanism for efficient natural scene processing, where a large number of typically positioned objects needs to be processed.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.05.006"

The problem is that local demographic stochasticity generates eco-evolutionary dynamics that are too complicated to make tractable analytical investigations. Here, we circumvent this problem by approximating the selection gradient on a quantitative trait that influences local community dynamics, assuming that such dynamics are deterministic with a stable fixed point, but incorporating the kin selection effects arising from demographic stochasticity. Our approximation reveals that selection depends on how an individual expressing a trait-change influences: (1) its own fitness and the fitness of its current relatives; and (2) the fitness of its downstream relatives through modifications of local ecological conditions (i.e., through ecological inheritance). Mathematically, the effects of ecological inheritance on selection are captured by dispersal-limited versions of press-perturbations of community ecology. We use our approximation to investigate the evolution of helping within- and harming between-species when these behaviours influence demography. We find helping evolves more readily when competition is for material resources rather than space because then, the costs of kin competition are paid by downstream relatives. Similarly, harming between species evolves when it alleviates downstream relatives from inter-specific competition. Beyond these examples, our approximation can help better understand the influence of ecological inheritance on a variety of eco-evolutionary dynamics, from plant-pollinator to predator-prey coevolution.","10.1086/700094"

In honey bees, short and long-lived host phenotypes are polarized by a suite of age-associated factors including hormones, nutrition, immune senescence and oxidative stress. Similar to other model organisms, the aging gut microbiota of short-lived (worker) honey bees accrue Proteobacteria and are depleted of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, consistent with a suite of host senescence markers. In contrast, long-lived (queen) honey bees maintain youthful cellular function without expressing oxidative stress genes, suggesting a very different host environment for age-associated microbial succession.\n\nResultsWe sequenced the microbiota of 63 honey bee queens exploring two chronological ages and four alimentary tract niches. To control for individual variation we quantified carbonyl accumulation in queen fat body tissue as a proxy for biological aging. We compared our results to the age-specific microbial succession of worker guts. Accounting for queen source variation, two or more bacterial species per niche differed significantly by queen age. Biological aging in queens was correlated with microbiota composition highlighting the relationship of microbiota with oxidative stress. Queens and workers shared many major gut bacterial species, but differ markedly in community structure and age succession. In stark contrast to aging workers, carbonyl accumulation in queens was significantly associated with increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and depletion of various Proteobacteria.\n\nConclusionsWe present a model system linking changes in gut microbiota to diet and longevity, two of the most confounding variables in human microbiota research. As described for other model systems, metabolic changes associated with diet and host longevity correspond to the changing microbiota. The pattern of age-associated succession in the queen microbiota is largely the reverse of that demonstrated for workers. The guts of short-lived worker phenotypes are progressively dominated by three major Proteobacteria, but these same species were sparse or significantly depleted in long-lived queen phenotypes. More broadly, our results suggest that lifespan evolution formed the context for host-microbial interactions and age-related succession of honey bee microbiota.","10.1186/s40168-018-0489-1"

PTBP1 maintains non-neuronal splicing patterns of mRNAs that switch to neuronal isoforms upon neuronal differentiation. We find that pri-miR-124-1 is expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) where mature miR-124 is absent. PTBP1 binds to this precursor RNA upstream of the miRNA stem-loop to inhibit mature miR-124 expression in vivo, and DROSHA cleavage of pri-miR-124-1 in vitro. This new function for PTBP1 in repressing miR-124 biogenesis adds an additional regulatory loop to the already intricate interplay between these two molecules. Applying mathematical modeling to examine the dynamics of this regulation, we find that the pool of pri-miR-124 whose maturation is blocked by PTBP1 creates a robust and self-reinforcing transition in gene expression as PTBP1 is depleted during early neuronal differentiation. While interlocking regulatory loops are often modeled between miRNAs and transcriptional regulators, our results indicate that miRNA targeting of posttranscriptional regulators also reinforces developmental decisions.

Soloway","Cornell University","2018-04-08",1,"4","new results","molecular biology","Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have garnered much attention as possible links between DNA sequence and the protein factors that mediate DNA methylation. However, the mechanisms by which DNA methylation is directed to specific genomic locations remain poorly understood. We previously identified a lncRNA in mouse, the pitRNA, that was implicated in the control of DNA methylation at the imprinted Rasgrf1 locus. The pitRNA is transcribed in the developing male germline antisense to the differentially methylated region (DMR) that harbors paternal allele methylation, and is driven by a series of tandem repeats that are necessary for imprinted methylation.\n\nMitoPLD, a factor necessary for piRNA biogenesis, both processes piRNAs from the pitRNA, and is necessary for complete methylation at the locus, along with piRNA binding proteins. Using two independent mouse systems where pitRNA transcription is driven by the doxycycline-inducible Tet Operator, we demonstrate that pitRNA transcription across the DMR is insufficient for imprinted methylation, and that the Rasgrf1 repeats have additional, critical cis-acting roles for imparting DNA methylation to Rasgrf1, independently of their control of pitRNA transcription. Furthermore, pitRNA overexpression and oocyte loading of pitRNA is insufficient to induce transallelic and transgenerational effects previously reported for Rasgrf1. Notably, manipulation of the pitRNA with the TetOFF system led to transcriptional perturbations over a broad chromosomal region surrounding the inserted Tet Operator, revealing that the effects of this regulatory tool are not localized to a single target gene.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDNA methylation is a heritable genetic modification known to impact vital biological processes. While the proteins that establish, maintain, and remove DNA methylation are well characterized, the mechanisms by which these proteins are directed to specific genetic sequences are poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that DNA methylation at the imprinted Rasgrf1 locus requires a DNA element with a series of tandem repeats. These repeats act as a promoter for a long noncoding RNA, the pitRNA, which is targeted by a small noncoding RNA pathway known to silence viral elements in the male germline via DNA methylation. We queried the sufficiency of the pitRNA to mediate DNA methylation at Rasgrf1. We show that, in the absence of the repeats, the pitRNA expression is insufficient to establish imprinted methylation. This work supports a pitRNA-independent mechanism for methylation at Rasgrf1, and a critical cis-acting role for the tandem repeats separate from their control of pitRNA transcription.","NA"

Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a complex scaffolding protein enriched in CA2 dendritic spines that naturally blocks CA2 synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning, but the cellular mechanisms by which RGS14 gates LTP are largely unexplored. A previous study has attributed the lack of plasticity to higher rates of calcium (Ca2+) buffering and extrusion in CA2 spines. Additionally, a recent proteomics study revealed that RGS14 interacts with two key Ca2+-activated proteins in CA2 neurons: calcium/calmodulin, and CaMKII. Here, we investigate whether RGS14 regulates Ca2+ signaling in its host CA2 neurons. We find the nascent LTP of CA2 synapses due to genetic knockout (KO) of RGS14 in mice requires Ca2+-dependent postsynaptic signaling through NMDA receptors, CaMK, and PKA, revealing similar mechanisms to those in CA1. We report RGS14 negatively regulates the long-term structural plasticity of dendritic spines of CA2 neurons. We further show that wild-type (WT) CA2 neurons display significantly attenuated spine Ca2+ transients during structural plasticity induction compared with the Ca2+ transients from CA2 spines of RGS14 KO mice and CA1 controls. Finally, we demonstrate that acute overexpression of RGS14 is sufficient to block spine plasticity, and elevating extracellular Ca2+ levels restores plasticity to RGS14-expressing neurons. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that RGS14 regulates plasticity in hippocampal area CA2 by restricting Ca2+ elevations in CA2 spines and downstream signaling pathways.\n\nSignificance StatementRecent studies of hippocampal area CA2 have provided strong evidence in support of a clear role for this apparently plasticity-resistant subregion of the hippocampus in social, spatial, and temporal aspects of memory. Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a critical factor that inhibits synaptic plasticity in CA2, but the molecular mechanisms by which RGS14 limits LTP remained unknown. Here we provide new evidence that RGS14 restricts spine calcium (Ca2+) in CA2 neurons and that key downstream Ca2+-activated signaling pathways are required for CA2 plasticity in mice lacking RGS14. These results define a previously unrecognized role for RGS14 as a natural inhibitor of postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling in hippocampal area CA2.","10.1523/ENEURO.0353-17.2018"

Martin","University of Cambridge","2018-04-08",1,"1","new results","evolutionary biology","Hybridisation and introgression can dramatically alter the relationships among groups of species, leading to phylogenetic discordance across the genome and between populations. Introgression can also erode species differences over time, but selection against introgression at certain loci acts to maintain post-mating species barriers. Theory predicts that species barriers made up of many loci throughout the genome should lead to a broad correlation between introgression and recombination rate, which determines the extent to which selection on deleterious foreign alleles will affect neutral alleles at physically linked loci. Here we describe the variation in genealogical relationships across the genome among three species of Heliconius butterflies: H. melpomene, H. cydno and H. timareta, using whole genomes of 92 individuals, and ask whether this variation can be explained by heterogeneous barriers to introgression. We find that species relationships vary predictably at the chromosomal scale. By quantifying recombination rate and admixture proportions, we then show that rates of introgression are predicted by variation in recombination rate. This implies that species barriers are highly polygenic, with selection acting against introgressed alleles across most of the genome. In addition, long chromosomes, which have lower recombination rates, produce stronger barriers on average than short chromosomes. Finally, we find a consistent difference between two species pairs on either side of the Andes, which suggests differences in the architecture of the species barriers. Our findings illustrate how the combined effects of hybridisation, recombination and natural selection, acting at multitudes of loci over long periods, can dramatically sculpt the phylogenetic relationships among species.","10.1371/journal.pbio.2006288"

Using transcriptome sequencing, we found that the abrogation of ESX-1 function in Mycobacterium marinum leads to a pronounced increase in gene expression levels of the espA operon during the infection of macrophages, suggesting an important role in ESX-1-mediated virulence during the early phase of infection. In addition, the disruption of ESX-1-mediated protein secretion also leads to a specific down-regulation of the ESX-1 substrates, but not of the structural components of this system, during growth in culture medium. This effect is observed in both M. marinum and M. tuberculosis. We established that down-regulation of ESX-1 substrates is the result of a regulatory process that is influenced by the putative transcriptional regulator whib6, which is located adjacent to the esx-1 locus. In addition, the overexpression of the ESX-1-associated PE35/PPE68 protein pair resulted in a significantly increased secretion of the ESX-1 substrate EsxA, demonstrating a functional link between these proteins. Taken together, these data show that WhiB6 is required for the secretion-dependent regulation of ESX-1 substrates and that ESX-1 substrates are regulated independently from the structural components, both during infection and as a result of active secretion.","NA"

Our massive experience with such positional regularities prompts the hypothesis that the processing of individual objects varies in efficiency across the visual field: when objects are encountered in their typical locations (e.g., we are used to seeing lamps in the upper visual field and carpets in the lower visual field), they should be more efficiently perceived than when they are encountered in atypical locations (e.g., a lamp in the lower visual field and a carpet in the upper visual field). Here, we provide evidence for this hypothesis by showing that typical positioning facilitates an objects access to awareness. In two continuous flash suppression experiments, objects more efficiently overcame inter-ocular suppression when they were presented in visual-field locations that matched their typical locations in the environment, as compared to non-typical locations. This finding suggests that through extensive experience the visual system has adapted to the statistics of the environment.

Furthermore, we establish that predictive remapping also occurs for stimuli that are not saccade targets, pointing toward a  forward remapping process operating across the whole visual field.

Mad1-Mad2 first catalyzes MCC assembly at interphase nuclear pores [3], then migrates to kinetochores at nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and resumes MCC assembly until bipolar spindle attachment is complete [1, 2]. There is significant debate about the factor(s) involved in targeting Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores in higher eukaryotes [4-9]. Through gene editing and live-cell imaging, we found that the human Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex is dispensable for cell viability and initial recruitment of Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores at NEBD, but then becomes necessary to tether Mad1-Mad2 at kinetochores and sustain SAC arrest in cells challenged with spindle poisons. We also show that RZZ forms the mesh-like fibrous corona, a structural expansion of the outer kinetochore important for timely chromosome congression [10-13] once Mps1 phosphorylates the N-terminus of Rod. Artificially tethering Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores enabled long-term mitotic arrest in the absence of RZZ. Conversely, blocking early RZZ-independent recruitment of Mad1-Mad2 eliminated the transient SAC response in RZZ-null cells. We conclude that RZZ drives structural changes in the outer kinetochore that facilitate chromosome bi-orientation and chronic SAC transduction, a key determinant of cytotoxicity during anti-mitotic drug therapy [14-16].","NA"

However, for non-model organisms genome assemblies and annotations are often not available or have inferior quality, biasing the inference of expression changes to an unknown extent. Here, we explore the possibility to map RNA-seq reads from diverged species to one high quality reference genome. As test case, we used a small primate phylogeny ranging from Human to Marmoset spanning 12% nucleotide divergence. To distinguish the effect of sequence divergence and genome quality, we used in silico evolved genomes and existing genomes to simulate RNA-seq reads. These were then mapped to the genome of origin (self-mapping) as well as to one common reference (cross-mapping) to infer the quantification biases. We find that the bias due to cross-mapping is small for the closely related great apes ([&le;] 4% divergence), and preferable to self-mapping given current genome qualities. For closely related species, cross-mapping provides easy access, high power and a well controlled false discovery rate for both; the analysis of intra-species expression differences as well as the detection of relative differences between species. If divergence increases, so that a substantial fraction of reads exceeds the limits of the mapper used, we find that gene-specific corrections and effect-size cutoffs can limit the bias before self-mapping becomes unavoidable. In summary, for the first time we systematically quantify biases in cross-species RNA-seq studies, providing guidance to best practices for these important evolutionary studies.","NA"

Zebrafish models have advantages in that transgenes can be rapidly tested by mosaic expression, but these typically lack spatial and temporal control of tumor onset, which limits their utility for the study of tumor progression and metastasis. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a method called Transgene Electroporation in Adult Zebrafish (TEAZ). TEAZ can deliver DNA constructs with promoter elements of interest to drive fluorophores, oncogenes, or CRISPR-Cas9-based mutagenic cassettes in specific cell types. Using TEAZ, we created a highly aggressive melanoma model by expression of BRAFV600E in spatially constrained melanocytes in the context of p53 deficiency and Cas9-mediated inactivation of Rb1. Unlike prior models that take ~4 months to develop, we found that TEAZ leads to tumor onset in ~7 weeks and these develop in fully immunocompetent animals. As the resulting tumors initiated at highly defined locations, we could track their progression via fluorescence and documented deep invasion into tissues and metastatic deposits. TEAZ can be deployed to other tissues and cell types such as the heart with the use of suitable transgenic promoters. The versatility of TEAZ makes it widely accessible for rapid modeling of somatic gene alterations and cancer progression at a scale not achievable in other in vivo systems.","10.1242/dmm.034561"

During its inchworm motion driven by ATP consumption, the remodeler overwrites the original nucleosome energy landscape via steric and electrostatic interactions to induce sliding of nucleosomal DNA. Repositioning is initiated at the remodeler binding location via the generation of twist defects, which then spontaneously propagate to complete sliding throughout the entire nucleosome.

The rhythmicity of this process is controlled by travelling waves of gene expression. These kinetic waves emerge from coupled cellular oscillators and sweep across the PSM. In zebrafish, the oscillations are driven by autorepression of her genes and are synchronized via Notch signalling. Mathematical modelling has played an important role in explaining how collective properties emerge from the molecular interactions. Increasingly more quantitative experimental data permits the validation of those mathematical models, yet leads to increasingly more complex model formulations that hamper an intuitive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we review previous efforts, and design a mechanistic model of the her1 oscillator, which represents the experimentally viable her7;hes6 double mutant. This genetically simplified system is ideally suited to conceptually recapitulate oscillatory entrainment and travelling wave formation, and to highlight open questions. It shows that three key parameters, the autorepression delay, the juxtacrine coupling delay, and the coupling strength, are sufficient to understand the emergence of the collective period, the collective amplitude, and the synchronization of neighbouring Her1 oscillators. Moreover, two spatiotemporal time delay gradients, in the autorepression and in the juxtacrine signalling, are required to explain the collective oscillatory dynamics and synchrony of PSM cells. The highlighted developmental principles likely apply more generally to other developmental processes, including neurogenesis and angiogenesis.","10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2018.04.004"

Yet the role of its close relative Rap1 (Ras Proximal), which shares 100% identity between their core effector binding sequences, remains unclear. A long-standing controversy in the field is whether Rap1 also functions to activate the canonical Ras effector, the S/T kinase Raf. We used the developmentally simpler Caenorhabditis elegans, which lacks the extensive paralog redundancy of vertebrates, to examine the role of RAP-1 in two distinct LET-60/Ras-dependent cell fate patterning events: induction of 1{ring} vulval precursor cell (VPC) fate and of the excretory duct cell. Fluorescently tagged endogenous RAP-1 is localized to plasma membranes and is expressed ubiquitously, with even expression levels across the VPCs. RAP-1 and its activating GEF PXF-1 function cell autonomously and are necessary for maximal induction of 1{ring} VPCs. Critically, mutationally activated endogenous RAP-1 is sufficient both to induce ectopic 1{ring}s and duplicate excretory duct cells. Like endogenous RAP-1, before induction GFP expression from the pxf-1 promoter is uniform across VPCs. However, unlike endogenous RAP-1, after induction GFP expression is increased in presumptive 1{ring}s and decreased in presumptive 2{ring}s. We conclude that RAP-1 is a positive regulator that promotes Ras-dependent inductive fate decisions.

Remarkably, the distribution of , is extremely broad suggestive of highly heterogeneous dynamics, which is also reflected in the large cell-to-cell variations in the contact maps. Chromosome organization is hierarchical involving the formation of chromosome droplets (CDs) on short genomic scale followed by coalescence of the CDs, reminiscent of Ostwald ripening. We propose that glassy landscapes for the condensed active chromosomes might provide a balance between genomic conformational stability and biological functions.","10.1038/s41467-018-05606-6"

This biodiversity is highly threatened by anthropogenic deforestation. Existing historical forest maps at national level are scattered and have substantial gaps which prevent an exhaustive assessment of long-term deforestation trends in Madagascar. In this study, we combined historical national forest cover maps (covering the period 1953-2000) with a recent global annual tree cover loss dataset (2001-2014) to look at six decades of deforestation and forest fragmentation in Madagascar (from 1953 to 2014). We produced new forest cover maps at 30 m resolution for the year 1990 and annually from 2000 to 2014 over the full territory of Madagascar. We estimated that Madagascar has lost 44% of its natural forest cover over the period 1953-2014 (including 37% over the period 1973-2014). Natural forests cover 8.9 Mha in 2014 (15% of the national territory) and include 4.4 Mha (50%) of moist forests, 2.6 Mha (29%) of dry forests, 1.7 Mha of spiny forests (19%) and 177,000 ha (2%) of mangroves. Since 2005, the annual deforestation rate has progressively increased in Madagascar to reach 99,000 ha/yr during 2010-2014 (corresponding to a rate of 1.1%/yr). Around half of the forest (46%) is now located at less than 100 m from the forest edge. Our approach could be replicated to other developing countries with tropical forest. Accurate forest cover change maps can be used to assess the effectiveness of past and current conservation programs and implement new strategies for the future. In particular, forest maps and estimates can be used in the REDD+ framework which aims at \""Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation\"" and for optimizing the current protected area network.","10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.008"

Using a Drosophila model, we show that the piRNA pathway provides a strong germline-specific mechanism of telomere homeostasis. We show that telomeric retrotransposon arrays belong to a unique class of dual-strand piRNA clusters whose transcripts, required for telomere elongation, serve simultaneously as piRNA precursors and their only targets. However, the ability to produce piRNAs and bind Rhino - a germline-specific homolog of heterochromatic protein 1 (HP1) - varies along telomeres. Most likely, this heterogeneity is determined by the peculiarities of telomeric retrotransposons themselves. piRNAs play a pivotal role in the establishment and maintenance of telomeric and subtelomeric chromatin in the germline facilitating loading of HP1 and histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation mark - highly conservative telomere components - at different telomeric regions. piRNA pathway disruption results in telomere dysfunction characterized by a loss of heterochromatic components and translocation of telomeres from the periphery to the nuclear interior but does not affect the telomere end capping.","10.1186/s13072-018-0210-4"

We demonstrated that chromatin is accessible at the risk locus, a prerequisite for its impact on astroglial function. The risk variant was associated with increased NF-{kappa}B signaling and target gene expression driving lymphocyte recruitment in cultured human astrocytes and astrocytes within MS lesions, and with increased lesional lymphocytic infiltrates.

Theory predicts that evolution in complex environments selects for modular genetic architectures and high recombination rates among loci shaped by different sources of selection. However, limited data exist to test these predictions because the field lacks consensus for how to control for intercorrelated environmental variables. Here, we introduce a co-association network analysis, which clusters loci based on differing environmental associations, and use it to study the genetic architecture of local adaptation to climate in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta).\n\nResultsWe identified many modules of genes associated with distinct environments (aridity, freezing, geography), and discovered low recombination rates among some candidate genes in different modules. We observed limited evidence for environmental pleiotropic effects on distinct aspects of climate. We also found limited correspondence between the modularity of co-association networks and gene regulatory networks. We compared co-association networks to associations with principal components, and found the latter can lead to misinterpretation. Finally, we used simulations to illustrate the benefits and caveats of co-association networks.\n\nConclusionsCo-association networks provided a useful framework for studying modularity. Our results supported the prediction that evolution to complex environments selects for modular genetic architectures, but some of our results went against the prediction that selection would increase recombination among loci experiencing different sources of selection.

However, compared to bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell expression profiles are extremely noisy, as they only capture a fraction of the transcripts present in the cell. Here, we propose the k-nearest neighbor smoothing (kNN-smoothing) algorithm, designed to reduce noise by aggregating information from similar cells (neighbors) in a computationally efficient and statistically tractable manner. The algorithm is based on the observation that across protocols, the technical noise exhibited by UMI-filtered scRNA-Seq data closely follows Poisson statistics. Smoothing is performed by first identifying the nearest neighbors of each cell in a step-wise fashion, based on partially smoothed and variance-stabilized expression profiles, and then aggregating their transcript counts. We show that kNN-smoothing greatly improves the detection of clusters of cells and co-expressed genes, and clearly outperforms other smoothing methods on simulated data. To accurately perform smoothing for datasets containing highly similar cell populations, we propose the kNN-smoothing 2 algorithm, in which neighbors are determined after projecting the partially smoothed data onto the first few principal components. We show that unlike its predecessor, kNN-smoothing 2 can accurately distinguish between cells from different T cell subsets, and enables their identification in peripheral blood using unsupervised methods. Our work facilitates the analysis of scRNA-Seq data across a broad range of applications, including the identification of cell populations in heterogeneous tissues and the characterization of dynamic processes such as cellular differentiation.

Here, we aimed to estimate a lower temporal bound for the emergence of conceptual representations by defining two criteria that characterize such representations: 1) conceptual object representations should generalize across different exemplars of the same object, and 2) these representations should reflect high-level behavioral judgments. To test these criteria, we compared magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings between two groups of participants (n = 16 per group) exposed to different exemplar images of the same object concepts. Further, we disentangled low-level from high-level MEG responses by estimating the unique and shared contribution of models of behavioral judgments, semantics, and different layers of deep neural networks of visual object processing. We find that 1) both generalization across exemplars as well as generalization of object-related signals across time increase after 150 ms, peaking around 230 ms; 2) behavioral judgments explain the most unique variance in the response after 150 ms. Collectively, these results suggest a lower bound for the emergence of conceptual object representations around 150 ms following stimulus onset.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.05.037"

These physiological changes are observed within minutes of encountering a stressor and the rapid time domain rules out genomic responses that require gene expression changes. Although behavioral changes corresponding to physiological changes are commonly observed, it is not clearly understood to what extent HPA axis activation dictates adaptive behavior. We hypothesized that rapid locomotor response to acute stressors in zebrafish requires HPI axis activation. In teleost fish, interrenal cells (I) are functionally homologous to the adrenal gland cortical layer. We derived 8 frameshift mutants in genes involved in HPI axis function: two mutants in exon 2 of mc2r (adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor), two in each of exon 2 and exon 5 of nr3c1 (glucocorticoid receptor), and two in exon 2 of nr3c2 (mineralocorticoid receptor). Exposing larval zebrafish to mild environmental stressors, acute changes in salinity or light illumination, results in a rapid locomotor response.

GBM tumors are characterized by diffuse infiltration, with tumor cells invading slowly through the hyaluronic acid (HA)-rich parenchyma toward vascular beds and then migrating rapidly along microvasculature. Progress in understanding local infiltration, vascular homing, and perivascular invasion is limited by an absence of culture models that recapitulate these hallmark processes. Here we introduce a platform for GBM invasion consisting of a tumor-like cell reservoir and a parallel open channel \""vessel\"" embedded in 3D HA-RGD matrix. We show that this simple paradigm is sufficient to capture multi-step invasion and transitions in cell morphology and speed reminiscent of those seen in GBM. Specifically, seeded tumor cells grow into multicellular masses that expand and invade the surrounding HA-RGD matrices while extending long (10-100 {micro}m), thin protrusions resembling those observed for GBM in vivo. Upon encountering the channel, cells orient along the channel wall, adopt a 2D-like morphology, and migrate rapidly along the channel. Structured illumination microscopy reveals distinct cytoskeletal architectures for cells invading through the HA matrix versus those migrating along the vascular channel. Substitution of collagen I in place of HA-RGD supports the same sequence of events but with faster local invasion and a more mesenchymal morphology. These results indicate that topographical effects are generalizable across matrix formulations, but that mechanisms underlying invasion are matrix-dependent.

In extreme cases, selection for mutational robustness can lead to \""flat\"" genotypes (with low fitness but high robustness) out-competing \""fit\"" genotypes with high fitness but low robustness--a phenomenon known as \""survival of the flattest\"". While this effect was previously explored using the digital evolution system Avida, a complete analysis of the local fitness landscapes of \""fit\"" and \""flat\"" genotypes has been lacking, leading to uncertainty about the genetic basis of the survival of the flattest effect.\n\nResultsHere, we repeated the survival of the flattest study and analyzed the mutational neighborhoods of fit and flat genotypes. We found that flat genotypes, compared to the fit genotypes, had a reduced likelihood of deleterious mutations as well as an increased likelihood of neutral and, surprisingly, of lethal mutations. This trend holds for mutants one to four substitutions away from the wild-type sequence. We also found that flat genotypes have, on average, no epistasis between mutations, while fit genotypes have, on average, positive epistasis.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate that the genetic causes of mutational robustness on complex fitness landscapes are multifaceted. While the traditional idea of the survival of the flattest effect emphasized the evolution of increased neutrality, others have argued for increased mutational sensitivity in response to strong mutational loads. Our results show that both increased neutrality and increased lethality can lead to the evolution of mutational robustness. Furthermore, strong negative epistasis is not required for mutational sensitivity to lead to mutational robustness.

More recently, another RNA-guided CRISPR endonuclease called Cpf1 (also known as Cas12a) was identified and is also being repurposed. Little is known about the kinetics and mechanism of Cpf1 DNA interaction and how sequence mismatches between the DNA target and guide-RNA influence this interaction. We have used single-molecule fluorescence analysis and biochemical assays to characterize DNA interrogation, cleavage, and product release by three Cpf1 orthologues. Our Cpf1 data are consistent with the DNA interrogation mechanism proposed for Cas9, they both bind any DNA in search of PAM (protospacer-adjacent motif) sequences, verifies the target sequence directionally from the PAM-proximal end and rapidly rejects any targets that lack a PAM or that are poorly matched with the guide-RNA. Unlike Cas9, which requires 9 bp for stable binding and ~16 bp for cleavage, Cpf1 requires ~ 17 bp sequence match for both stable binding and cleavage. Unlike Cas9, which does not release the DNA cleavage products, Cpf1 rapidly releases the PAM-distal cleavage product, but not the PAM-proximal product. Solution pH, reducing conditions and 5 guanine in guide-RNA differentially affected different Cpf1 orthologues. Our findings have important implications on Cpf1-based genome engineering and manipulation applications.","10.1073/pnas.1718686115"

This caused extension rates of nearshore colonies to converge with their historically slower-growing offshore conspecifics. Bleaching events negatively impacted extension rates in S. siderea but not in P. strigosa. The more negative trend in linear extension for nearshore versus offshore colonies may arise from ocean warming combined with stronger land-based anthropogenic stressors within nearshore environments.

Conservation Laws and Integrable Systems in Ecology.","O'Dwyer, J.","James O'Dwyer","University of Illinois","2018-04-09",1,"4","new results","ecology","Competition in ecology is often modeled in terms of direct, negative effects of one individual on another. An example is logistic growth, modeling the effects of intraspecific competition, while the Lotka-Volterra equations for competition extend this to systems of multiple species, with varying strengths of intra- and inter-specific competition. These equations are a classic and well-used staple of quantitative ecology, providing a framework to understand species interactions, species coexistence, and community assembly. They can be derived from an assumption of random mixing of organisms, and an outcome of each interaction that removes one or more individuals. However, this framing is some-what unsatisfactory, and ecologists may prefer to think of phenomenological equations for competition as deriving from competition for a set of resources required for growth, which in turn may undergo their own complex dynamics. While it is intuitive that these frameworks are connected, and the connection is well-understood near to equilibria, here we ask the question: when can consumer dynamics alone become an exact description of a full system of consumers and resources? We identify that consumer-resource systems with this property must have some kind of redundancy in the original description, or equivalently there is one or more conservation laws for quantities that do not change with time. Such systems are known in mathematics as integrable systems. We suggest that integrability in consumer-resource dynamics can only arise in cases where each species in an assemblage requires a distinct and unique combination of resources, and even in these cases it is not clear that the resulting dynamics will lead to Lotka-Volterra competition.\n\nI acknowledge the Simons Foundation Grant #376199 and the McDonnell Foundation Grant #220020439.","10.1007/s12080-018-0377-0"

In the present study, bias and accuracy of GEBV were explored for various genetic models and prediction methods when using selected individuals for a reference. Data were simulated for an animal breeding program to compare Best Linear Unbiased Prediction of breeding values using pedigree based relationships (PBLUP), genomic relationships for genotyped animals only (GBLUP) and a Single Step approach (SSGBLUP), where information on genotyped individuals was used to infer a matrix H with relationships among all available genotyped and non-genotyped individuals that were linked through pedigree. In SSGBLUP, various weights (=0.95, 0.80, 0.50) for the genomic relationship matrix (G) relative to the numerator relationship matrix (A) were applied to construct H and in another version (SSGBLUP_F), inbreeding was accounted for while computing A-1. With GBLUP, accuracy of GEBV prediction increased linearly with an increase in the number of animals selected in reference. For the scenario with no-selection and random mating (RR) prediction was unbiased. For GBLUP, lower accuracy and bias observed in the scenarios with selection and random mating (SR) or selection and positive assortative mating (SA), in which prediction bias increased when a smaller and highly selected proportion genotyped. Bias disappeared when all individuals were genotyped. SSGBLUP_F showed higher accuracy compared to GBLUP and bias of prediction was negligible even with selective genotyping. However, PBLUP and SSGBLUP showed bias in SA owing to not fully accounting for allele frequency changes because of selection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with larger effects and also due to high inbreeding rate. In genetic models with fewer QTL but each with larger effect, predictions were less accurate and more biased for selection scenarios. Results suggest that prediction accuracy and bias is affected by the genetic architecture of the trait. Selective genotyping lead to significant bias in GEBV prediction. SSGBLUP with appropriate scaling of A and G matrices can provide accurate and less biased prediction but scaling requires careful consideration in populations under selection and with high levels of inbreeding.","NA"

Both RBPs repress splicing and 3 end processing within and around LINEs, as demonstrated in cultured human cells and mouse brain. Notably, repressive RBPs preferentially bind to evolutionarily young LINEs, which are confined to deep intronic regions. These RBPs insulate both LINEs and surrounding regions from RNA processing. Upon evolutionary divergence, gradual loss of insulation diversifies the roles of LINEs. Older LINEs are located closer to exons, are a common source of tissue-specific exons, and increasingly bind to RBPs that enhance RNA processing.

In order to mimic a well-characterised stress situation, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to poor water quality (hypoxia combined with high ammonia level) for three weeks (stressed group, S) and compared to a non-stressed control group (NS). After a return to water quality standard, emotional responses were assessed in fish subjected to two potentially threatening situations: (i) social isolation in a novel environment and (ii) human presence. In addition, we used an appetitive-conditioning paradigm to determine whether previous chronic deterioration of water quality disturbs cognitive abilities in fish. Spontaneous behaviour in the tanks was also recorded during the environmental challenge as a reference for fish activity. We observed that in S fish, plasma cortisol levels were increased before and after social isolation in a novel environment compared to the plasma cortisol levels in the NS group, despite the absence of a behavioural difference between the two groups. Under deteriorated water quality, fish locomotor activity was globally reduced and this reduction was correlated to increased shoaling behaviour. Farmers can use these first behavioural modifications as a sentinel detector for fish welfare impairment. More importantly, we demonstrated that reactivity to a human presence in a home-environment and food-anticipatory behaviour were both inhibited in the S group. We consider that these two sentience-based tests are highly relevant for fish welfare assessment at the group level and are easy to use in the aquaculture industry.","10.1016/j.applanim.2018.10.010"

The KDM5 family of proteins are histone H3 lysine 4 demethylases that can regulate transcription through both demethylase-dependent and independent mechanisms. While loss and overexpression of KDM5 proteins are linked to intellectual disability and cancer, respectively, their normal developmental functions remain less characterized. Drosophila melanogaster provides an ideal system to investigate KDM5 function, as it encodes a single ortholog in contrast to the four paralogs found in mammalian cells. To examine the consequences of complete loss of KDM5, we generated a null allele of Drosophila kdm5, also known as little imaginal discs (lid), and show that it is essential for development. Animals lacking KDM5 die during late pupal development but show a dramatically delayed larval development that coincides with decreased proliferation and increased cell death in imaginal discs. Interestingly, this developmental delay is independent of the well-characterized Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-encoded histone demethylase activity and plant homedomain (PHD) motif-mediated chromatin binding activities of KDM5, suggesting key functions for less characterized domains. Consistent with the phenotypes observed, transcriptome analyses of kdm5 null mutant wing imaginal discs revealed the dysregulation of genes involved in several cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Together, our data provide the first description of complete loss of KDM5 function in a metazoan and offer an invaluable tool for defining the biological activities of KDM5 family proteins.","10.1534/genetics.118.301004"

Here, we study the relationship between SC and FC and an array of psychological tasks in 609 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We identified several sets of connections that each uniquely map onto different aspects of cognitive function. We found a small number of distributed SC and a larger set of cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical FC that express this association.

Unexpectedly, many experiments have also shown decreased algal biomass on NDS P treatments compared to controls. To address whether inhibition of algal growth results from direct P toxicity, NDS preparation artifacts, or environmental covariates, we first quantified the frequency of nutrient inhibition in published experiments. We also conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether heterotrophic microbial competition or selective grazing could explain decreases in algal biomass with P additions. We then deployed field experiments to determine whether P-inhibition of algal growth could be explained by P toxicity, differences in phosphate cation (K vs. Na), differences in phosphate form (monobasic vs. dibasic), or production of H2O2 during NDS preparation. We found significant inhibition of algal growth in 12.9% of published NDS P experiments as compared to 4.7% and 3.6% of N and NP experiments. The meta-analysis did not show enhanced heterotrophy on NDS P treatments or selective grazing of P-rich algae. Our field experiments did not show inhibition of autotrophic growth with P additions, but we found significantly lower gross primary productivity (GPP) and biomass-specific GPP of benthic algae on monobasic phosphate salts as compared to dibasic phosphate salts, likely because of reduced pH levels. Additionally, we note that past field experiments and meta-analyses support the plausibility of direct P toxicity or phosphate form (monobasic vs. dibasic) leading to inhibition of algal growth, particularly when other resources such as N or light are limiting. Given that multiple mechanisms may be acting simultaneously, we recommend practical, cost-effective steps to minimize the potential for P-inhibition of algal growth as an artifact of NDS experimental design.","10.1371/journal.pone.0205684"

In an era of unprecedented biodiversity loss and climate change, understanding both the determinants and consequences of bottlenecks in wild populations is therefore an increasingly important challenge. However, as most studies have focused on single species, the multitude of potential drivers and the consequences of bottlenecks remain elusive. Here, we used a comparative approach by integrating genetic data from over 11,000 individuals of 30 pinniped species with demographic, ecological and life history data to elucidate the consequences of large-scale commercial exploitation by 18th and 19th century sealers. We show that around one third of these species exhibit strong genetic signatures of recent population declines, with estimated bottleneck effective population sizes reflecting just a few tens of surviving individuals in the most extreme cases. Bottleneck strength was strongly associated with both breeding habitat and mating system variation, and together with global abundance explained a large proportion of the variation in genetic diversity across species. Overall, there was no relationship between bottleneck intensity and IUCN status, although three of the four most heavily bottlenecked species are currently endangered. Our study reveals an unforeseen interplay between anthropogenic exploitation, ecology, life history and demographic declines, sheds new light on the determinants of genetic diversity, and is consistent with the notion that both genetic and demographic factors influence population viability.","10.1038/s41467-018-06695-z"

The ecological implications of body size extend from the biology of individual organisms to ecosystem-level processes. Measuring body mass for high numbers of invertebrates can be logistically challenging, making length-mass regressions useful for predicting body mass with minimal effort. However, standardised sets of scaling relationships covering a large range in body length, taxonomic groups, and multiple geographical regions are scarce.\n\n2. We collected 6293 arthropods from 19 higher-level taxa in both temperate and tropical locations to compile a comprehensive set of linear models relating live body mass to a range of predictor variables. For each individual, we measured live weight (hereafter, body mass), body length and width, and conducted linear regressions to predict body mass using body length, body width, taxonomic group and geographic region. Additionally, we quantified prediction error when using parameters from arthropods of a different geographic region.\n\n3. Incorporating body width into taxon- and region-specific length-mass regressions yielded the highest prediction accuracy for body mass. Using regression parameters from a different geographic location increased prediction error, causing over- or underestimation of body mass depending on geographical origin and whether body width was included.\n\n4. We present a comprehensive range of parameters for predicting arthropod body mass and provide guidance for selecting optimal scaling relationships.

Relying on compacted De Bruijn graphs (cDBG), our method gathers cDBG nodes identified by the association model into subgraphs defined from their neighbourhood in the initial cDBG. DBGWAS is fast, alignment-free and only requires a set of contigs and phenotypes. It produces annotated subgraphs representing local polymorphisms as well as mobile genetic elements (MGE) and offers a graphical framework to interpret GWAS results.\n\nResultsWe validated our method using antibiotic resistance phenotypes for three bacterial species. DBGWAS recovered known resistance determinants such as mutations in core genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and genes acquired by horizontal transfer in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - along with their MGE context.

Consistent with the pathogenic effect of MDM4 upregulation in BL, we found that TP53wt BL samples were enriched for gain of chromosome 1q which includes the MDM4 locus. 1q gain was also enriched across non-BL cancer cell lines (n=789) without TP53 mutation (23% in TP53wt and 12% in TP53mut, p<0.001).

Cellular models have great value for studying oxidative damage, which would be significantly promoted if non-invasive approaches for predicting oxidative damage can be established without the need of exogenous probes. In our current study, we tested our hypothesis that changes of the autofluorescence (AF) of cells may be used for predicting oxidative cellular damage. Our study found that H2O2 dose-dependently increased the green AF of HaCaT keratinocyte cell line at non-nuclear regions assessed at 1 hr or 3 hrs after the H2O2 exposures, while H2O2 did not affect the green AF of other cell types tested in our study, including PC 12 cells and BV2 microglia. We further found that the increases in the AF of HaCaT cells are highly correlated with the H2O2-induced increases in early-stage apoptosis, late-stage apoptosis and necrosis assessed at 18 hrs after the H2O2 exposures, which are also negatively correlated with the intracellular ATP levels of the H2O2-treated cells assessed at 18 hrs after the H2O2 exposures. Collectively, our study has suggested that increased AF may become the first endogenous marker for non-invasive prediction of oxidative damage selectively for such cell types as HaCaT cells.

A traditional model suggests that memory cells use mitochondrial respiration and are survivors from a pool of previously proliferating and glycolytic, but short-lived effector cells. A more recent model proposes a binary commitment to either a memory or effector cell lineage during a first, asymmetric cell division, with each lineage able to undergo subsequent proliferation and differentiation. We used improved fixation and staining methods with imaging flow cytometry in an optimised in vitro system that indicates a third model. We found that cell fates result from stochastic decisions that depend on GITR co-stimulation and which take place before any cell division. Effector cell commitment is associated with mTORC2 signalling leading to uropodium development, while developing memory cells lose mitochondria, have a nuclear localization of NF{kappa}B and depend on TGF{beta} for their survival.

The specific requirements of MKK4 and MKK7 in retinal development and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death after axonal injury, however, are currently undefined. Optic nerve injury is an important insult in many neurologic conditions including traumatic, ischemic, inflammatory, and glaucomatous optic neuropathies. Mice deficient in Mkk4, Mkk7, and both Mkk4 and Mkk7 were generated. Immunohistochemistry was used to study the distribution and structure of retinal cell types and to assess RGC survival after optic nerve injury (mechanical controlled optic nerve crush; CONC). Adult Mkk4 and Mkk7 deficient retinas had all retinal cell types. With the exception of small areas of lamination defects with photoreceptors in Mkk4 deficient mice, the retinas of both mutants were grossly normal. Deficiency of Mkk4 or Mkk7 reduced JNK signaling after axonal injury in RGCs. Mkk4 and Mkk7 deficient retinas had a significantly greater percentage of surviving RGCs 35 days after CONC as compared to wildtype controls (Mkk4: 51.5%, Mkk7: 29.1% WT: 15.2%; p<0.001). Combined deficiency of Mkk4 and Mkk7 caused failure of optic nerve formation, irregular retinal axonal trajectories, disruption of retinal lamination, clumping of RGC cell bodies, and dendritic fasciculation of dopaminergic amacrine cells.

We developed an original theoretical framework in order to interrogate how this competition constrains the behavior of proteins with respect to their partners or random encounters. Our theoretical framework relies on a two-dimensional (2D) representation of interaction energy landscapes with 2D energy maps that reflect in a synthetic way the propensity of a protein to interact with another protein. We investigated the propensity of protein surfaces to interact with functional and arbitrary partners and asked whether their interaction propensity is conserved during the evolution. Therefore, we performed several thousands of cross-docking simulations to systematically characterize the whole energy landscapes of 74 proteins interacting with different sets of homologs, corresponding to their functional partners family or arbitrary protein families. Then, we systematically compared the energy maps resulting from the docking of a given protein with the different protein families of the dataset. Strikingly, we show that the interaction propensity not only of the binding site but also of the rest of the protein surface is conserved for docking partners belonging to the same protein family. Interestingly, this observation holds for docked proteins corresponding to true but also to arbitrary partners. Our theoretical framework enables the characterization of the energy behavior of a protein in interaction with hundreds of selected partners and opens the way for further developments to study the behavior of proteins in a specific environment.","10.1016/j.jmb.2019.12.047"

Here, we demonstrate the power of combining targeted sequence capture with long-read sequencing technology for comparative genomic analyses of the hemoglobin (Hb) gene clusters across eight species separated by up to 70 million years. Guided by the reference genome assembly of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) together with genome information from draft assemblies of selected codfishes, we designed probes covering the two Hb gene clusters. Use of custom-made barcodes combined with PacBio RSII sequencing led to highly continuous assemblies of the LA (~100kb) and MN (~200kb) clusters, which include syntenic regions of coding and intergenic sequences. Our results revealed an overall conserved genetic organization and synteny of the Hb genes within this lineage, yet with several, lineage-specific gene duplications. Moreover, for some of the species examined, we identified amino acid substitutions at two sites in the Hbb1 gene as well as length polymorphisms in its regulatory region, which has previously been linked to temperature adaptation in Atlantic cod populations. This study highlights the use of targeted long-read capture as a versatile approach for comparative genomic studies by generation of a cross-species genomic resource elucidating the evolutionary history of the Hb gene family across the highly divergent group of codfishes.","10.1111/1755-0998.12955"

Through this period, almost nothing was known about driver mutations in cancers. Also, stem cells and cellular tissue organization were poorly characterized. The general multi-stage process was later confirmed by experimental studies, and cancer risk and incidence has been explained as primarily a function of mutation occurrence. However, the MMC has never been formally tested for its ability to account for current knowledge about cancer evolution. In particular, different numbers of cancer drivers required for different cancers and vast discrepancies in the organization of stem cell compartments for different tissues appear inconsistent with the very similar age distribution of the vast majority of cancers. In this regard, the initial theoretical idea underlying MMC is often over-interpreted with little connection to modern evidence, and a general theory of somatic evolution still does not exist. In this study, we applied Monte Carlo modeling and demonstrated the effect of various parameters, such as mutation rate, mutation effects and cell division, on the MMC performance. Our modeling demonstrates that the MMC requires considerable modification in order to describe cancer incidence. We elucidate the required conditions for how somatic cell selection should operate within the MMC in order to explain modern data on stem cell clonality and cancer, and propose a generalized theory of somatic evolution based on these results.","10.7554/eLife.39950"

The evolutionary success of influenza virus lineages depends on how these mutations affect HAs functionality and antigenicity. Here we experimentally measure the effects on viral growth in cell culture of all single amino-acid mutations to the HA from a recent human H3N2 influenza virus strain. We show that mutations that are measured to be more favorable for viral growth are enriched in evolutionarily successful H3N2 viral lineages relative to mutations that are measured to be less favorable for viral growth. Therefore, despite the well-known caveats about cell-culture measurements of viral fitness, such measurements can still be informative for understanding evolution in nature. We also compare our measurements for H3 HA to similar data previously generated for a distantly related H1 HA, and find substantial differences in which amino acids are preferred at many sites. For instance, the H3 HA has less disparity in mutational tolerance between the head and stalk domains than the H1 HA. Overall, our work suggests that experimental measurements of mutational effects can be leveraged to help understand the evolutionary fates of viral lineages in nature -- but only when the measurements are made on a viral strain similar to the ones being studied in nature.\n\nSignificance StatementA key goal in the study of influenza virus evolution is to forecast which viral strains will persist and which ones will die out. Here we experimentally measure the effects of all amino-acid mutations to the hemagglutinin protein from a human H3N2 influenza strain on viral growth in cell culture. We show that these measurements have utility for distinguishing among viral strains that do and do not succeed in nature. Overall, our work suggests that new high-throughput experimental approaches may be useful for understanding virus evolution in nature.","10.1073/pnas.1806133115"

In research cohorts, detailed neuropsychological test batteries are often administered to better understand how cognition changes over time. Understanding cognitive changes in dementia is of great importance, particularly in determining how structural changes in the brain may affect cognition and in facilitating earlier detection of symptomatic changes. Disease progression models are often applied to these data to understand how a disease changes over time from cross-sectional data or to disease trajectories from large numbers of individuals. Previous disease progression models used to build longitudinal models from cross-sectional data have focused on brain imaging data; however, these models are not directly applicable to cognitive data. Here we use the novel, non-parametric, Kernel Density Estimation Mixture Modelling (KDEMM) approach and demonstrate accurate modelling of the progression of cognitive test data. We found that using KDEMM resulted in more accurate models of disease progression in simulated data compared to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for the majority of parameters used to simulate the data. When comparing KDEMM and GMM to cognitive data collected in different Alzheimers Disease subtypes, we found the KDEMM resulted in a model much more in line with clinical phenotype. We anticipate that the KDEMM will be used to integrate cognitive test data, and other non-normally distributed datasets into complex disease progression models.","NA"

Here, we investigate the mechanism of active DNA sliding by remodelers, which underlies most remodeling functions, via molecular dynamics simulations of the Snf2 remodeler in complex with a nucleosome. During its inchworm motion driven by ATP consumption, the remodeler overwrites the original nucleosome energy landscape via steric and electrostatic interactions to induce sliding of nucleosomal DNA. Repositioning is initiated at the remodeler binding location via the generation of twist defects, which then spontaneously propagate to complete sliding throughout the entire nucleosome. We also reveal how remodeler mutations and DNA sequence control active nucleosome repositioning. These results offer a mechanistic understanding of chromatin remodeling important for the interpretation of experimental studies.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006512"

We examined whether pigeons and crows adjust their pecking to the visual distortion caused by prisms. We found that vision plays a role only before movement begins in pigeons, whereas crows may have more flexible visuomotor skills.\n\nABSTRACTPecking in birds is analogous to reaching and grasping movements in primates. Although pecking in pigeons is highly stereotypic, crows show dexterous pecking skills. To unveil what sensorimotor mechanisms underlie the flexibility of pecking in crows, the current study examined whether pigeons and crows adjust their pecking to the visual distortion induced by prisms. Because prisms induce visual shifts of object positions, birds were required to adjust their movements. Pecking kinematics were examined before and after attaching prisms in front of the birds eyes. As a result, crows showed faster adjustment of pecking trajectories than pigeons. Correlational analysis showed that the initial deviation of trajectory strongly influenced the subsequent deviation in pigeons, but not in crows. These results suggest that pecking in pigeons is controlled in a feedforward manner, and vision plays a role before movement initiation, although pecking in crows is under the on-line motor control, serving a possible mechanism for flexible visuomotor skills.","10.1242/jeb.182345"

The shelterin protein TPP1 is required for telomere stability and elongation, but its role in set point establishment remains elusive. Here, we characterize the contribution of TPP1 isoforms and residues outside the TEL patch, TPP1s telomerase interaction domain, to telomere length control. We demonstrate that TPP1L, the longer minor isoform of TPP1, can partially compensate for loss of the more abundant shorter isoform, TPP1S. Both TPP1S knockout and complete TPP1 knockout cell lines (TPP1 KO) show telomere shortening. However, TPP1S KO cells are able to stabilize short telomeres while TPP1 KO cells do not and die. We compare these phenotypes with that of TPP1L104A/L104A mutant cells that like the TPP1S KO have short stable telomeres. In contrast to TPP1S KO, TPP1L104A/L104A cells respond to increased telomerase. However, TPP1L104A/L104As sensitivity to shelterin-mediated feedback is altered, revealing TPP1L104A/L104A as a new type of shelterin mutant with aberrant set point regulation.","NA"

At present, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs or vaccines specific for LASV. Herein, high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library was performed against LASV entry using a pseudo-type virus enveloping LASV glycoproteins. Two hit drugs, lacidipine and phenothrin, were identified as LASV entry inhibitors in the micromolar range. A mechanistic study revealed that both drugs inhibited LASV entry by blocking low-pH-induced membrane fusion. Moreover, lacidipine irreversibly bound to the LASV glycoprotein complex (GPC), resulting in virucidal activity. Adaptive mutant analyses demonstrated that replacement of T40, located in the ectodomain of the stable-signal peptide (SSP), with lysine (K) conferred LASV resistance to lacidipine without apparent loss of the viral growth profile. Furthermore, lacidipine showed antiviral activity and specificity against both LASV and the Guanarito virus (GTOV), which is also a category A new world arenavirus. Drug-resistant variants indicate that the V36M in ectodomain of SSP mutant and V436A in the transmembrane domain of GP2 mutant conferred GTOV resistance to lacidipine, suggesting that lacidipine might act via a novel mechanism other than calcium inhibition. This study shows that both lacidipine and phenothrin are candidates for LASV therapy, and the membrane-proximal external region of the GPC might provide an entry-targeted platform for inhibitors.","10.1128/JVI.00954-18"

We sought to investigate the relationship between wrist position in the coronal plane and radiographic measurements of the scaphoid for each sex independently, then identify sex-specific differences in scaphoid measurements and calculated metrics.

We used Pearson correlation coefficients to explore the relationships between the degrees of wrist deviation in the coronal plane and radiographic scaphoid measurements for men and women independently. We used the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare values between sexes. The correlations between degrees of coronal wrist deviation and radiographic measurements of scaphoid inclination were significant only for men.

Expression of an efflux pump, an important mechanism of resistance to antibiotics, is usually associated with a fitness cost in bacteria. In this study, we aimed to determine why antibiotic resistance conferred by overexpression of an efflux pump persists in environments such as drinking and source water in which antibiotic selective pressure may be very low or even absent. Competition experiments between wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants revealed that the fitness cost of ciprofloxacin resistance (strains cip_1, cip_2, and cip_3) significantly decreased (P < 0.05) under low-nutrient (0.5 mg/l total organic carbon (TOC)) relative to high-nutrient (500 mg/l TOC) conditions. Mechanisms underlying this fitness cost were analyzed. MexD gene expression in resistant bacteria (cip_3 strain) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in low-nutrient conditions, with 10 mg/l TOC (8.01 {+/-} 0.82-fold), than in high-nutrient conditions, with 500 mg/l TOC (48.89 {+/-} 4.16-fold). Moreover, rpoS gene expression in resistant bacteria (1.36 {+/-} 0.13-fold) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that in the wild-type strain (2.78 {+/-} 0.29-fold) under low-nutrient conditions (10 mg/l TOC), suggesting a growth advantage. Furthermore, the difference in metabolic activity between the two competing strains was significantly smaller (P < 0.05) in low-nutrient conditions (5 and 0.5 mg/l TOC). These results suggest that nutrient levels are a key factor in determining the persistence and spread of antibiotic resistance conferred by efflux pumps in the natural environment with trace amounts or no antibiotics.\n\nImportanceThe widespread of antibiotic resistance has led to an increasing concern about the environmental and public health risks.

The mechanism of resistance to carbapenems has therapeutic and public health implications. We comprehensively characterized the underlying mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in CRE isolates recovered between 2013 and 2016 at a health system in Northern California. Genotypic methods were used to detect carbapenemases and plasmid-encoded cephalosporinases, and mass spectrometry was used to quantify relative porin levels for OmpC and OmpF and their analogs. MICs for imipenem-relebactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, and ceftolozane-tazobactam were measured. Whole genome sequencing was used for strain typing. A carbapenemase gene encoding blaOXA-48 like, blaNDM, blaKPC, blaSME, blaIMP, and blaVIM was detected in 38.7% (24/62) of CRE isolates. Porin levels was down at least 2-fold in 91.9% (57/62) of isolates. Including carbapenemase genes and porin loss, the mechanism of resistance was identified in 95.2% (59/62) of CRE isolates. Of the carbapenemase gene-positive isolates, blaKPC -positive isolates were 100% susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-relebactam; blaOXA-48 like-positive isolates were 100% susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam; and blaSME-positive isolates were 100% susceptible to meropenem-vaborbactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam. 100% (38/38), 92.1% (35/38), 89.5% (34/38), and 31.6% (12/38) of carbapenemase gene-negative CRE isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, and ceftolozane-tazobactam, respectively. None of the CRE strains were genetically identical. In conclusion, at this health system in Silicon Valley, carbapenemase-producing CRE occurred sporadically and were mediated by diverse mechanisms. Nucleic acid testing for blaOXA-48 like, blaNDM, blaKPC, blaIMP, and blaVIM was sufficient to distinguish between carbapenemase-producing and non-producing CRE and accurately predicted susceptibility to ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-relebactam.","NA"

GarKS production by the native producer Lactococcus garvieae KS1546 was however relatively low (80 BU/ml) under standard laboratory growth conditions (batch culture in GM17 at 30{degrees}C). To improve the production of GarKS, we systematically evaluated the impact of different media and media components on bacteriocin production. Based on the outcomes a new medium formulation was made to greatly improve bacteriocin production. The new medium composed of pasteurized milk and tryptone (PM-T), increased GarKS production about 60-fold compared to that achieved in GM17. GarKS production was increased further 4-fold (i.e., to 20,000 BU/ml) by increasing gene dose of the bacteriocin gene cluster (gak) in the native producer. Finally, a combination of the newly composed medium (PM-T), an increased gene dose and a cultivation at a constant pH 6 and a 50-60% dissolved oxygen level in growth medium, gave rise to a GarKS production of 164,000 BU/ml. This high production, which is about 2000-fold higher compared to that initially achieved in GM17, corresponds to a GarKS production of 1.2 g/L. To our knowledge, this is one of the highest bacteriocin production reported hitherto.\n\nImportanceLow bacteriocin production is a well-known bottle-neck in developing bacteriocins into large-scaled and useful applications. The present study shows different approaches that significantly improve bacteriocin production. This is an important research field to better exploit the antimicrobial potential of bacteriocins, especially with regard to the decreasing effect of antibiotics in infection treatments due to the global emergence of antibiotic resistance.","NA"

Kasumi-3 cells were infected with HCMV strain TB40/Ewt-GFP, flow sorted for GFP+ cells, and cultured for various times to monitor establishment of latency, as judged by repression of viral gene expression (RNA/DNA ratio) and loss of virus production. We found that, in the vast majority of cells, latency was established post-transcriptionally in the GFP+ infected cells: transcription was initially turned on, and then turned off. We also found that some of the GFP-cells were infected, suggesting that latency might be established in these cells at the outset of infection. We were not able to test this hypothesis because some GFP-cells expressed lytic genes, and thus, it was not possible to separate them from GFP-quiescent cells. In addition, we found that the pattern of expression of lytic genes that have been associated with latency, including UL138, US28, and RNA2.7, was the same as that of other lytic genes, indicating that there was no preferential expression of these genes once latency is established. We confirmed previous studies showing that TNF- induced reactivation of infectious virus, and by analyzing expression of the progenitor cell marker CD34 as well as myeloid cell differentiation markers in IE+ cells after treatment with TNF-, we showed that TNF- induced transcriptional reactivation of IE gene expression independently of differentiation. TNF--mediated reactivation in Kasumi-3 cells was correlated with activation of NF-{kappa}B, KAP-1 and ATM.\n\nIMPORTANCEHCMV is an important human pathogen that establishes lifelong latent infection in myeloid progenitor cells, and reactivates frequently to cause significant disease in immunocompromised people. Our observation that viral gene expression is first turned on, and then turned off to establish latency suggests that there is a host defense, which may be myeloid-specific, responsible for transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression. Our observation that TNF- induces reactivation independently of differentiation provides insight into molecular mechanisms that control reactivation.","NA"

Instead of passively observing the ongoing activity of a network, we can typically perturb its activity, either by external sensory stimulation or directly via techniques such as two-photon optogenetics. A natural question is how to use such perturbations to identify the connectivity of the network efficiently. Here we introduce a method to infer sparse connectivity graphs from in-vivo, two-photon imaging of population activity in response to external stimuli. A novel aspect of the work is the introduction of a recommended distribution, incrementally learned from the data, to optimally refine the inferred network.. Unlike existing system identification techniques, this \""active learning\"" method automatically focuses its attention on key undiscovered areas of the network, instead of targeting global uncertainty indicators like parameter variance. We show how active learning leads to faster inference while, at the same time, provides confidence intervals for the network parameters. We present simulations on artificial small-world networks to validate the methods and apply the method to real data.

The ability to explore human kinase biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology in the laboratory is essential to making rapid progress in understanding kinase regulation, designing selective inhibitors, and studying the emergence of drug resistance. While insect and mammalian expression systems are frequently used for the expression of human kinases, bacterial expression systems are superior in terms of simplicity and cost-effectiveness but have historically struggled with human kinase expression. Following the discovery that phosphatase coexpression could produce high yields of Src and Abl kinase domains in bacterial expression systems, we have generated a library of 52 His-tagged human kinase domain constructs that express above 2 {micro}g/mL culture in a simple automated bacterial expression system utilizing phosphatase coexpression (YopH for Tyr kinases, Lambda for Ser/Thr kinases). Here, we report a structural bioinformatics approach to identify kinase domain constructs previously expressed in bacteria likely to express well in a simple high-throughput protocol, experiments demonstrating our simple construct selection strategy selects constructs with good expression yields in a test of 84 potential kinase domain boundaries for Abl, and yields from a high-throughput expression screen of 96 human kinase constructs. Using a fluorescence-based thermostability assay and a fluorescent ATP-competitive inhibitor, we show that the highest-expressing kinases are folded and have well-formed ATP binding sites. We also demonstrate how the resulting expressing constructs can be used for the biophysical and biochemical study of clinical mutations by engineering a panel of 48 Src mutations and 46 Abl mutations via single-primer mutagenesis and screening the resulting library for expression yields. The wild-type kinase construct library is available publicly via Addgene, and should prove to be of high utility for experiments focused on drug discovery and the emergence of drug resistance.","10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01081"

We showed, that the 9aaTAD domains are conserved in the human nuclear hormone receptors including HNF4, RARa, VDR and PPARg.

We assume that fitness measurements come with high uncertainty or are even unavailable, as is the case for many empirical studies, and derive interactions only from comparisons of genotypes with respect to their fitness, i.e. from partial fitness orders. We present a characterization of the class of partial fitness orders that imply interactions, using a graph-theoretic approach.

Given the relevance of the escapees in biology and medicine, we investigated XCI at an unprecedented single-cell resolution. We combined deep single-cell RNA sequencing with whole genome sequencing to examine allelic specific expression (ASE) in 935 primary fibroblast and 48 lymphoblastoid single cells from five female individuals. In this framework we integrated an original method to identify and exclude doublets of cells. We have identified 55 genes as escapees including 5 novel escapee genes. Moreover, we observed that all genes exhibit a variable propensity to escape XCI in each cell and cell type, and that each cell displays a distinct expression profile of the escapee genes. We devised a novel metric, the Inactivation Score (IS), defined as the mean of the allelic expression profiles of the escapees per cell, and discovered a heterogeneous and continuous degree of cellular XCI with extremes represented by \""inactive\"" cells, i.e., exclusively expressing the escaping genes from the active X chromosome, and \""escaping\"" cells, expressing the escapees from both alleles. Intriguingly we found that XIST is the major genetic determinant of IS, and that XIST expression, higher in G0 phase, is negatively correlated with the expression of escapees, inactivated and pseudoautosomal genes. In this study we use single-cell allele specific expression to identify novel escapees in different tissues and provide evidence of an unexpected cellular heterogeneity of XCI driven by a possible regulatory activity of XIST.","10.1073/pnas.1806811115"

The African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, a model system in social neuroscience, is well known for its highly plastic social phenotypes in adulthood. Here, we rear juveniles in either social groups or pairs to investigate the effects of early-life social environments on behavior and neuroendocrine gene expression. We find that both juvenile behavior and neuroendocrine function are sensitive to early-life effects. Behavior robustly co-varies across multiple contexts (open field, social cue investigation, and dominance behavior assays) to form a behavioral syndrome, with pair-reared juveniles towards the end of syndrome that is less active and socially interactive. Pair-reared juveniles also submit more readily as subordinates. In a separate cohort, we measured whole brain expression of stress and sex hormone genes. Expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 1a was elevated in group-reared juveniles, supporting a highly-conserved role for the stress axis mediating early-life effects. The effect of rearing environment on androgen receptor (AR)  and estrogen receptor (ER)  expression was mediated by treatment duration (1 vs. 5 weeks). Finally, expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and GR2 decreased significantly over time. Rearing environment also caused striking differences in gene co-expression, such that expression was tightly integrated in pair-reared juveniles, but not group-reared or isolates. Together, this research demonstrates the important developmental origins of behavioral phenotypes and identifies potential behavioral and neuroendocrine mechanisms.","10.1016/j.yhbeh.2019.06.016"

The continued presence of the bacteria, could be attributed to either a single persistent strain or reinfection with the same or different strain. We examined sequential isolates collected over time from Mav infected individuals and observed that most patients carried the same strain overtime and were not re infected. We observed high rates of mutation within the serial isolates, accompanied with changes in virulence properties. In the light of increase in incidence of MAC related infections, this study highlights the possibility that host adapted Mav undergo genetic modifications to cope with the host environment and thereby persisting longer.","10.1128/iai.00323-18"

After brain injury, the cerebral cortex is especially difficult to repair due to its extremely low rate of adult neurogenesis. Previous studies have converted glial cells into neurons, but the total number of neurons generated is rather limited, casting doubt about its therapeutic potential. Here, we demonstrate that high-efficiency neuroregeneration can be achieved in adult mammalian brains by making use of an engineered AAV Cre-FLEX system to convert a large number of reactive astrocytes into functional neurons. Specifically, using a combination of GFAP::Cre and FLEX-NeuroD1 AAV system, we were able to regenerate enough new neurons from astrocytes to cover about 40% of the neurons lost from an ischemic injury (400 NeuN+ new neurons/mm2), compared to previously reported an average of <1% of cortical neurons (2-8 NeuN+ neurons/mm2) in an ischemic-injured adult mammalian cortex. Importantly, this in situ astrocyte-to-neuron conversion process also improved survival of injured pre-existing neurons, (additional 400 neurons/mm2), leading to a repaired motor cortex with layered cortical structures. Moreover, NeuroD1-converted neurons not only form functional neural circuits but also rescue motor and memory deficits after ischemic injury. Our results establish the proof-of-principle that a highly efficient in situ astrocyte-to-neuron conversion approach provides a novel treatment for neurological disorders that are in need of new neurons.","10.1016/j.ymthe.2019.09.003"

These data are more valuable in aggregate: joint analysis of genomes from many sources increases sample size and statistical power for trait mapping, and will enable studies of genome biology, population genetics and genome function at unprecedented scale. A central challenge for joint analysis is that different WGS data processing and analysis pipelines cause substantial batch effects in combined datasets, necessitating computationally expensive reprocessing and harmonization prior to variant calling. This approach is no longer tenable given the scale of current studies and data volumes. Here, in a collaboration across multiple genome centers and NIH programs, we define WGS data processing standards that allow different groups to produce \""functionally equivalent\"" (FE) results suitable for joint variant calling with minimal batch effects. Our approach promotes broad harmonization of upstream data processing steps, while allowing for diverse variant callers. Importantly, it allows each group to continue innovating on data processing pipelines, as long as results remain compatible. We present initial FE pipelines developed at five genome centers and show that they yield similar variant calling results - including single nucleotide (SNV), insertion/deletion (indel) and structural variation (SV) - and produce significantly less variability than sequencing replicates. Residual inter-pipeline variability is concentrated at low quality sites and repetitive genomic regions prone to stochastic effects.

Phylodynamic inference based on pathogen genetic sequence data has emerged as useful supplement to epidemic surveillance, however commonly-used mechanistic models that are typically fitted to non-genetic surveillance data are rarely fitted to pathogen genetic data due to a dearth of software tools, and the theory required to conduct such inference has been developed only recently.

Mutation load and PD-L1 staining are leading biomarkers associated with response, but each is an imperfect predictor. A key challenge to predicting response is modeling the interaction between the tumor and immune system. We begin to address this challenge with a multifactorial model for response to anti-PD-L1 therapy. We train a model to predict immune response in patients after treatment based on 36 clinical, tumor, and circulating features collected prior to treatment. We analyze data from 21 bladder cancer patients [2] using the elastic net high-dimensional regression procedure [3] and, as training set error is a biased and overly optimistic measure of prediction error, we use leave-one-out cross-validation to obtain unbiased estimates of accuracy on held-out patients. In held-out patients, the model explains 79% of the variance in T cell clonal expansion. This predicted immune response is multifactorial, as the variance explained is at most 23% if clinical, tumor, or circulating features are excluded. Moreover, if patients are triaged according to predicted expansion, only 38% of non-durable clinical benefit (DCB) patients need be treated to ensure that 100% of DCB patients are treated. In contrast, using mutation load or PD-L1 staining alone, one must treat at least 77% of non-DCB patients to ensure that all DCB patients receive treatment. Thus, integrative models of immune response may improve our ability to anticipate clinical benefit of immunotherapy.","10.1371/journal.pone.0208422"

While telephone-based interventions targeting weight loss are used routinely in the general populations, the cost-effectiveness of referring patients with knee osteoarthritis to these is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of referral to a telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service for patients with knee osteoarthritis, who are overweight or obese, compared to usual care.

MethodsWe randomised 120 patients with knee osteoarthritis to an intervention or usual care control group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the intervention group received a referral to an existing non-disease specific 6-month telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle service. The primary outcome of the study was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, disability, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Costs included intervention costs, healthcare utilisation costs (healthcare services and medication use) and absenteeism costs due to knee pain. The primary cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal perspective.

ResultsMean cost differences between groups (intervention minus control) were, $454 (95%CI: -2735 to 4206) for healthcare costs, $-36, (95%CI: -73 to 2) for medication costs, and $-13 (95%CI: -225 to 235) for absenteeism costs. The total mean difference in societal costs was $1022 (95%CI: -2201 to 4771). For all outcomes, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective compared with usual care was less than 0.33 at all willingness-to-pay values.

ConclusionFrom a societal perspective, telephone-based weight loss support, provided using an existing non-disease specific 6-month weight management and healthy lifestyle service was not cost-effective in comparison with usual care for overweight and obese patients with knee osteoarthritis for QALYs, pain intensity, disability, weight, and BMI.","NA"

Here, we show that aversive emotions distort trust decisions and cause significant changes in the associated neural circuitry. They reduce trust and suppress trust-specific activity in left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). In addition, aversive emotions reduce the functional connectivity between TPJ and emotion-related regions such as the amygdala. We also find that the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) plays a key role in mediating the impact of aversive emotions on brain-behavior relationships. Functional connectivity of right pSTS with left TPJ not only predicts mean trust taking in the absence of negative emotions, but aversive emotions also largely remove this association between TPJ-pSTS connectivity and behavioral trust. These findings may be useful for a better understanding of the neural circuitry of affective distortions and may thus help identify the neural bases of psychiatric diseases that are associated with emotion-related psychological and behavioral dysfunctions.","NA"

We developed an original theoretical framework in order to interrogate how this competition constrains the behavior of proteins with respect to their partners or random encounters. Our theoretical framework relies on a two-dimensional (2D) representation of interaction energy landscapes with 2D energy maps that reflect in a synthetic way the propensity of a protein to interact with another protein. We investigated the propensity of protein surfaces to interact with functional and arbitrary partners and asked whether their interaction propensity is conserved during the evolution. Therefore, we performed several thousands of cross-docking simulations to systematically characterize the whole energy landscapes of 74 proteins interacting with different sets of homologs, corresponding to their functional partners family or arbitrary protein families. Then, we systematically compared the energy maps resulting from the docking of a given protein with the different protein families of the dataset. Strikingly, we show that the interaction propensity not only of the binding site but also of the rest of the protein surface is conserved for docking partners belonging to the same protein family. Interestingly, this observation holds for docked proteins corresponding to true but also to arbitrary partners. Our theoretical framework enables the characterization of the energy behavior of a protein in interaction with hundreds of selected partners and opens the way for further developments to study the behavior of proteins in a specific environment.","10.1016/j.jmb.2019.12.047"

Obesity has also been associated with neurobehavioural factors such as brain morphology, cognitive performance, and personality. Here, we tested whether these neurobehavioural factors were associated with the heritable variance in obesity measured by body mass index (BMI) in the Human Connectome Project (N=895 siblings). Phenotypically, cortical thickness findings supported the \""right brain hypothesis\"" for obesity. Namely, increased BMI associated with decreased cortical thickness in right frontal lobe and increased thickness in the left frontal lobe, notably in lateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, lower thickness and volume in entorhinal-parahippocampal structures, and increased thickness in parietal-occipital structures in obese participants supported the role of visuospatial function in obesity. Brain morphometry results were supported by cognitive tests, which outlined obesitys negative association with visuospatial function, verbal episodic memory, impulsivity, and cognitive flexibility. Personality-obesity correlations were inconsistent. We then aggregated the effects for each neurobehavioural factor for a behavioural genetics analysis and demonstrated the factors genetic overlap with obesity. Namely, cognitive test scores and brain morphometry had 0.25 - 0.45 genetic correlations with obesity, and the phenotypic correlations with obesity were 77-89% explained by genetic factors. Neurobehavioural factors also had some genetic overlap with each other. In summary, obesity has considerable genetic overlap with brain and cognitive measures. This supports the theory that obesity is inherited via brain function, and may inform intervention strategies.\n\nSignificance StatementObesity is a widespread heritable health condition. Evidence from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and genetics has proposed links between obesity and the brain. The current study tested whether the heritable variance in obesity is explained by brain and behavioural factors in a large brain imaging cohort that included multiple related individuals. We found that the heritable variance in obesity had genetic correlations 0.25 - 0.45 with cognitive tests, cortical thickness, and regional brain volume. In particular, obesity was associated with frontal lobe asymmetry and differences in temporal-parietal perceptual systems. Further, we found genetic overlap between certain brain and behavioural factors. In summary, the genetic vulnerability to obesity is expressed in the brain. This may inform intervention strategies.","10.1073/pnas.1718206115"

For large scale applications, accurate and inexpensive methane predictors are required. Within a livestock precision farming context, the objective of this work was to integrate real-time data on animal feeding behaviour with an in silico model for predicting the individual dynamic pattern of methane emission in cattle. The integration of real-time data with a mathematical model to predict variables that are not directly measured constitutes a software sensor. We developed a dynamic parsimonious grey-box model that uses as predictor variables either dry matter intake (DMI) or the intake time (IT). The model is described by ordinary differential equations. Model building was supported by experimental data of methane emissions from respiration chambers. The data set comes from a study with finishing beef steers (cross-bred Charolais and purebred Luing finishing). DMI and IT were recorded with load cells. A total of 37 individual dynamic patterns of methane production were analysed. Model performance was assessed by concordance analysis between the predicted methane output and the methane measured in respiration chambers. The model predictors DMI and IT performed similarly with a Lins concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.78 on average. When predicting the daily methane production, the CCC was 0.99 for both DMI and IT predictors. Consequently, on the basis of concordance analysis, our model performs very well compared with reported literature results for methane proxies and predictive models. Since IT measurements are easier to obtain than DMI measurements, this study suggests that a software sensor that integrates our in silico model with a real-time sensor providing accurate IT measurements is a viable solution for predicting methane output in a large scale context.\n\nImplicationsReducing methane emissions from ruminants is a major target for sustainable and efficient livestock farming. For the animal, methane production represents a loss of feed energy. For the environment, methane exerts a potent greenhouse effect. Methane mitigation strategies require accurate, non-invasive and inexpensive techniques for estimating individual methane emissions on farm. In this study, we integrate measurements of feeding behaviour in cattle and a mathematical model to estimate individual methane production. Together, model and measurements form a software sensor that efficiently predicts methane output. Our software sensor is a promising approach for estimating methane emissions at large scale.","10.1017/s1751731118002550"

Here, we demonstrate that interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) enables label-free and dynamic visualization of TFP in intact cells of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As a result, we can directly monitor extension, attachment and retraction events on millisecond timescale and nanometer length scale in three dimensions. These capabilities allow us to observe that P. aeruginosa is able to crawl against the direction of flow using short TFP filaments. Also, careful observation show that TFP retract rapidly after surface attachment, suggesting that P. aeruginosa senses contact of the pilus tip with the solid substrate.

To more systematically ascertain and learn from cellular specializations in the brain, we used Drop-seq to perform single-cell RNA sequencing of 690,000 cells sampled from nine regions of the adult mouse brain: frontal and posterior cortex (156,000 and 99,000 cells, respectively), hippocampus (113,000), thalamus (89,000), cerebellum (26,000), and all of the basal ganglia - the striatum (77,000), globus pallidus externus/nucleus basalis (66,000), entopeduncular/subthalamic nuclei (19,000), and the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (44,000). We developed computational approaches to distinguish biological from technical signals in single-cell data, then identified 565 transcriptionally distinct groups of cells, which we annotate and present through interactive online software we developed for visualizing and re-analyzing these data (DropViz). Comparison of cell classes and types across regions revealed features of brain organization. These included a neuronal gene-expression module for synthesizing axonal and presynaptic components; widely shared patterns in the combinatorial co-deployment of voltage-gated ion channels by diverse neuronal populations; functional distinctions among cells of the brain vasculature; and specialization of glutamatergic neurons across cortical regions to a degree not observed in other neuronal or non-neuronal populations. We describe systematic neuronal classifications for two complex, understudied regions of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus externus and substantia nigra reticulata. In the striatum, where neuron types have been intensely researched, our data reveal a previously undescribed population of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) comprising 4% of SPNs. The adult mouse brain cell atlas can serve as a reference for analyses of development, disease, and evolution.","10.1016/j.cell.2018.07.028"

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the ability of the qSOFA in predicting short- and long-term mortality among patients outside the intensive care unit setting.\n\nMethodStudies reporting on the qSOFA and mortality from MEDLINE (published between 1946 and 15th December 2017) and SCOPUS (published before 15th December 2017). Hand-checking of the references of relevant articles was carried out. Studies were included if they involved inclusion of patients presenting to the ED; usage of Sepsis-3 definition with suspected infection; usage of qSOFA score for mortality prognostication; and written in English. Study details, patient demographics, qSOFA scores, short-term (<30 days) and long-term ([&ge;]30 days) mortality were extracted. Two reviewers conducted all reviews and data extraction independently.\n\nResults and DiscussionA total of 39 studies met the selection criteria for full text review and only 36 studies were included. Data on qSOFA scores and mortality rate were extracted from 36 studies from 15 countries. The pooled odds ratio was 5.5 and 4.7 for short-term and long-term mortality respectively. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity for the qSOFA was 48% and 85% for short-term mortality and 32% and 92% for long-term mortality, respectively. Studies reporting on short-term mortality were heterogeneous (Tau=24%, I2=94%, P<0.001), while long-term mortality studies were homogenous (Tau=0%, I2<0.001, P=0.52). The factors contributing to heterogeneity may be wide age group, various clinical settings, variation in the timing of qSOFA scoring, and broad range of clinical diagnosis and criteria. There was no publication bias for short-term mortality analysis.\n\nConclusionqSOFA score showed a poor sensitivity but moderate specificity for both short and long-term mortality prediction in patients with suspected infection. qSOFA score may be a cost-effective tool for sepsis prognostication outside of the ICU setting.","10.1038/s41598-018-35144-6"

These links between bacteria may break over time. Using analytical and numerical calculations on several models to check the results robustness, we study the rate of increase in the number of free bacteria as a function of the replication rate of bacteria, and the resulting distribution of chain sizes. At higher replication rates, the bacteria replicate before the link between daughter bacteria breaks, leading to growing cluster sizes. However at low growth rates two daughter cells have a high probability to break apart. Thus the gut could produce IgA against all the bacteria it has encountered, but the most affected bacteria would be the fast replicating ones, which could destabilize the microbiota.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006986"

Spatial and temporal factors activate the death of Drosophila neural stem cells (neuroblasts) by controlling the transcription of multiple cell death genes through a shared enhancer, enh1. The activity of enh1 is controlled by abdominalA and Notch, but additional inputs are needed for proper specificity. Here we show that the Cut DNA binding protein is required for neuroblast death, acting downstream of enh1. In the nervous system, Cut promotes an open chromatin conformation in the cell death gene locus, allowing cell death gene expression in response to abdominalA. We demonstrate a temporal increase in global H3K27me3 levels in neuroblasts, which is enhanced by cut knockdown. Furthermore, cut regulates the expression of the cohesin subunit Stromalin in the nervous system. The cohesin components Stromalin and NippedB are required for neuroblast death, and knockdown of Stromalin increases repressive histone modifications in neuroblasts. Thus Cut and cohesin regulate apoptosis in the developing nervous system by altering the chromatin landscape.\n\nSummary statementCut regulates the programmed death of neural stem cells by altering cohesin levels and promoting a more open chromatin conformation to allow cell death gene expression.","10.1242/dev.166603"

We show here that the concept of genetic conflict provides new insight into local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. Local adaptation to heterogeneous habitats sometimes occurs as tightly linked clusters of genes with among-habitat polymorphism, referred to as genomic islands of divergence, and our work sheds light on their evolution. Phenotypic plasticity can also influence the divergence between ecotypes, through developmental responses to habitat-specificcues. We show that clustered genes coding for ecological specialism and unlinked generalist genes coding for phenotypic plasticity differ in their evolutionary interest. This is an ecological genetic conflict, operating between habitat specialism and phenotypically plastic generalism. The phenomenon occurs both for single traits and for syndromes of co-adapted traits. Using individual-based simulations and numerical analysis, we investigate how among-habitat genetic polymorphism and phenotypic plasticity depend on genetic architecture. We show that for plasticity genes that are unlinked to a genomic island of divergence, the slope of a reaction norm will be steeper in comparison with the slope favored by plasticity genes that are tightly linked to genes for local adaptation.","10.1086/700719"

These differ from the nervous systems of invertebrates in several ways, including the evolution of new cell types, and the emergence and elaboration of patterning mechanisms to organise cells in time and space. Vertebrates also generally have many more cells in their central nervous systems than invertebrates, and an increase in neural cell number may have contributed to the sophisticated anatomy of the brain and spinal cord. Here we study how increased cell number evolved in the vertebrate central nervous system, investigating the regulation of cell proliferation in lampreys as basally-diverging vertebrate, and focusing on the spinal cord because of its relatively simple anatomy. Markers of proliferating cells show that a medial proliferative progenitor zone is found throughout the lamprey spinal cord. We show that inhibition of Notch signalling disrupts the maintenance of this proliferative zone. When Notch signalling is blocked progenitor cells differentiate precociously, the proliferative medial zone is lost, and differentiation markers activate throughout the medial-lateral axis of the spinal cord. Comparison to other chordates suggests that the emergence of a persistent Notch-regulated proliferative progenitor zone in the medial spinal cord of vertebrate ancestors was a critical step for the evolution of the vertebrate spinal cord and its complexity.\n\nSummary statementVertebrates develop nervous systems with numerous cells.

These include loss-of-function mutations that result in reduced virulence, altered metabolism and other phenotypes that are thought to confer a selective advantage for long-term persistence. Recently, clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa that hyperproduce agmatine (decarboxylated arginine) were cultured from individuals with CF. Sputum concentrations of this metabolite were also shown to correlate with disease severity. This raised the question of whether agmatine accumulation might also confer a selective advantage for P. aeruginosa in vivo during chronic colonization of the lung. Here, we screened a library of P. aeruginosa CF clinical isolates and found that ~5% of subjects harbored isolates with an agmatine hyperproducing phenotype. Agmatine accumulation was a direct result of mutations in aguA, encoding the arginine deiminase that catalyzes the conversion of agmatine into various polyamines. We also found that agmatine hyperproducing isolates (aguA-) had increased tolerance to the cationic antibiotics gentamicin, tobramycin and colistin relative to their chromosomally complemented strains (aguA+). Finally, we revealed that agmatine diminishes IL-8 production by airway epithelial cells in response to bacterial infection, with a consequent decrease in neutrophil recruitment to the murine airways in an acute pneumonia model. These data highlight a potential new role for bacterial-derived agmatine that may have important consequences for the long-term persistence of P. aeruginosa in the CF airways.","10.1099/jmm.0.000928"

First, we defined the VWFA using a words > objects contrast and found that only skilled readers had a region that responded more to words than objects. Second, we defined the VWFA using a words > faces contrast and examined selectivity for words over objects in this region. We found that word selectivity strongly correlated with reading skill, suggesting reading skill-dependent tuning for words. Furthermore, we found that low word selectivity in struggling readers was not due to a lack of response to words, but to a high response to objects.

While this is  the least worst scenario for those with a lack of appropriate biological care, it is recognised that these children are exposed to major stressors correlated with behavioural changes, particularly in the realm of social cognition into adulthood. Here we model foster care in rodents: rat pups are removed from their biological mother and placed with a non-genetically related dam. This prevented the entorhinal cortex from generating patterns of gamma rhythms required for normal parahippocampal function relevant to social interaction. These changes correlated with a reduction in NMDA receptor-mediated excitation, and changes in parvalbumin expression in interneurons. These data suggest that early life care delivered by a non-biological parent may disrupt social behaviour but, in contrast, generate neurobiological changes antagonistic to those currently associated with psychosis.\n\nSignificance StatementCross fostering is an effective approach for delineating the effect of environment from genetic influences upon behavior. This involves removal of pups from one mother and transfer to another lactating dam. This manipulation is considered as a mild form of early life stress, producing neurobehavioral changes such as alterations in social interaction. We demonstrate that cross fostering produces changes in the ability of cortical microcircuits to generate oscillatory rhythms, in particular the gamma rhythm, in brain regions important for social cognition. This reduction in gamma rhythmogenesis is related to a reduction in synaptic drive provided by the NMDA receptor. One implication of this work is that the modulation of NMDA receptors offers a potential therapeutic strategy for disorders involving impaired sociability.","NA"

In light of some recent controversies about statistical methods and the resulting biological conclusions, I here discuss the interpretation of regression lines and show how to avoid spurious effects. General linear models based on ordinary least square (OLS) regression are often used to quantify sexual dimorphism in a trait of interest that is modelled as a function of sex while controlling for size as a covariate. However, an analysis of artificially generated data where males and females differ in size only, but are otherwise built according to the same principles, shows that the OLS method induces a spurious dimorphism where there is none. Hence, OLS-based general linear models should not be regarded as a fail-proof tool that automatically provides the correct answer to whatever question one has in mind. Here I show how to avoid misinterpretation and how to best proceed with answering the recent debate about sexual dimorphism in digit ratio, a trait that is thought to reflect sex-hormone levels during development. The limited data, currently available to me, suggests that the widely accepted sexual dimorphism in digit ratio might well be only a by-product of an allometric shift in shape, urgently calling for a re-examination in larger data sets on humans and other vertebrates.","NA"

Here, we use a case-control gene approach to show that balancing selection is an important force shaping AMP diversity in two species of Drosophila. In D. melanogaster, this is most clearly observed in ancestral African populations. Furthermore, the signature of balancing selection is even clearer once background selection has been accounted for. Balancing selection also acts on AMPs in D. mauritiana, an isolated island endemic separated from D. melanogaster by about 4 million years of evolution.

We have developed an analytical framework that integrates tissue-specific gene expression, Mendelian randomization and multiple-trait colocalization to develop functional mechanistic insight into the causal pathway from genetic variant to complex trait.\n\nMethodsWe undertook a transcriptome-wide association study in a population of young individuals to uncover genetic variants associated with both nearby gene expression and cardiovascular traits. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was then applied using large-scale datasets to investigate whether changes in gene expression within certain tissue types may influence cardiovascular trait variation. We subsequently performed Bayesian multiple-trait colocalization to further interrogate findings and also gain insight into whether DNA methylation, as well as gene expression, may play a role in disease susceptibility.\n\nResultsEight genetic loci were associated with changes in gene expression and early life measures of cardiovascular function. Our Mendelian randomization analysis provided evidence of tissue-specific effects at multiple loci, of which the effects at the ADCY3 and FADS1 loci for body mass index and cholesterol respectively were particularly insightful. Multiple trait colocalization uncovered evidence which suggested that changes in DNA methylation at the promoter region upstream of FADS1/TMEM258 may also play a role in cardiovascular trait variation along with gene expression. Furthermore, colocalization analyses were able to uncover evidence of tissue-specificity, most prominantly between SORT1 expression in liver tissue and cholesterol levels.\n\nConclusionsDisease susceptibility can be influenced by differential changes in tissue-specific gene expression and DNA methylation. Our analytical framework should prove valuable in elucidating mechanisms in disease, as well as helping prioritize putative causal genes at associated loci where multiple nearby genes may be co-regulated. Future studies which continue to uncover quantitative trait loci for molecular traits across various tissue and cell typse will further improve our capability to understand and prevent disease.","10.1186/s13073-019-0613-2"

Transcription factors and chromatin regulate gene expression transcriptionally, while microRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that function post-transcriptionally. Systematically identifying the post-transcriptional targets of miRNAs and the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the same targets can shed light on regulatory networks connecting transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. We used iCLIP (individual crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) for the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) component AGO2 and global miRNA depletion to identify genes directly targeted by miRNAs. We found that PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2) and its associated histone mark, H3K27me3, is enriched at hundreds of miRNA-repressed genes. We show that these genes are directly repressed by PRC2 and constitute a significant proportion of direct PRC2 targets. For just over half of the genes co-repressed by PRC2 and miRNAs, PRC2 promotes their miRNA-mediated repression by increasing expression of the miRNAs that are likely to target them. miRNAs also repress the remainder of the PRC2 target genes, but independently of PRC2. Thus, miRNAs post-transcriptionally reinforce silencing of PRC2-repressed genes that are inefficiently repressed at the level of chromatin, by either forming a feed-forward regulatory network with PRC2 or repressing them independently of PRC2.","10.1101/gr.238311.118"

To control attention, we made use of a design in which offers occurred in sequence. By looking at pupil responses after choice but before reward, we confirmed the previously observed positive association between pupil size and anticipated reward values. Surprisingly, however, we find that pupil size is negatively correlated with the value of offered gambles before choice, during both evaluation and comparison stages of the task. These results demonstrate a functional distinction between offered and anticipated rewards, and present evidence against a narrow version of the simulation hypothesis, the idea that we represent offers by reactivating states associated with anticipating them. They also suggest that pupil size is correlated with relative, not absolute, values of offers, suggestive of an accept-reject model of comparison.","10.1007/s10071-018-1202-2"

Fundamental to this functional connectivity gradient analysis is the assumption that the functional organization is stable and uniform across the region of interest. To evaluate this assumption, we developed a model testing procedure to arbitrate between overlapping, shifted, or different topographic connectivity gradients across subdivisions of a structure. We tested the procedure using the striatum, a subcortical structure consisting of the caudate nucleus and putamen, in which an extensive literature, primarily from rodents and non-human primates, suggest to have a shared topographic organization of a single diagonal gradient. We found, across multiple resting state fMRI data samples of different spatial resolutions in humans, and one macaque resting state fMRI data sample, that the models with different functional connectivity gradients across the caudate and putamen was the preferred model. The model selection procedure was validated in control conditions of checkerboard subdivisions, demonstrating the expected overlapping gradient. More specifically, while we replicated the diagonal organization of the functional connectivity gradients in both the caudate and putamen, our analysis also revealed a medial-lateral organization within the caudate. Not surprisingly, performing the same analysis assuming a unitary gradient obfuscates the medial-lateral organization of the caudate, producing only a diagonal gradient. These findings demonstrate the importance of testing basic assumptions and evaluating interpretations across species. The significance of differential topographic gradients across the putamen and caudate and the medial-lateral gradient of the caudate in humans should be tested in future studies.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.022"

Here we describe the first human evaluation of these novel radiotracers.\n\nMethodsAmyloid PET positive Alzheimers disease (AD) patients and young healthy subjects (YC) each received two different tau tracers. Dynamic 90 min scans were obtained after bolus injection of [11C]RO-963, [11C]RO-643 or [18F]RO-948. Arterial blood sampling was performed in 11 healthy controls (HC) and 11 AD. Regions were defined on MRI, and PET data were quantified by plasma reference graphical analysis (for VT) and target cerebellum ratio (SUVR60-90). SUVR images were also analyzed voxelwise. Five older healthy subjects (OC) each received two scans with [18F]RO-948 for evaluation of test-retest variability. Four AD subjects received a repeat [18F]RO-948 scan over about 1 year. Six additional HC (3M: 3F; 41-67y) each received one whole body dosimetry scan with [18F]RO-948.\n\nResultsIn YC, peak SUV values were observed in the temporal lobe with values of approximately 3.0 for [11C]RO-963, 1.5 for [11C]RO-643 and 3.5 for [18F]RO-948. Over all brain regions and subjects, the trend was that [18F]RO-948 had the highest peak SUV value, followed by [11C]RO-963, and then [11C]RO-643. Regional analysis of SUVR and VT for [11C]RO-643 and [18F]RO-948 clearly discriminated AD and HC groups. Compartmental modeling confirmed that [11C]RO-643 had lower brain entry than both [18F]RO-963 and [18F]RO-948, and [18F]RO-948 showed a better contrast between (predicted) areas of high vs low tau accumulation. Thus, our subsequent analysis focused on [18F]RO-948. Both voxelwise and region-based analysis of [18F]RO-948 binding in HC vs AD revealed multiple areas where AD and HC significantly differed. Of 22 high-binding regions, 13 showed significant group difference (following ANOVA, F=45, p<10-5). Voxelwise analysis also revealed a set of symmetrical clusters where AD>HC (threshold of p<0.001, cluster size k>50).\n\nConclusions[18F]RO-948 demonstrates superior characteristics to [11C]RO-643 and [18F]RO-963 for characterization of tau pathology in AD. Regional binding data and kinetic properties of RO-948 compare favorably with existing other tau PET tracers.","10.2967/jnumed.118.209916"

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has proven indispensable in this endeavour. Recently, there has been growing interest in tackling this problem by mapping semantic concepts onto brain regions using repositories of images and text from the neuroimaging literature. However, no study has thus far approached this problem using (dense) vector representations of words. Using data from the Neurosynth database, we sought to develop a model that could (A) capture local correlations between words in text, as well as topics, (B) capture representation of distributed brain networks in relation to word embeddings, and (C) generate synthetic images given word inputs. We show that jointly embedding words and brain imaging data on a vector space can yield semantic representations that sensibly relate concepts across biological, psychological, and observational levels of analysis. Moreover, our proposed model makes no assumption about spatial orientation of fMRI voxels, which allows for embedding of distributed brain networks onto the semantic space. We demonstrate this capability by generating synthetic brain activation vectors from word inputs. Our model has the potential to advance neuroimaging meta-analysis as well as contextual word-embedding methods more broadly.","NA"

SWRs and their concomitant neural activity are thought to be important for memory consolidation, recall, and memory-guided decision making. Temporally-selective manipulations of hippocampal neural activity upon online hippocampal SWR detection have been used as causal evidence of the importance of SWR for mnemonic process as evinced by behavioral and/or physiological changes. However, though this approach is becoming more wide spread, the performance trade-offs involved in building a SWR detection and disruption system have not been explored, limiting the design and interpretation of SWR detection experiments. We present an open source, plug-and-play, online ripple detection system with a detailed performance characterization. Our system has been constructed to interface with an open source software platform, Trodes, and two hardware acquisition platforms, Open Ephys and SpikeGadgets. We show that our in vivo results -- approximately 80% detection latencies falling in between {approx}20-66 ms with {approx}2 ms closed-loop latencies while maintaining <10 false detections per minute -- are dependent upon both algorithmic trade-offs and acquisition hardware.

Indeed, this is essential for controlled comparison between different observations or for the wider dissemination of workflows. Providing this type of reproducibility, however, is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which generally come in various versions. Moreover, in many fields (bioinformatics being a prime example), these versions are subject to continual change due to rapidly evolving technologies, further complicating problems related to reproducibility. Here, we propose a principled approach for building analysis pipelines and managing their dependencies. As a case study to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present a set of highly reproducible pipelines for the analysis of RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Bisulfite-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq. All pipelines process raw experimental data, and generate reports containing publication-ready plots and figures, with interactive report elements and standard observables. Users may install these highly reproducible packages and apply them to their own datasets without any special computational expertise beyond the use of the command line. We hope such a toolkit will provide immediate benefit to laboratory workers wishing to process their own data sets or bioinformaticians seeking to automate all, or parts of, their analyses.

One small subset of  apochloritic diatoms in the genus Nitzschia have lost their ability to photosynthesize and require extracellular carbon for growth. Similar to other secondarily nonphotosynthetic taxa, apochloritic diatoms maintain colorless plastids with highly reduced plastid genomes. Although the narrow taxonomic breadth of apochloritic diatoms suggests a single loss of photosynthesis in the common ancestor of these species, previous phylogenetic analyses suggested that photosynthesis was lost multiple times. We sequenced additional phylogenetic markers from the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes for a larger set of taxa and found that the best trees for datasets representing all three genetic compartments provided low to moderate support for monophyly of apochloritic Nitzschia, consistent with a single loss of photosynthesis in diatoms. We sequenced the plastid genome of one apochloritic species and found that it was highly similar in all respects to the plastid genome of another apochloritic Nitzschia species, indicating that streamlining of the plastid genome had completed prior to the split of these two species. Finally, it is increasingly clear that some locales host relatively large numbers apochloritic Nitzschia species that span the phylogenetic diversity of the group, indicating that these species co-exist because of resource abundance or resource partitioning in ecologically favorable habitats. A better understanding of the phylogeny and ecology of this group, together with emerging genomic resources, will help identify the factors that have driven and maintained the loss of photosynthesis in this group, a rare event in diatoms.","NA"

This paper explores the limits of biochemically plausible controller design for the problem of robust perfect adaptation (RPA), biologists term for robust steady state tracking. It is well-known that for a large class of nonlinear systems, a system has RPA iff it has integral feedback control (IFC), which has been used extensively in real control systems to achieve RPA. However, we show that due to intrinsic physical limitations on the dynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs), cells cannot implement IFC directly in the concentration of a chemical species. This contrasts with electronic implementations, particularly digital, where it is trivial to implement IFC directly in a single state. Therefore, biomolecular systems have to achieve RPA by encoding the integral control variable into the network architecture of a CRN. We describe a general framework to implement RPA in CRNs and show that well-known network motifs that achieve RPA, such as (negative) integral feedback (IFB) and incoherent feedforward (IFF), are examples of such implementations. We also develop methods to solve the problem of designing integral feedback variables for unknown plants. This standard control notion is surprisingly nontrivial and relatively unstudied in biomolecular control. The methods developed here connect different existing fields and approaches on the problem of biomolecular control, and hold promise for systematic chemical reaction controller synthesis as well as analysis.","NA"

Simulation models suggest that integrity of white matter (WM) microstructure should be positively related to the complexity of BOLD signal--a measure of network interactions. Using 121 young adults from the Human Connectome Project, we empirically tested whether greater WM integrity would be associated with greater complexity of the BOLD signal during rest via multiscale entropy. Multiscale entropy measures the lack of predictability within a given time series across varying time scales, thus being able to estimate fluctuating signal dynamics within brain networks. Using multivariate analysis techniques (Partial Least Squares), we found that greater WM integrity was associated with greater network complexity at fast time scales, but less network complexity at slower time scales. These findings implicate two separate pathways through which WM integrity affects brain function in the prefrontal cortex--an executive-prefrontal pathway and a perceptuo-occipital pathway. In two additional samples, the main patterns of WM and network complexity were replicated. These findings support simulation models of WM integrity and network complexity and provide new insights into brain structure-function relationships.","10.3389/fnint.2018.00043"

The model suggests that young blood treatments can induce a substantial delay of organ failure with only minor increase in cancer risk. The benefit of rejuvenation therapy as well as the impact on cancer risk depend on the biological age at the time of treatment and on the overall cell turnover rate of the organs. Different organs have to be considered separately in the planning of the systemic treatment. In particular, the model predicts that the treatment schedules successfully applied in mice are not directly transferable to humans and guidelines for successful protocols are proposed.

Intuitively, the functional constraint would also be expected to prevent such a codon from being deleted. Oddly, to the best of our knowledge, the correlation between the rates of deletion and substitution has never actually been estimated. Here, we use 8,595 protein coding-region sequences from 9 mammalian species to examine the relationship between deletion rate and dN/dS. We found significant positive correlations at both the level of sites and genes. We compared our data against controls consisting of simulated coding sequences evolving along identical phylogenetic trees, where the correlation is not included in the model a priori. A much weaker correlation was found in the corresponding simulated sequences, which is probably caused by alignment errors. In the real data, the correlations cannot be explained by alignment errors. Separate investigations on nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitution rates indicate that the correlation is most likely due to a similarity in patterns of selection rather than mutation rates.","10.1007/s00239-018-9853-9"

Initial fate specification toward enteroendocrine, goblet, and Paneth cell lineages is dependent on Atoh1, a master regulator of secretory differentiation. However, the origin of tuft cells, which participate in Type II immune responses to parasitic infection, is less clear and appears to occur in an Atoh1-independent manner. Here we examine the role of Sox4 in ISC proliferation and differentiation.\n\nMethodsWe used mice with intestinal epithelial-specific conditional knockout of Sox4 (Sox4fl/fl:vilCre; Sox4cKO) to study the role of Sox4 in the small intestine. Crypt- and single cell-derived organoids were used to assay proliferation and ISC potency between control and Sox4cKO mice. Lineage allocation and genetic consequences of Sox4 ablation were studied by immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, and RNA-seq. In vivo infection with helminths and in vitro cytokine treatment in primary intestinal organoids were used to assess tuft cell hyperplasia in control and Sox4cKO samples. Atoh1GFP reporter mice and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) were used to determine co-localization of SOX4 and Atoh1. Wild-type and inducible Atoh1 knockout (Atoh1fl/fl:vilCreER; Atoh1iKO) organoids carrying an inducible Sox4 overexpression vector (Sox4OE) were used to determine the role of Atoh1 in Sox4 driven secretory differentiation.\n\nResultsLoss of Sox4 impairs ISC function and secretory differentiation, resulting in decreased numbers of enteroendocrine and tuft cells. In wild-type mice, SOX4+ cells are significantly upregulated following helminth infection coincident with tuft cell hyperplasia. Sox4 is activated by IL13 in vitro and Sox4cKO knockout mice demonstrate impaired tuft cell hyperplasia and parasite clearance following infection with helminths. A subset of Sox4-expressing cells colocalize with Atoh1 and enteroendocrine markers by scRNA-seq, while Sox4+/Atoh1-cells correlate strongly with tuft cell populations. Gain-of-function studies in primary organoids demonstrate that Sox4 is sufficient to drive both enteroendocrine and tuft cell differentiation, and can do so in the absence of Atoh1.\n\nConclusionOur data demonstrate that Sox4 promotes enteroendocrine and tuft cell lineage allocation independently of Atoh1. These results challenge long-standing views of Atoh1 as the sole regulator of secretory differentiation in the intestine and are relevant for understanding host epithelial responses to parasitic infection.","10.1053/j.gastro.2018.07.023"

L.","Philip Erm","The University of Melbourne","2018-04-11",3,"4","new results","ecology","Understanding the dynamics of biological invasions is crucial for managing numerous phenomena, from invasive species to tumours. Despite the breadth of application, and substantial theoretical development, invasions have proven difficult to predict. This may partly be due to an underappreciation of the interaction between the Allee effect (where individuals in low-density populations suffer lowered fitness) and evolution during invasions. Since invasion fronts are regions of perpetually low population density, selection should favour vanguard invaders that are resistant to Allee effects. Evolution in response to this pressure could cause invasions to transition from pushed waves, propelled by dispersal from behind the invasion front, to pulled waves, driven by the invasion vanguard. To examine this possibility, we construct an individual-based model in which a trait that governs resistance to the Allee effect evolves during an invasion. We find that vanguard invaders rapidly evolve resistance to the Allee effect, causing invasions to accelerate. This also results in invasions transforming from pushed waves into pulled waves; an outcome with important consequences for the predictability of invasion speed. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for evolution in invasion forecasts, and suggest that it has the capacity to fundamentally alter broader invasion dynamics.","10.1086/707324"

During its inchworm motion driven by ATP consumption, the remodeler overwrites the original nucleosome energy landscape via steric and electrostatic interactions to induce sliding of nucleosomal DNA. Repositioning is initiated at the remodeler binding location via the generation of twist defects, which then spontaneously propagate to complete sliding throughout the entire nucleosome.

The diauxic shift of Escherichia coli, growing first on glucose and, after it is exhausted, on acetate, is still today actively studied. As a fundamental example of metabolic adaptation, we are interested in understanding if diauxie in monocultures of E. coli is a coordinated and uniform metabolic shift, or rather the observable emergent result of individual sub-populations behavior. To do so we first develop a modeling framework that integrates dynamic models (ordinary differential equation systems) with structural models (metabolic networks), providing an open source modeling framework that is suitable to investigate the dynamics of microbial communities. We apply our methods to model E. coli either as having an average, unique metabolic state or as being the combination of two E. coli populations adapted to one of the two carbon sources. Our results are in strong agreement with previously published data and suggest that rather than a coordinated metabolic shift, diauxie could be the emergent pattern resulting from a survival strategy where individual cells differentiate for optimal growth on different substrates in view of environmental fluctuations. This work offers a new perspective on how to use dynamic metabolic modeling to investigate population dynamics, as the proposed approach can be easily transfered to studies on other multi-species communities as well as single cells.\n\nImportanceEscherichia coli diauxie is a fundamental example of metabolic adaptation that has not yet been completely understood, and to this aim approaches integrating experimental and theoretical biology are needed. We present a novel dynamic metabolic modeling approach that captures diauxie as an emergent property of sub-population dynamics rather than a homogeneous metabolic shift in E. coli monocultures. Without fine tuning of the parameters of E. coli core genome-scale model we obtain good agreement with published data. Our results suggest a change of paradigm in using single organism metabolic models, which can only to a certain approximation represent the average population metabolic state. We finally provide an open source modeling framework that can be applied to model multi-organism dynamics in variable environments.","NA"

Transcription factors and chromatin regulate gene expression transcriptionally, while microRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that function post-transcriptionally. Systematically identifying the post-transcriptional targets of miRNAs and the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the same targets can shed light on regulatory networks connecting transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. We used iCLIP (individual crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) for the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) component AGO2 and global miRNA depletion to identify genes directly targeted by miRNAs. We found that PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2) and its associated histone mark, H3K27me3, is enriched at hundreds of miRNA-repressed genes. We show that these genes are directly repressed by PRC2 and constitute a significant proportion of direct PRC2 targets. For just over half of the genes co-repressed by PRC2 and miRNAs, PRC2 promotes their miRNA-mediated repression by increasing expression of the miRNAs that are likely to target them. miRNAs also repress the remainder of the PRC2 target genes, but independently of PRC2. Thus, miRNAs post-transcriptionally reinforce silencing of PRC2-repressed genes that are inefficiently repressed at the level of chromatin, by either forming a feed-forward regulatory network with PRC2 or repressing them independently of PRC2.","10.1101/gr.238311.118"

In this study, we assessed robustness of bristle number to incoming genetic and environmental variation for eight bristle types in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, allowing for a straightforward comparison of the robustness observed between bristle types. We measured the response of bristle number mean and variance to changes in temperature and in the number of copies of two genes (scute and miR-9a) known to be involved in bristle development. Many combinations between the three factors were tested, thus allowing to test for the effect of each factor in different contexts for the two other factors - to which we refer herein as different backgrounds. We have found different responses between bristle types, suggesting that they present different levels of robustness to the factors tested.

Much of this progress depends on collaborations and access to genomes, thus, a number of initiatives have been introduced to support seamless data sharing. Among these, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health runs a popular platform, called Matchmaker Exchange, that allows researchers to perform queries for rare genetic disease discovery over multiple federated databases. Queries include gene variations which are linked to rare diseases, and the ability to find other researchers that have seen or have interest in those variations is extremely valuable.

However, its exact role in neurodevelopment and brain function is mostly unknown.

Here we show that Mbd2-deficiency in mice (Mbd2-/-) results in deficits in cognitive, social and emotional functions. Mbd2 binds regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in the hippocampus and loss of Mbd2 alters the expression of hundreds of genes with a robust down-regulation of neuronal gene pathways. Further, a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis found an altered DNA methylation pattern in regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in Mbd2-/- mice. Differentially expressed genes significantly overlap with gene-expression changes observed in brain of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) individuals. Notably, down-regulated genes are significantly enriched for human ortholog ASD risk-genes. Observed hippocampal morphological abnormalities were similar to those found in individuals with ASD and ASD rodent models. Mbd2 knockdown partially recapitulates the behavioral phenotypes observed in Mbd2-/- mice.

Early studies of humans with amnesia led to the hippocampus being viewed as the critical structure for episodic memory, but human lesions are imprecise, making it difficult to identify the anatomical structures underlying memory impairments. Rodent studies enable great temporal and anatomical precision in hippocampal manipulations, but not investigation of the rich assortment of interleaved memories that occurs in humans. Thus it is not known how lesions restricted to the hippocampus affect the retrieval of multiple sequentially encoded memories. Furthermore, disagreement exists as to whether hippocampal inactivations lead to a temporally graded, or ungraded amnesia, which could be a consequence of different types hippocampal disruption observed in rodent and human studies. In the current study, four rhesus monkeys received bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and were compared to thirteen unoperated controls on recognition and new learning of visual object-in-place scenes. Monkeys with hippocampal lesions were significantly impaired compared to controls at remembering scenes that were encoded before the lesion. We did not observe any temporal gradient effect of the lesion on memory recognition, with recent and remote memories being equally affected by the lesion. Monkeys with hippocampal lesions showed no deficits in learning and later recognising new scenes. Thus, the hippocampus, like other cortical regions, may be engaged in the acquisition and storage of new memories, but its role can be taken over by spared regions following a lesion. These findings illustrate the utility of experimental paradigms for studying retrograde and anterograde amnesia that make use of the capacity of nonhuman primates to rapidly acquire many distinct visual memories.","10.1523/jneurosci.0832-18.2018"

In this work, we explore the answers to these two questions by performing an exhaustive assessment of the STAR aligner. We assess STARs performance across a range of alignment parameters using common metrics, and then on biologically focused tasks. We find technical metrics such as fraction mapping or expression profile correlation to be uninformative, capturing properties unlikely to have any role in biological discovery. Surprisingly, we find that changes in alignment parameters within a wide range have little impact on both technical and biological performance. Yet, when performance finally does break, it happens in difficult regions, such as X-Y paralogs and MHC genes. We believe improved reporting by developers will help establish where results are likely to be robust or fragile, providing a better baseline to establish where methodological progress can still occur.","10.1093/nar/gky325"

These genes were enriched in RNA processing pathways and encoded ~100 SFs, e.g. hnRNPA1. hnRNPA1 3UTR was pervasively misspliced, yielding the transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Thus, we knocked it down in B-lymphoblastoid cells, identified 213 hnRNPA1-dependent splicing events, and defined the hnRNPA1 splicing signature in pediatric leukemias. One of its elements was DICER1, a known tumor suppressor gene; its LSVs were consistent with reduced translation of DICER1 mRNA. Additionally, we searched for LSVs in other leukemia and lymphoma drivers and discovered 81 LSVs in 41 genes. 77 LSVs were confirmed using two large independent B-ALL RNA-seq datasets. In fact, the twenty most common B-ALL drivers showed higher prevalence of aberrant splicing than of somatic mutations.

Toward this goal, we demonstrate that we can classify multiple levels of reward from M1 on a movement-by-movement basis under BMI control and use this to gate multiple linear BMI decoders toward improved offline performance. These findings demonstrate that it is possible and meaningful to design a more accurate BMI decoder that takes reward and context into consideration. Our next step in this development will be to incorporate this gating system, or a continuous variant of it, into online BMI performance","10.3389/fnins.2018.00579"

Codon-optimization of proviral DNA rescues viral translation, implying that IFITM-mediated restriction requires recognition of viral RNA elements. In addition, we find that expression of the viral accessory protein Nef can help overcome the IFITM-mediated inhibition of virus production.

Fifty-five patients were scanned using a multi post-labelling delay pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) sequence, first with both arms along the body and then with the affected arm raised into a painful position. Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned as a control group. Arm repositioning resulted in increased perfusion in brain regions involved in sensory processing and movement integration, such as the contralateral primary motor and primary somatosensory cortex, mid- and posterior cingulate cortex, and, bilaterally, in the insular cortex/operculum, putamen, thalamus, midbrain and cerebellum. Perfusion in the thalamus, midbrain and cerebellum was larger in the patient group. Results of a post hoc analysis suggested that the observed perfusion changes were related to pain rather than arm repositioning. This study showed that ASL can be useful in research on clinical ongoing musculoskeletal pain but the technique is not sensitive enough to detect small differences in perfusion.","NA"

A major question is whether individual-specific network topography (i.e., location and spatial arrangement) is behaviorally relevant. Here, we propose a multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) for estimating individual-specific cortical networks and investigate whether individual-specific network topography can predict human behavior. The multiple layers of the MS-HBM explicitly differentiate intra-subject (within-subject) from inter-subject (between-subject) network variability. By ignoring intra-subject variability, previous network mappings might confuse intra-subject variability for inter-subject differences. Compared with other approaches, MS-HBM parcellations generalized better to new rs-fMRI and task-fMRI data from the same subjects. More specifically, MS-HBM parcellations estimated from a single rs-fMRI session (10 minutes) showed comparable generalizability as parcellations estimated by two state-of-the-art methods using five sessions (50 minutes). We also showed that behavioral phenotypes across cognition, personality and emotion could be predicted by individual-specific network topography with modest accuracy, comparable to previous reports predicting phenotypes based on connectivity strength. Network topography estimated by MS-HBM was more effective for behavioral prediction than network size, as well as network topography estimated by other parcellation approaches. Thus, similar to connectivity strength, individual-specific network topography might also serve as a fingerprint of human behavior.","10.1093/cercor/bhy123"

The problem is that local demographic stochasticity generates eco-evolutionary dynamics that are too complicated to make tractable analytical investigations. Here, we circumvent this problem by approximating the selection gradient on a quantitative trait that influences local community dynamics, assuming that such dynamics are deterministic with a stable fixed point, but incorporating the kin selection effects arising from demographic stochasticity. Our approximation reveals that selection depends on how an individual expressing a trait-change influences: (1) its own fitness and the fitness of its current relatives; and (2) the fitness of its downstream relatives through modifications of local ecological conditions (i.e., through ecological inheritance). Mathematically, the effects of ecological inheritance on selection are captured by dispersal-limited versions of press-perturbations of community ecology. We use our approximation to investigate the evolution of helping within- and harming between-species when these behaviours influence demography. We find helping evolves more readily when competition is for material resources rather than space because then, the costs of kin competition are paid by downstream relatives. Similarly, harming between species evolves when it alleviates downstream relatives from inter-specific competition. Beyond these examples, our approximation can help better understand the influence of ecological inheritance on a variety of eco-evolutionary dynamics, from plant-pollinator to predator-prey coevolution.","10.1086/700094"

However, some genes on the inactive X chromosome and outside the pseudoautosomal regions escape from XCI and are expressed from both alleles (escapees). Given the relevance of the escapees in biology and medicine, we investigated XCI at an unprecedented single-cell resolution. We combined deep single-cell RNA sequencing with whole genome sequencing to examine allelic specific expression (ASE) in 935 primary fibroblast and 48 lymphoblastoid single cells from five female individuals. In this framework we integrated an original method to identify and exclude doublets of cells. We have identified 55 genes as escapees including 5 novel escapee genes. Moreover, we observed that all genes exhibit a variable propensity to escape XCI in each cell and cell type, and that each cell displays a distinct expression profile of the escapee genes. We devised a novel metric, the Inactivation Score (IS), defined as the mean of the allelic expression profiles of the escapees per cell, and discovered a heterogeneous and continuous degree of cellular XCI with extremes represented by \""inactive\"" cells, i.e., exclusively expressing the escaping genes from the active X chromosome, and \""escaping\"" cells, expressing the escapees from both alleles. Intriguingly we found that XIST is the major genetic determinant of IS, and that XIST expression, higher in G0 phase, is negatively correlated with the expression of escapees, inactivated and pseudoautosomal genes. In this study we use single-cell allele specific expression to identify novel escapees in different tissues and provide evidence of an unexpected cellular heterogeneity of XCI driven by a possible regulatory activity of XIST.","10.1073/pnas.1806811115"

What are the acute effects of drug treatment and how does an animal respond to these? We developed a simple assay to measure the acute effects of drugs on C.elegans movement and examined the effects of a range of compounds including neuroactive drugs, toxins, environmental stresses and novel compounds on worm movement over a time period of 3 hours. We find that many treatments show complex acute responses -- a phase of rapid paralysis is followed by one or more recovery phases. The recoveries are not the result of some generic stress response but are specific to the drug e.g. recovery from paralysis due to a neuroactive drug requires neurotransmitter pathways whereas recovery from a metabolic inhibitor requires metabolic changes. Finally, we also find that acute responses can vary greatly across development and that there is extensive and complex natural variation in acute responses. In summary, acute responses are sensitive probes of the ability of biological networks to respond to drug treatment and these responses can reveal the action of unexplored pathways.\n\nAuthor SummaryDrugs are powerful tools that let us switch on or off key pathways in whole animals and watch the effects. Here we set up a simple assay to measure how drugs affect the movement of the simple nematode C.elegans -- crucially, we look how those responses change over time. We find that worms have complex responses to many different drugs -- they go through clear phases of paralysis and recovery. The recovery from the initial effect of any drug is not due to a generic stress response but is specific to the way each drug acts. We find for example that worms can recover from paralysis driven by one neurotransmitter pathway by activating a different neurotransmitter pathway or from paralysis caused by loss of one metabolic pathway by turning on a second one. These complex responses show how the basic genetic networks that are needed for normal behaviour and function can rewire and respond to the effect of many drugs.\n\nImportantly, the responses can vary in many ways -- different aged worms or different individuals can have different responses and capturing how drug responses change over time is critical to dissect this complexity.","10.1534/g3.118.200374"

Bacterial and micro-eukaryotic founder species were identified from primary succession and tracked through a defined maturation period using 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in combination with high resolution imaging that utilized stable isotope tracers to evaluate basic functional capabilities. The majority of the founder species did not maintain high relative abundances in later stages of succession.

In differential alternative splicing, the relative abundance of transcript variants differs across sample types. Differential alternative splicing is common in animal systems and influences cellular development in many processes, but its extent and significance is not as well known in plants. To investigate alternative splicing in plants, we examined rice seedling RNA-Seq data that included approximately 40 million sequence alignments per library, three libraries per sample type, and four sample types: roots and shoots, each treated with exogenous cytokinin delivered hydroponically, plus mock-treated controls. Cytokinin treatment triggered expression changes in thousands of genes, but had minimal effect on alternative splicing. However, there were many splicing differences between roots and shoots. Analysis of a similar (but less deeply sequenced) mRNA-Seq data set from Arabidopsis showed the same pattern. Quantitative fragment analysis of reverse transcriptase-PCR products made from newly prepared rice samples confirmed nine of ten differential splicing events between rice roots and shoots. In both the Arabidopsis and rice mRNA-Seq data sets, most genes annotated as alternatively spliced had small minor variant frequencies, i.e., the less frequently observed forms were supported by fewer than 20% of informative mRNA-Seq sequences. Of splicing choices where there was more abundant support for minor forms, most alternative splicing events were located within the protein-coding sequence and also maintained the annotated reading frame. A tool for visualizing protein annotations in the context of genomic sequence (ProtAnnot) together with a genome browser (Integrated Genome Browser) were used to visualize and assess effects of differential splicing on gene function. In general, differentially spliced regions coincided with conserved regions in the encoded proteins, indicating that differential alternative splicing is likely to affect protein function between root and shoot tissue in rice.","10.1002/pld3.136"

In contrast, Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) is a potent inhibitor of glucose uptake and is frequently downregulated in human cancers. Our lab previously discovered that Ras activation suppresses TXNIP transcription and translation. In this report, we developed a system to study how Ras affects TXNIP translation in the absence of transcriptional affects. We show that whereas Ras drives a global increase in protein translation, it suppresses TXNIP protein synthesis by reducing the rate at which ribosomes transit the coding region of TXNIP mRNA. To investigate the underlying mechanism(s), we randomized or optimized the codons in the TXNIP message without altering the TXNIP primary amino acid sequence. Translation from these mRNA variants is still repressed by Ras, intimating that mRNA secondary structure, miRNAs, RNA binding proteins, or codon usage do not contribute to the blockade of TXNIP synthesis. Rather, we show that the N-terminus of the growing TXNIP polypeptide is the target for Ras-dependent translational repression. Our work demonstrates how Ras suppresses TXNIP translation elongation in the face of a global upregulation of protein synthesis and provides new insight into Ras-dependent metabolic reprogramming.","10.1128/mcb.00178-18"

Although initially described as a direct myosin activator, subsequent studies are at odds with this description and do not explain OM-mediated increases in cardiac output. Single-molecule, biophysical experiments on cardiac myosin show that OM suppresses myosins working stroke and prolongs actomyosin attachment 5-fold, which explain inhibitory actions of the drug observed in vitro. Surprisingly, the increased myocardial force output in the presence of OM can be explained by cooperative thin filament activation by OM-inhibited myosin molecules. Selective suppression of myosin is an unanticipated route to muscle activation that may guide future development of therapeutic drugs.","10.1038/s41467-018-06193-2"

However, methodologies to evaluate the statistical error of these distributions are not standard, often hampering a rigorous interpretation of the experimental results. Distance distributions are often determined from the experimental DEER data through a mathematical method known as Tikhonov regularization, but this approach makes rigorous error estimates difficult. Here, we build upon an alternative model-based approach in which the distance probability distribution is represented as a sum of Gaussian components and use propagation of errors to calculate an associated confidence band. Our approach considers all sources of uncertainty, including the experimental noise, the uncertainty in the fitted background signal, and the limited time-span of the data collection. The resulting confidence band reveals the most and least reliable features of the probability distribution, thereby informing the structural interpretation of DEER experiments. To facilitate this interpretation, we also generalize the molecular-simulation method known as Ensemble-Biased Metadynamics. This method, originally designed to generate maximum-entropy structural ensembles consistent with one or more probability distributions, now also accounts for the uncertainty in those target distributions, exactly as dictated by their confidence bands. After careful benchmarks, we demonstrate the proposed techniques using DEER results from spin-labeled T4 lysozyme.","10.1016/j.bpj.2018.08.008"

We have expressed humanized L1 and L2 viral capsid proteins in HEK293T epithelial human cells, transiently transfecting them with vectors encoding humanized HPVL1 and L2 genes. Recombinant L1/L2 capsid proteins and structured virus-like particles interacted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells - lymphocytes and monocytes - and were internalised through a pathway involving CD71 transferrin receptors. This was observed, at a percentile of about 54% T-CD4, 47% T-CD8, 48% B-CD20, and 23% for monocytes-CD14. The group of polymorph nuclear cells: neutrophils-eosinophils-basophils group did not internalise any VLPs.

Expression of SORLA in cancer cell lines and bladder cancers correlates with HER2 levels. Depletion of SORLA targets HER2 to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments, impairs HER2-driven signaling and in vivo tumor growth. SORLA silencing also disrupts normal lysosome function and sensitizes anti-HER2 therapy sensitive and resistant cancer cells to lysosome-targeting cationic amphiphilic drugs.

We found that small differences in SOX2 and OCT4 levels impact cell fate commitment in G1 but not in S phase. Elevated SOX2 levels modestly increased neuroectodermal commitment and decreased mesendodermal commitment upon directed differentiation.

We analysed seasonal single-seed removal by granivorous birds from 300 experimental devices in the algarrobal of the central Monte desert. Spatial selectivity was analysed by comparing the structural characteristics of used vs. available microhabitats and evaluated against bottom-up and top-down hypotheses based on our previous knowledge on local seed bank abundance, composition and dynamics. Seed removal, which showed its expected seasonal variability, was also explored for spatial autocorrelation and environmental dependencies at bigger scales. Postdispersal granivorous birds were less selective in their use of foraging space than expected if patch appearance were providing them useful information to guide their search for profitable foraging patches. No kind of microhabitat, as defined by their vegetation and soil structure, was safe from bird exploration. The only consistent selective pattern at this scale was closer to a top-down spatial effect by birds, i.e., a cause (and not a consequence) of the seed bank dynamics. Bigger spatial scales proved more relevant to describe heterogeneity in the use of foraging patches in this habitat. Closeness to tall trees, probably related to bird territoriality and reproduction or to their perception of predation risk, seems to determine a first level of selection that defines explorable space, and then microhabitat openness exerts an influence on which patches are effectively exploited (or more frequently explored) among those accessible.","NA"

Little is known, however, about host-symbiont dynamics in these important relationships, and whether these symbioses constitute mutualisms is debated. In this study, we applied single-cell sequencing methods and advanced fluorescent microscopy to investigate host-symbiont dynamics in clade F acantharians, a major group of photosymbiotic protists in oligotrophic subtropical gyres. We amplified the 18S rRNA gene from single acantharian hosts and environmental samples to assess intra-host symbiont diversity and to determine whether intra-host symbiont community composition directly reflects the available symbiont community in the surrounding environment. Our results demonstrate that clade F acantharians simultaneously host multiple species from the haptophyte genera Phaeocystis and Chrysochromulina. The intra-host symbiont community composition was distinct from the external free-living symbiont community, suggesting that these acantharians maintain symbionts for extended periods of time. After selective staining of digestive organelles, fluorescent confocal microscopy showed that symbionts were not being systematically digested, which is consistent with extended symbiont maintenance within hosts. Extended maintenance within hosts may benefit symbionts through protection from grazing or viral lysis, and therefore dispersal, provided that symbionts retain reproductive capacity.","10.3389/fmicb.2018.01998"

As the mutations spread concurrently through the population, they leave behind characteristic patterns of polymorphism near selected loci--so-called soft sweeps--which remain visible after adaptation is complete. These patterns are well-understood in two limits of the spreading dynamics of beneficial mutations: the panmictic case with complete absence of spatial structure, and spreading via short-ranged or diffusive dispersal events, which tessellates space into distinct compact regions each descended from a unique mutation. However, spreading behaviour in most natural populations is not exclusively panmictic or diffusive, but incorporates both short-range and long-range dispersal events. Here, we characterize the spatial patterns of soft sweeps driven by dispersal events whose jump distances are broadly distributed, using lattice-based simulations and scaling arguments. We find that mutant clones adopt a distinctive structure consisting of compact cores surrounded by fragmented \""haloes\"" which mingle with haloes from other clones. As long-range dispersal becomes more prominent, the progression from diffusive to panmictic behaviour is marked by two transitions separating regimes with differing relative sizes of halo to core. We analyze the implications of the core-halo structure for the statistics of soft sweep detection in small genomic samples from the population, and find opposing effects of long-range dispersal on the expected diversity in global samples compared to local samples from geographic subregions of the range. We also discuss consequences of the standing genetic variation induced by the soft sweep on future adaptation and mixing.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007936"

T1-weighted brain scans (n=21297, 16 cohorts) were processed with the hippocampal subfields algorithm in FreeSurfer v6.0. We ran a genome-wide association analysis on each subfield, covarying for total hippocampal volume.

All outcome measures were corrected for age, sex, and intracranial volume. We found 15 unique genome-wide significant loci across six subfields, of which eight had not been previously linked to the hippocampus. Top SNPs were mapped to genes associated with neuronal differentiation, locomotor behaviour, schizophrenia and AD. The volumes of all the subfields were estimated to be heritable (h2 from .14 to .27, all p< 1x10-16) and clustered together based on their genetic correlations compared to other structural brain features. There was also evidence of genetic overlap of subicular subfield volumes with schizophrenia.

Failure in such balance leads to a range of severe intestinal and systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases, food allergies or invasive gastrointestinal infections1,2. Multiple innate and adaptive immune mechanisms are therefore in place to maintain tissue integrity, including efficient peripheral generation of effector T (TH) cells and FOXP3+ regulatory T (pTreg) cells, which mediate resistance to pathogens and regulate excessive immune activation, respectively2-5. The gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) are critical sites for orchestrating adaptive immunity to luminal perturbations6-8.

Here we report that individual mLNs are anatomically and immunologically distinct according to the functional gut segment they drain. Dendritic cell gene signatures and adaptive T cell polarization against the same luminal antigen differed between mLNs along the intestine, the proximal small intestine-draining mLNs preferentially giving rise to tolerogenic and the distal mLNs to pro-inflammatory T cell responses. This compartmentalized dichotomy could be perturbed by duodenal infection, surgical removal of select distal mLNs, dysbiosis, or ectopic antigen delivery, impacting both lymphoid organ and tissue immune responses.

Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wildtype virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectors - which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines - induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wildtype virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific T cells responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus as well as a hemagglutinin-specific T cell response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a several-fold enhancement of this immune response.\n\nIMPORTANCEWe hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and of activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above hypothesis as well as suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.","10.1128/jvi.00616-18"

We administered Maraviroc (MVC) to rhesus macaques (RMs) to block CCR5-mediated entry, followed by repeated oral exposure of a CCR5-dependent clone of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)mac251 (SIVmac766). MVC significantly blocked the CCR5 coreceptor in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tissue cells. All control animals and 60% of MVC-treated infant RMs became infected by the 6th challenge, with no significant difference between the number of exposures (p=0.15). At the time of viral exposures, MVC plasma and tissue (including tonsil) concentrations were within the range seen in humans receiving MVC as a therapeutic. Both treated and control RMs were infected with only a single transmitted/founder variant, consistent with the dose of virus typical of HIV-1 infection. The uninfected RMs expressed the lowest levels of CCR5 on the CD4+ T cells. Ramp-up viremia was significantly delayed (p=0.05) in the MVC-treated RMs, yet peak and postpeak viral loads were similar in treated and control RMs. In conclusion, in spite of apparent effective CCR5 blockade in infant RMs, MVC had marginal impact on acquisition and only a minimal impact on post infection delay of viremia following oral SIV infection. Newly developed, more effective CCR5 blockers may have a more dramatic impact on oral SIV transmission than MVC.\n\nImportanceWe have previously suggested that the very low levels of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) maternal-to-infant transmissions (MTIT) in African nonhuman primates that are natural hosts of SIVs are due to a low availability of target cells (CCR5+ CD4+ T cells) in the oral mucosa of the infants, rather than maternal and milk factors. To confirm this new MTIT paradigm, we performed a proof of concept study, in which we therapeutically blocked CCR5 with maraviroc (MVC) and orally exposed MVC treated and naive infant rhesus macaques to SIV. MVC had only a marginal effect on oral SIV transmission. However, the observation that the infant RMs that remained uninfected at the completion of the study, after 6 repeated viral challenges, had the lowest CCR5 expression on the CD4+ T cells prior to the MVC treatment, appear to confirm our hypothesis, also suggesting that the partial effect of MVC is due to a limited efficacy of the drug. Newly, more effective CCR5 inhibitors may have a better effect in preventing SIV and HIV transmission.","10.1128/jvi.00576-18"

This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a nested-PCR to amplify the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) to detect Leishmania DNA in paired saliva and buffy coat samples of 305 Thai patients with HIV/AIDS in Trang Hospital, Trang Province, southern Thailand. For asymptomatic Leishmania infection among Thai patients with HIV/AIDS, the sensitivity and specificity of the nested-PCR-ITS1 in buffy coat were 73.9 and 100%, respectively. However, the sensitivity in saliva was 26.1% and specificity was 100%. Using the nested-PCR-ITS1, saliva and buffy coat samples showed positive agreement in only 52.0% of patients. Saliva tested results with the nested-PCR-ITS1 showed positive agreement with the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) in 46.5% of patients. Only 12.1% of the samples showed positive agreement for Leishmania infection among all the three tests: saliva, buffy coat and DAT results. Using nucleotide sequencing, at least three species of Leishmania infection were identified in saliva, i.e., L. siamensis (n=28), L. martiniquensis (n=9), and L. donovani complex (n=1). As a result, buffy coat still appears to be a better specimen to diagnose asymptomatic VL infection among individuals with HIV. However, the use of both buffy coat and saliva together as clinical specimens would increase the sensitivity of Leishmania detection.","10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.06.006"

In the model organism Caulobacter crescentus PhyR was proposed to be phosphorylated by the histidine kinase PhyK, but biochemical evidence in support of such a role of PhyK is missing. Here, we identify a single-domain response regulator, MrrA, that is essential for general stress response activation in C. crescentus. We demonstrate that PhyK does not function as a kinase but accepts phosphoryl groups from MrrA and passes them on to PhyR, thereby adopting the role of a histidine phosphotransferase. MrrA is phosphorylated by at least six histidine kinases that likely serve as stress sensors. MrrA also transfers phosphate to LovK, a histidine kinase involved in C. crescentus holdfast production and attachment, that also negatively regulates the general stress response. We show that LovK together with the response regulator LovR acts as a phosphate sink to redirect phosphate flux away from the PhyKR branch. In agreement with the biochemical data, a mrrA mutant is unable to activate the general stress response and shows a hyper-attachment phenotype, which is linked to decreased expression of the major holdfast inhibitory protein HfiA. We propose that MrrA serves as a central phosphorylation hub that coordinates the general stress response with C. crescentus development and other adaptive behaviors. The characteristic bow-tie architecture of this phosphorylation network with MrrA as the central knot may expedite the evolvability and species-specific niche adaptation of this group of bacteria.\n\nImportanceTwo-component systems (TCSs) consisting of a histidine kinase and a cognate response regulator are predominant signal transduction systems in bacteria. To avoid cross-talk, TCS are generally thought to be highly insulated from each other. However, this notion is based largely on studies of the HisKA subfamily of histidine kinases, while little information is available for the HWE and HisKA2 subfamilies. The latter have been implicated in the alpha-proteobacterial general stress response. Here, we show that in the model organism Caulobacter crescentus an atypical FATGUY-type single-domain response regulator (SDRR), MrrA, is highly promiscuous both in accepting and transferring phosphoryl groups from and to a number of up- and downstream kinases, challenging the current view of strictly insulated TCSs. Instead, we propose that FATGUY response regulators have evolved in alpha-proteobacteria to serve as central phosphorylation hubs to broadly sample information and distribute phosphoryl groups between the general stress response pathway and other TCSs, thereby coordinating multiple cellular behaviors. This signaling cascade includes presumable histidine kinases harboring intact catalytic and ATP-binding (CA) domains that, however, do not function as kinases, but instead have adopted a role as histidine phosphotransferases. Our work highlights a complex phosphorylation network in alpha-proteobacteria that coordinates the general stress response with changes in other cellular behaviors and development.","10.1128/mbio.00809-18"

The location of microbial detoxification along the gut could have profound influences on the distribution, metabolism, and tolerance to toxic compounds. Stephens woodrats (Neotoma stephensi) specialize on juniper, which is heavily defended by numerous defensive compounds, such as oxalate, phenolics, and monoterpenes. Woodrats maintain two gut chambers harboring dense microbial communities: a foregut chamber proximal to the major site of toxin absorption, and a cecal chamber in their hindgut. We performed several experiments to investigate the location of microbial detoxification in the woodrat gut. First, we measured levels of toxins across gut chambers. Compared to food material, oxalate concentrations were immediately lower in the foregut chamber, while concentrations of terpenes remain high in the foregut, and are lowest in the cecal chamber. We also conducted metagenomic sequencing of the foregut and cecal chambers to compare microbial functions. We found that the majority of genes associated with detoxification functions were more abundant in the cecal chamber. However, some genes associated with degradation of oxalate and phenolic compounds were more abundant in the foregut. Thus, it seems that microbial detoxification may take place in various chambers depending on the class of chemical compound. We hypothesize that the location of microbial detoxification could impact the tolerance of animals to these compounds, which may have ecological and evolutionary consequences.","10.1093/femsec/fiy184"

Many of the hurdles that have prevented a better understanding of these symbionts arise from variation among protist and termite host species and the inability to maintain prominent community members in culture. These issues have made it difficult to study the fidelity, acquisition, and differences in colonization of protists by bacterial symbionts. In this study, we use high throughput amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes to determine the composition of bacterial communities associated with single protist cells of six protist species, from the genera Pyrsonympha, Dinenympha, and Trichonympha that are present in the hindgut of the termite Reticulitermes flavipes. By analyzing amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), the diversity and distribution of protist-associated bacteria was compared within and across these six different protist species. ASV analysis showed that, in general, each protist genus associated with a distinct community of bacterial symbionts which were conserved across different termite colonies. However, some ASVs corresponding to ectosymbionts (Spirochaetes) were shared between different Dinenympha species and to a lesser extent with Pyrsonympha and Trichonympha hosts. This suggested that certain bacterial symbionts may be cosmopolitan to some degree and perhaps acquired by horizontal transmission. Using a fluorescence-based cell assay, we could observe the horizontal acquisition of surface-bound bacteria. This acquisition was shown to be time-dependent, involve active processes, and was non-random with respect to binding locations on some protists.","NA"

We showed the high efficacy of cytarabine in the growth inhibition of various PEL cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Cytarabine inhibited host DNA and RNA syntheses and therefore induced cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, cytarabine inhibited viral DNA and RNA syntheses and induced the the rapid degradation of KSHV major latent protein LANA, leading to the suppression of KSHV latent replication. Importantly, cytarabine effectively inhibited active KSHV replication and virion production in PEL cells. Finally, cytarabine treatments not only effectively inhibited the initiation and progression of PEL tumors, but also induced regression of grown PEL tumors in a xenograft mouse model. Together, our study has identified cytarabine as novel therapeutic agent for treating PEL as well as eliminating KSHV persistent infection.\n\nImportancePrimary effusion lymphoma is an aggressive malignancy caused by Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. The outcome of primary effusion lymphoma is dismal without specific treatment. Through a high throughput screening of characterized compounds, we identified a FDA-approved compound cytarabine as a potent inhibitor of primary effusion lymphoma. We showed that cytarabine induced regression of PEL tumors in a xenograft mouse model. Cytarabine inhibited host and viral DNA and RNA syntheses, resulting in the induction of cytotoxicity. Of interest, cytarabine induced the degradation of KSHV major latent protein LANA, hence suppressing KSHV latent replication, which is required for PEL survival. Furthermore, cytarabine inhibited KSHV lytic replication program, preventing virion production. Our findings identified cytarabine as novel therapeutic agent for treating PEL as well as for eliminating KSHV persistent infection.

However, purposefully designing attenuated viruses remains challenging, in particular if the attenuation is meant to be resistant to rapid evolutionary recovery. Here we develop and analyze a new attenuation method, promoter ablation, using an established viral model, bacteriophage T7. Ablating promoters of the two most highly expressed T7 proteins (scaffold and capsid) led to major reductions in transcript abundance of the affected genes, with the effect of the double knockout approximately additive of the effects of single knockouts. Fitness reduction was moderate and also approximately additive; fitness recovery on extended adaptation was partial and did not restore the promoters. The fitness effect of promoter knockouts combined with a previously tested codon deoptimization of the capsid gene was less than additive, as anticipated from their competing mechanisms of action. In one design, the engineering created an unintended consequence that led to further attenuation, the effect of which was studied and understood in hindsight. Overall, the mechanisms and effects of genome engineering on attenuation behaved in a predictable manner. Therefore, this work suggests that the rational design of viral attenuation methods is becoming feasible.\n\nImportanceLive viral vaccines rely on attenuated viruses that can successfully infect their host but have reduced fitness or virulence. Such attenuated viruses were originally developed through trial- and-error, typically by adaptation of the wild-type virus to novel conditions. That method was haphazard, with no way of controlling the degree of attenuation, the number of attenuating mutations, or preventing evolutionary reversion. Synthetic biology now enables rational design and engineering of viral attenuation, but rational design must be informed by biological principles to achieve stable, quantitative attenuation. This work shows that in a model system for viral attenuation, bacteriophage T7, attenuation can be obtained from rational design principles, and multiple different attenuation approaches can be combined for enhanced overall effect.","10.1128/msystems.00046-18"

Studies demonstrating a major burden of ST-producing ETEC have focused interest on ST toxoids for ETEC vaccines. We therefore examined fundamental aspects of ETEC ST biology using ETEC H10407, which carries estH and estP genes encoding ST-H and ST-P, respectively, in addition to eltAB genes responsible for LT. In this background, we found that deletion of estH significantly diminished cGMP activation in target epithelia, while deletion of estP had a surprisingly modest impact, and a dual estH/estP mutant was not appreciably different than the estH mutant. Nevertheless, either ST-H or ST-P recombinant peptides stimulated cGMP production. We also found that the TolC efflux protein was essential for both toxin secretion and delivery, providing a potential avenue for efflux inhibitors in treatment of acute diarrheal illness. In addition, we demonstrated that the EtpA adhesin is required for optimal delivery of ST and that antibodies against either the adhesin or ST-H significantly impaired toxin delivery and cGMP activation in target T84 cells. Finally, we used FLAG epitope fusions to demonstrate that the ST-H pro-peptide sequence is secreted by the bacteria, potentially providing additional targets for antibody neutralization.

During virion assembly, gO and the UL128-131 proteins compete for binding to gH/gL in the ER. This assembly process clearly differs among strains since Merlin (ME) virions contain abundant gH/gL/UL128-131 and little gH/gL/gO, whereas TR contains much higher levels of total gH/gL, mostly in the form of gH/gL/gO, but much less gH/gL/UL128-131 than ME. Remaining questions include 1) what are the mechanisms behind these assembly differences, and 2) do differences reflect in vitro culture adaptations or natural genetic variations? Since the UL74(gO) ORF differs by 25% of amino acids between TR and ME, we analyzed recombinant viruses in which the UL74(gO) ORF was swapped. TR virions were >40-fold more infectious than ME. Transcriptional repression of UL128-131 enhanced infectivity of ME to the level of TR, despite still far lower levels of gH/gL/gO. Swapping the UL74(gO) ORF had no effect on either TR or ME. A quantitative immunoprecipitation approach revealed that gH/gL expression was within 4-fold between TR and ME, but gO expression was 20-fold less by ME, and suggested differences in mRNA transcription, translation or rapid ER-associated degradation of gO. Trans-complementation of gO expression during ME replication gave 6-fold enhancement of infectivity beyond the 40-fold effect of UL128-131 repression alone. Overall, strain variations in assembly of gH/gL complexes result from differences in expression of gO and UL128-131, and selective advantages for reduced UL128-131 expression during fibroblast propagation are much stronger than for higher gO expression.\n\nIMPORTANCESpecific genetic differences between independently isolated HCMV strains may result from purifying selection on de novo mutations arising during propagation in culture, or random sampling among the diversity of genotypes present in clinical specimens. Results presented indicate that while reduced UL128-131 expression may confer a powerful selective advantage during cell-free propagation of HCMV in fibroblast cultures, selective pressures for increased gO expression are much weaker. Thus, variation in gO expression among independent strains may represent natural genotype variability present in vivo. This may have important implications for virus-host interactions such as immune recognition, and underscores the value of studying molecular mechanisms of replication using multiple HCMV strains.","10.1128/jvi.00606-18"

A 33.5-kb nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is ~200 kb. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps on the road to DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of size constraints on RNP entities. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20-34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with a proofreading exoribonuclease encoded in the nidoviral open reading frame 1b (ORF1b). However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region, and overall 41.1 kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, and key replicative domains. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and subsequently acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts. PSCNVs greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique features - impressive in themselves - attest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery.\n\nSignificance StatementRNA viruses are the only known RNA-protein (RNP) entities capable of autonomous replication.

Here, we describe a nidovirus from planarians, whose 41.1 kb genome is 23% larger than the largest known of RNA virus. The planarian secretory cell nidovirus has broken apparent constraints on the size of the genomic subregion that encodes core replication machinery, and has acquired genes not previously observed in RNA viruses.

TSPO is expressed throughout the brain, and for this reason no true reference region exists. When a radioligand does not have a reference region, an arterial input function (AIF) is usually required in order to quantify binding. However, obtaining an AIF can be difficult as well as uncomfortable for participants. Alternative methods have therefore been proposed with the aim of estimating (R)-[11C]PK11195 binding without arterial measurements, such as standardized uptake values (SUVs), supervised-cluster analysis (SVCA), or the use of a pseudo-reference region. The objective of this study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability and convergent validity of these techniques.\n\nMethodsData from a previously published (R)-[11C]PK11195 test-retest study in six healthy male subjects were reanalysed. Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated for a set of cortical and subcortical brain regions using the simplified reference tissue model, with either cerebellum as reference region or a reference input derived using SVCA. SUVs were estimated for the time interval of 40-60 minutes. For comparison, total distribution volume (VT), specific distribution volume (VS) and BPND were estimated from the two-tissue-compartment model (2TCM) using AIF. Test-retest reliability was then assessed for all outcome measures. Convergent validity was examined by correlating all measures derived without an AIF to those derived using 2TCM.\n\nResultsTest-retest reliability for BPND estimates were poor (80% of all regional ICCs<0.5). SUVs showed, on average, moderate reliability. BPND estimates derived without an AIF were not correlated with VT, VS or BPND from the 2TCM (all R2<12%).

SUVs showed moderate reliability but no convergent validity with any other outcome.

Projection-specific and bidirectional chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations revealed the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) supports the BLA in these processes. Critically, the function of ventrolateral (lOFC) and medial (mOFC) OFC[-&gt;]BLA projections was found to be doubly dissociable. Whereas activity in lOFC[-&gt;]BLA projections is necessary for and sufficient to drive encoding of a positive change in the value of a reward, mOFC[-&gt;]BLA projections are necessary and sufficient for retrieving this value from memory to guide its pursuit. These data reveal a new circuit for adaptive reward valuation and pursuit, indicate dissociability in the encoding and retrieval of reward memories, and provide insight into the dysfunction in these processes that characterizes myriad psychiatric diseases.","10.1038/s41593-019-0374-7"

It is currently unclear to what extent these hallmarks associate with symptoms of disease at extreme ages. Forty centenarians from the 100-plus Study cohort agreed to post-mortem brain donation. Centenarians self-reported to be cognitive healthy at baseline, which was confirmed by a proxy. Objective ante-mortem measurements of cognitive performance were associated with the prevalence, distribution and quantity of age- and AD-related neuropathological hallmarks. Despite self-reported cognitive health, objective neuropsychological testing suggested varying levels of ante-mortem cognitive functioning. Post-mortem, we found that most neuropathological hallmarks related to age and neurodegenerative diseases such as A{beta} and Tau pathology, as well as atherosclerosis, were abundantly present in most or all centenarians, whereas Lewy body and pTDP-43 pathology were scarce. We observed that increased pathology loads correlated across pathology subtypes, and an overall trend of higher pathology loads to associate with a lower cognitive test performance. This trend was carried especially by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) and to a lesser extent by A{beta}-associated pathologies. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) specifically associated with lower executive functioning in the centenarians. In conclusion, we find that while the centenarians in this cohort escaped or delayed cognitive impairment until extreme ages, their brains reveal varying levels of disease-associated neuropathological hallmarks, some of which associate with cognitive performance.","10.1186/s40478-018-0558-5"

Kaas","Maastricht University","2018-04-11",1,"15","new results","neuroscience","Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising non-invasive method for brain computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs translate brain activity into signals that allow communication with the outside world. Visual and motor imagery are often used as information-encoding strategies, but can be challenging if not grounded in recent experience in these modalities, e.g. in patients with locked-in-syndrome (LIS). In contrast, somatosensory imagery might constitute a more suitable information-encoding strategy as somatosensory function is often very robust. Somatosensory imagery has been shown to activate somatotopic cortex, but it has been unclear so far whether it can be reliably detected on a single-trial level and successfully classified according to specific somatosensory imagery content.\n\nUsing ultra-high field 7-T fMRI, we show reliable and high-accuracy single-trial decoding of left-foot vs. right-hand somatosensory imagery. Correspondingly, higher decoding accuracies were associated with greater spatial separation of hand and foot decoding-weight patterns in primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Exploiting these novel neuroscientific insights, we developed - and provide a proof of concept for - basic BCI communication by showing that binary (yes/no) answers encoded by somatosensory imagery can be decoded with high accuracy not only offline but also in real-time.\n\nThis study demonstrates that body part-specific somatosensory imagery differentially activates somatosensory cortex in a topographically specific manner; evidence which was surprisingly still lacking in the literature. It is also offers a promising novel somatosensory imagery based fMRI-BCI control strategy, with particularly high potential for visually and motor-impaired patients. The strategy could also be transferred to lower MRI field strengths and to mobile functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Finally, given that communication BCIs provide the BCI user with a form of feedback based on their brain signals and can thus be considered as a specific form of neurofeedback, and that repeated use of a BCI has been shown to enhance underlying representations, we expect that the current BCI could also offer an interesting new approach for somatosensory rehabilitation training in the context of stroke and phantom limb pain.","10.3389/fnhum.2019.00427"

Periodic oscillations have been widely studied and linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and disease states, while the aperiodic \""background\"" 1/f component of neural power spectra has received far less attention. Most analyses of oscillations are conducted on a priori, canonically-defined frequency bands without consideration of the underlying aperiodic structure, or verification that a periodic signal even exists in addition to the aperiodic signal. This is problematic, as recent evidence shows that the aperiodic signal is dynamic, changing with age, task demands, and cognitive state. It has also been linked to the relative excitation/inhibition of the underlying neuronal population. This means that standard analytic approaches easily conflate changes in the periodic and aperiodic signals with one another because the aperiodic parameters--along with oscillation center frequency, power, and bandwidth--are all dynamic in physiologically meaningful, but likely different, ways. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional narrowband analyses and to reduce the potentially deleterious effects of conflating these features, we introduce a novel algorithm for automatic parameterization of neural power spectral densities (PSDs) as a combination of the aperiodic signal and putative periodic oscillations. Notably, this algorithm requires no a priori specification of band limits and accounts for potentially-overlapping oscillations while minimizing the degree to which they are confounded with one another. This algorithm is amenable to large-scale data exploration and analysis, providing researchers with a tool to quickly and accurately parameterize neural power spectra.","NA"

To correct this flaw, we developed a methodological approach called maximal homology alignment (MHA). The goal of MHA is to rescue internal microparalogy of biological sequences rather than to insert a pattern of gaps (null characters), which transform homologous sequences into strings of uniform size (1-dimensional lengths). The core operation in MHA is the \""cinch\"", whereby inferred tandem microparalogy is represented in multiple rows across the same span of alignment columns. Thus, MHAs have a second (vertical) paralogy dimension, which re-categorizes most indel mutations as replication slippage and attenuates the indel problem. Furthermore, internally-cinched, inferred microparalogy in a self-MHA can later be relaxed to restore uniformity to 2-dimensional widths in a multiple sequence alignment. This de-cinching operation is used as a first resort before artificial null characters are used. We implement MHA in a program called maximal, which is composed of a series of modules for cinching and cyclelizing divergent tandem repeats. In conclusion, we find that the MHA approach is of higher utility than GA in non-protein-coding regulatory sequences, which are unconstrained by codon-based reading frames and are enriched in dense microparalogical content.","NA"

In this study, we investigated the role and anti-infection mechanism of sublancin in a mouse model of MRSA-induced sublethal infection. Sublancin could modulate innate immunity by inducing the production of IL-1{beta}, IL-6, TNF- and nitric oxide, enhancing phagocytosis and MRSA-killing activity in both RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages. The enhanced macrophage function by the peptide in vitro correlated with stronger protective activity in vivo in the MRSA-invasive sublethal infection model. Macrophages activation by sublancin was found to be mediated through the TLR4 and the NF-{kappa}B and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, oral administration of sublancin increased the frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes. The protective activity of sublancin was associated with in vivo augmenting phagocytotic activity of peritoneal macrophages and partly improving T cell-mediated immunity.

Furthermore, eupatilin-induced growth arrest and morphological changes in primary fibroblasts derived from a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). To better understand fibrosis, we established a mouse hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line that was robustly differentiated into myofibroblasts upon treatment with TGF{beta}. HSC-derived fibrogenesis was completely blocked by eupatilin, which caused dramatic morphological changes while inhibiting expression of EMT-related genes. The chemical groups linked to the 2nd carbon (C2), C3, C6, and C7 on the CS of eupatilin were essential for its anti-fibrogenic effects. Unlike eupatilin, pirfenidone failed to block HSC fibrogenesis and did not affect the morphology of HSCs or lung fibroblasts. Although pirfenidone affected local production of TGF{beta}, as reflected by a reduction in the TGF{beta} level in lung lysates of BILF model mice, eupatilin is likely to act via a different therapeutic mechanism. In particular, eupatilin had greater anti-fibrotic capacity and EMT-inhibitory activity and significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of Erk by TGF{beta}. Based on the interactome, Integrin{beta}3 seems to be a major player in integration of TGF{beta} signaling into the eupatilin-mediated anti-fibrosis. Our findings suggest that combinatorial use of eupatilin and pirfenidone may augment the therapeutic efficacy of IPF treatment.","NA"

Large uncertainty, however, surrounds the quantification of the actual risk of ZIKV introduction and autochthonous transmission across different areas of the US.\n\nMethodWe present a framework for the projection of ZIKV autochthonous transmission in the continental US during the 2015-2016 epidemic, using a data-driven stochastic and spatial epidemic model accounting for seasonal, environmental and detailed population data. The model generates an ensemble of travel-related case counts and simulate their potential to trigger local transmission at individual level.\n\nResultsWe estimate the risk of ZIKV introduction and local transmission at the county level and at the 0.025{degrees} x 0.025{degrees} cell level across the continental US. We provide a risk measure based on the probability of observing local transmission in a specific location during a ZIKV epidemic modeled after the one observed during the years 2015-2016. The high spatial and temporal resolutions of the model allow us to generate statistical estimates of the number of ZIKV introductions leading to local transmission in each location. We find that the risk is spatially heterogeneously distributed and concentrated in a few specific areas that account for less than 1% of the continental US population. Locations in Texas and Florida that have actually experienced local ZIKV transmission are among the places at highest risk according to our results. We also provide an analysis of the key determinants for local transmission, and identify the key introduction routes and their contributions to ZIKV spread in the continental US.\n\nConclusionsThis framework provides quantitative risk estimates, fully captures the stochas-ticity of ZIKV introduction events, and is not biased by the under-ascertainment of cases due to asymptomatic infections. It provides general information on key risk determinants and data with potential uses in defining public health recommendations and guidance about ZIKV risk in the US.","NA"

High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and the mercury methyltransferase, hgcA, combined with geochemical characterisation of soils, were used to determine the microbial populations contributing to MeHg formation in forest soils across Sweden. The hgcA sequences obtained were distributed among diverse clades, including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Methanomicrobia, with Deltaproteobacteria, particularly Geobacteraceae, dominating the libraries across all soils examined. Our results also suggest that MeHg formation is linked to the composition of also non-mercury methylating bacterial communities, likely providing growth substrate (e.g. acetate) for the hgcA-carrying microorganisms responsible for the actual methylation process.

Our in-silico analysis highlights the intrinsic differences and important similarities between the pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and frameshift mutations. We show that pathogenic SNVs are more likely to cause gene pleiotropy than pathogenic frameshift mutations and are enriched on the protein interaction interfaces. Functional profiling of SNVs indicates widespread disruption of the protein-protein interactions and synergistic effects of SNVs. The coverage of our approach is several times greater than the recently published experimental study and has the minimal overlap with it, while the distributions of determined edgotypes between the two sets of profiled mutations are remarkably similar.

Agard","Howard Hughes Medical Institute / University of California San Francisco","2018-04-11",1,"4","new results","biochemistry","The Hsp90 protein family are ATP-dependent molecular chaperones that maintain protein homeostasis and regulate many essential cellular processes. Higher eukaryotic cells have organelle-specific Hsp90 paralogs that are adapted to each unique sub-cellular environment. The mitochondrial Hsp90, TRAP1, supports the folding and activity of electron transport components and is increasingly being appreciated as a critical player in mitochondrial signaling. It is well known that calcium plays an important regulatory role in mitochondria and can even accumulate to much higher concentrations than in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, we find that calcium can replace the requirement for magnesium to support TRAP1 ATPase activity. Using anomalous x-ray diffraction, we reveal a novel calcium-binding site within the TRAP1 nucleotide-binding pocket located near the ATP -phosphate and completely distinct from the magnesium site adjacent to the {beta} and {gamma}-phosphates. In the presence of magnesium, ATP hydrolysis by TRAP1, as with other Hsp90s, is non-cooperative, whereas calcium binding results in cooperative ATP hydrolysis by the two protomers within the Hsp90 dimer. The structural data suggest a mechanism for the cooperative behavior. Owing to the cooperativity, at high ATP concentrations, ATPase activity is higher with calcium, whereas the converse is true at low ATP concentrations. Integrating these observations, we propose a model where the divalent cations choice can control switching between non-cooperative and cooperative TRAP1 ATPase mechanisms in response ATP concentrations. This may facilitate coordination between cellular energetics, mitochondrial signaling, and protein homeostasis via alterations in the TRAP1 ATP-driven cycle.","10.1074/jbc.ra118.003562"

This study deciphers the impact of the TCS08 on pneumococcal gene expression and its role in metabolic and pathophysiological processes. Transcriptome analysis and real-time PCR demonstrated a regulatory effect of the TCS08 on genes involved mainly in environmental information processing, intermediary metabolism, and colonization by S. pneumoniae D39 and TIGR4. Striking examples are genes of the fatty acid biosynthesis, arginine-deiminase system, and psa operon encoding the manganese ABC transport system. In silico analysis confirmed that TCS08 is homologous to Staphylococcus aureus SaeRS and a SaeR-like binding motif is displayed in the promotor region of pavB, the upstream gene of the tcs08 operon encoding a surface-exposed adhesin. Indeed, PavB is regulated by the TCS08 as confirmed by immunoblotting and surface abundance assays. Similarly, Pilus-1 of TIGR4 is regulated by TCS08. Finally, in vivo infections using the acute pneumonia and sepsis models showed a strain dependent effect. Loss of function of HK08 or TCS08 attenuated D39 virulence in lung infections. The RR08 deficiency attenuated TIGR4 in pneumonia, while there was no effect on sepsis. In contrast, lack of HK08 procured a highly virulent TIGR4 phenotype in both pneumonia and sepsis infections. Taken together, these data indicate the importance of TCS08 in pneumococcal fitness to adapt to the milieu of the respiratory tract during colonization.\n\nIMPORTANCEStreptococcus pneumoniae interplays with its environment by using 13 two-component regulatory systems and one orphan response regulator. These systems are involved in the sensing of environmental signals thereby modulating pneumococcal pathophysiology. This study aimed to understand the functional role of genes subject to control by the TCS08. The identified genes play a role in transport of compounds such as sugars or amino acids. In addition, the intermediary metabolism and colonization factors are modulated by TCS08. Thus, TCS08 regulates genes involved in maintaining pneumococcal physiology, transport capacity and adhesive factors to enable optimal colonization, which represents a prerequisite for invasive pneumococcal disease.","10.1128/mSphere.00165-18"

Systemic RNAi, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ingestion, has been reported in diverse invertebrates, including honey bees, demonstrating environmental RNA uptake that undermines homologous gene expression. However, the question why any organism would take up RNA from the environment has remained largely unanswered. Here, we report on horizontal RNA flow among honey bees mediated by secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jelly diets. We show that ingested dsRNA spreads through the bees hemolymph associated with a protein complex. The systemic dsRNA is secreted with the jelly and delivered to larvae via ingestion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transmission of jelly-secreted dsRNA to larvae is biologically active and triggers gene knockdown that lasts into adulthood. Finally, RNA extracted from worker and royal jellies harbor differential naturally occurring RNA populations. Some of these RNAs corresponded to honey bee protein coding genes, transposable elements, non-coding RNA and exogenous viruses. These results reveal an inherent property of honey bees to share RNA among individuals and generations. Thus, our findings suggest a transmissible RNA pathway, playing a role in social immunity and epigenetic dynamics among honey bees and potentially other closely interacting organisms.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEHoney bees are eusocial insects, living in a colony that is often described as a superorganism. RNA mobility among cells of an organism has been documented in plants and animals. Here we show that RNA spreads further in honey bees, and is horizontally transferred between individuals and across generations. We found that honey bees share biologically active RNA through secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jellies. Such RNA initiated RNA interference, which is a known defense mechanism against viral infection. Furthermore, we characterized diverse RNA profiles of worker and royal jelly, including fragmented viral RNA.

Predictions are highly accurate across both synthetic and genomic contexts; when tasked with inferring APA in human 3UTRs, APARENT outperforms models trained exclusively on endogenous data. Visualizing features learned across all network layers reveals that APARENT recognizes sequence motifs known to recruit APA regulators, discovers previously unknown sequence determinants of cleavage site selection, and integrates these features into a comprehensive, interpretable cis-regulatory code.

Depending on geographic area and socio-economic conditions between 30 to nearly 100% of individuals are affected. The biology of this virus is difficult to explore due to its extreme sophistication and the lack of pertinent animal model. Here we present the first application of the ANCHOR DNA labeling system to a herpes virus, allowing real time imaging and direct monitoring of HCMV infection and replication in human living cells. The ANCHOR system is composed of a protein (OR) which specifically binds to a short, non-repetitive DNA target sequence (ANCH) and spreads onto neighboring sequences due to protein oligomerization. If OR protein is fused to GFP, this accumulation results in a site specific fluorescent focus. We have created a recombinant ANCHOR-HCMV harboring an ANCH target sequence and the gene encoding the cognate OR-GFP fusion protein. Infection of permissive cells with ANCHOR-HCMV enables visualization of the nearly complete viral cycle until cell fragmentation and death. Quantitative analysis of infection kinetics and of viral DNA replication revealed cell-type specific behavior of HCMV and sensitivity to inhibitors. Our results show that the ANCHOR technology is a very efficient tool for the study of complex DNA viruses and new highly promising biotechnology applications.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe ANCHOR technology is to date the most powerful tool to follow and quantify the replication of HCMV in living cells and to gain new insights into its biology. This technology is applicable to virtually any DNA virus or virus presenting a dsDNA phase, paving the way to infection imaging in various cell lines or even in animal models and opening fascinating fundamental and applied prospects. Associated to high content automated microscopy, this technology permitted rapid, robust and precise determination of Ganciclovir IC50 and IC90 on HCMV replication, with minimal hands-on investment. To search for new antiviral activities, the experiment is easy to up-grade towards efficient and cost-effective screening of large chemical libraries.

We used nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences of 156 individuals with the aim of unraveling their phylogenetic position, while microsatellite loci were used to compare several a priori insular biogeographic models of migration with empirical data. Our results suggest that the western Pontine populations colonized the islands early during their Pliocene volcanic formation, while populations from the eastern Pontine Islands seem to have been introduced recently. The inter-island genetic makeup indicates an important role of historical migration, probably due to glacial land bridges connecting islands followed by a recent vicariant mechanism of isolation. Moreover, the most supported migration model predicted higher gene flow among islands sharing a longitudinal arrangement. Considering the threatened status of small insular endemic populations, we suggest this new evolutionarily independent unit be given priority in conservation efforts.","NA"

To reduce costs, we switched from the standard protocol to a custom modified protocol (NanoCRCA) with a high Pearson correlation coefficient (>0.88) between protocols. Technical replicates were highly correlated (>0.96). The assay included a reduced robust 38-gene panel from the 786-gene signature that was selected using an in-laboratory developed computational pipeline of class prediction methods.

Presently, third generation sequencing platforms able to generate much longer reads are becoming more widespread. These platforms come with the significant drawback of higher sequencing error rates, which makes them ill-suited to current genotyping algorithms. However, the longer reads make more of the genome unambiguously mappable and typically provide linkage information between neighboring variants.\n\nResultsIn this paper we introduce a novel approach for haplotype-aware genotyping from noisy long reads. We do this by considering bipartitions of the sequencing reads, corresponding to the two haplotypes. We formalize the computational problem in terms of a Hidden Markov Model and compute posterior genotype probabilities using the forward-backward algorithm. Genotype predictions can then be made by picking the most likely genotype at each site. Our experiments indicate that longer reads allow significantly more of the genome to potentially be accurately genotyped.

Our empirical analyses of Ultraconserved Element (UCE) locus data collected from the South American hummingbird genus Topaza demonstrate that phased allele sequences carry sufficient phylogenetic information to infer the genetic structure, lineage divergence, and biogeographic history of a genus that diversified during the last three million years. The phylogenetic results support the recognition of two species, and suggest a high rate of gene flow across large distances of rainforest habitats but rare admixture across the Amazon River. Our simulations provide evidence that analyzing allele sequences leads to more accurate estimates of tree topology and divergence times than the more common approach of using contig sequences.","10.1093/sysbio/syy039"

In an era of unprecedented biodiversity loss and climate change, understanding both the determinants and consequences of bottlenecks in wild populations is therefore an increasingly important challenge. However, as most studies have focused on single species, the multitude of potential drivers and the consequences of bottlenecks remain elusive. Here, we used a comparative approach by integrating genetic data from over 11,000 individuals of 30 pinniped species with demographic, ecological and life history data to elucidate the consequences of large-scale commercial exploitation by 18th and 19th century sealers. We show that around one third of these species exhibit strong genetic signatures of recent population declines, with estimated bottleneck effective population sizes reflecting just a few tens of surviving individuals in the most extreme cases. Bottleneck strength was strongly associated with both breeding habitat and mating system variation, and together with global abundance explained a large proportion of the variation in genetic diversity across species. Overall, there was no relationship between bottleneck intensity and IUCN status, although three of the four most heavily bottlenecked species are currently endangered. Our study reveals an unforeseen interplay between anthropogenic exploitation, ecology, life history and demographic declines, sheds new light on the determinants of genetic diversity, and is consistent with the notion that both genetic and demographic factors influence population viability.","10.1038/s41467-018-06695-z"

Whereas scientific misconduct, like data fabrication, is clearly irresponsible and unethical, other behaviors--often referred to as questionable research practices (QRPs)--exploit the ethical shades of gray that color acceptable practice. This study aimed to measure the frequency of self-reported QRPs in a diverse, international sample of health professions education (HPE) researchers.\n\nMethodIn 2017, the authors conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional survey study. The web-based survey contained 43 QRP items that asked respondents to rate how often they had engaged in various forms of scientific misconduct. The items were adapted from two previously published surveys.\n\nResultsIn total, 590 HPE researchers took the survey. The mean age was 46 years (SD=11.6), and the majority of participants were from the United States (26.4%), Europe (23.2%), and Canada (15.3%). The three most frequently reported QRPs were adding authors to a paper who did not qualify for authorship (60.6%), citing articles that were not read (49.5%), and selectively citing papers to please editors or reviewers (49.4%). Additionally, respondents reported misrepresenting a participants words (6.7%), plagiarizing (5.5%), inappropriately modifying results (5.3%), deleting data without disclosure (3.4%), and fabricating data (2.4%). Overall, 533 (90.3%) respondents reported at least one QRP.\n\nConclusionsNotwithstanding the methodological limitations of survey research, these findings indicate that a substantial proportion of HPE researchers report a range of QRPs. In light of these results, reforms are needed to improve the credibility and integrity of the HPE research enterprise.\n\nO_QD\""Researchers should practice research responsibly.

However, theoretical models suggest that the antigenic evolution of influenza is best explained by postulating the existence of highly immunogenic epitopes of limited variability. Here we report the identification of such an epitope of limited variability in the head domain of the H1 haemagglutinin protein. We show that the epitope mediates immunity to historical influenza strains not previously seen by a cohort of young children. Furthermore, vaccinating mice with these epitope conformations can induce immunity to all the human H1N1 influenza strains that have circulated since 1918.

Determining their relative positions with respect to the folded nuclear genome could provide critical information on co-and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. However, it remains challenging to identify which parts of the nuclear genome are in proximity to nuclear speckles, due to physical separation between nuclear speckle cores and chromatin. We hypothesized that noncoding RNAs including small nuclear RNAs, 7SK and Malat1, which accumulate at the periphery of nuclear speckles (nsaRNA, nuclear speckle associated RNA), may extend to sufficient proximity to the nuclear genome. Leveraging a transcriptome-genome interaction assay (MARGI), we identified nsaRNA-interacting genomic sequences, which exhibited clustering patterns (nsaPeaks) in the genome, suggesting existence of relatively stable interaction sites for nsaRNAs in nuclear genome. Posttranscriptional pre-mRNAs, which are known to be clustered to nuclear speckles, exhibited proximity to nsaPeaks but rarely to other genomic regions. Furthermore, CDK9 proteins that localize to the vicinity of nuclear speckles produced ChIP-seq peaks that overlapped with nsaPeaks. Our combined DNA FISH and immunofluorescence analysis in 182 single cells revealed a 3-fold increase in odds for nuclear speckles to localize near an nsaPeak than its neighboring genomic sequence. These data suggest a model that nsaRNAs locate in sufficient proximity to nuclear genome and leave identifiable genomic footprints, thus revealing the parts of genome proximal to nuclear speckles.","10.1016/j.isci.2018.06.005"

For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis, the size of the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single full-text index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing such index takes about one day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices are rarely performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing while preserving fast search times.\n\nResultsTo solve the index construction and update problem we propose the DREAM (Dynamic seaRchablE pArallel coMpressed index) framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the introduction of an approximate search distributor directories via a novel use of Bloom filters. We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and use this new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases where they cannot match. This allows us to keep the databases in several indices which can be easily rebuilt if parts are updated while maintaining a fast search time.

Mytilus spp. is an ideal system to assess its importance, because these marine mussels form semi-isolated species that remain reproductively compatible over large time-scales. It includes three taxa that hybridize in the Northern Hemisphere (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus) and two taxa of uncertain ancestry in the Southern Hemisphere (M. platensis: South America and the Kerguelen Islands; and M. planulatus: Australasia). The Kerguelen mussels are of particular interest to investigate the potential role of admixture in enhancing micro-geographic structure, as they inhabit a small and isolated island in the Southern Ocean characterized by a highly heterogeneous environment, and genomic reticulation between Northern and Southern lineages has been suspected. Here, we extended a previous analysis by using targeted-sequencing data (51,878 SNPs) across the three Northern species and the Kerguelen population, coupled with a panel of 33 SNPs genotyped on 695 mussels across 35 sites in the Kerguelen Islands. The panel was enriched with ancestry-informative SNPs, i.e. SNPs that were more differentiated than the genomic average between Northern lineages, to evaluate whether reticulated evolution contributed to micro-geographic structure. We first showed that the Kerguelen population belongs to a divergent Southern lineage, most related to M. edulis mussels, that experienced secondary admixture with non-indigenous Northern species. We then demonstrated that the Kerguelen mussels were significantly differentiated over small spatial distance, and that this local genetic structure was associated with environmental variation and mostly revealed by ancestry-informative markers. Although local adaptation can explain the association with the environment we believe it more likely that environment variables better describe population connectivity than geographic distance.

Temporal predictions are modelled by the hazard function, which describes the instantaneous probability for an event to occur given it has not occurred yet. Here, we tackle the question of whether and how the human brain tracks continuous temporal hazard on a moment-to-moment basis, and how flexibly it adjusts to strictly implicit variations in the hazard function. We applied an encoding-model approach to human electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during a pitch-discrimination task, in which we implicitly manipulated temporal predictability of the target tones by varying the interval between cue and target tone (the foreperiod). Critically, temporal predictability was either solely driven by the passage of time (resulting in a monotonic hazard function), or was modulated to increase at intermediate foreperiods (resulting in a modulated hazard function with a peak at the intermediate foreperiod). Forward encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions, showing that implicit variations of temporal hazard bear tractable signatures in the human electroencephalogram. Notably, this tracking signal was reconstructed best from the supplementary motor area (SMA), underlining this areas link to cognitive processing of time. Our results underline the relevance of temporal hazard to cognitive processing, and show that the predictive accuracy of the encoding-model approach can be utilised to track abstract time-resolved stimuli.\n\nSignificance StatementExtracting temporal predictions from sensory input allows to process future input more efficiently and to prepare responses in time. In mathematical terms, temporal predictions can be described by the hazard function, modelling the probability of an event to occur over time. Here, we show that the human EEG tracks temporal hazard in an implicit foreperiod paradigm. Forward encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal-hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions that differed in their build-up of hazard over time. These neural signatures of tracking temporal hazard converge with the extant literature on temporal processing and provide new evidence that the supplementary motor area tracks hazard under strictly implicit timing conditions.","10.1523/ENEURO.0017-18.2018"

We found that healthy older adults indeed experience more tip-of-the-tongue states than young adults. Importantly, higher aerobic fitness levels decrease the probability of experiencing tip-of-the-tongue states in healthy older adults. Fitness-related differences in word finding abilities are observed over and above effects of age. This is the first demonstration of a link between aerobic fitness and language functioning in healthy older adults.","10.1038/s41598-018-24972-1"

Our simulation framework consists of medical image-driven modeling of patient anatomy including the Circle, 3D blood flow simulation through patient vasculature, embolus transport modeling using a discrete particle dynamics technique, and a sampling based approach to incorporate parametric variations. A total of 24 (four patients and six Circle anatomies including the complete Circle) models were considered, with cardiogenic emboli of varying sizes and compositions released virtually and tracked to compute distribution to the brain. The results establish that Circle anatomical variations significantly influence embolus distribution to the six major cerebral arteries. Embolus distribution to MCA territory is found to be least sensitive to the influence of anatomical variations. For varying Circle topologies, differences in flow through cervical vasculature are observed. This incoming flow is recruited differently across the communicating arteries of the Circle for varying anastomoses. Emboli interact with the routed flow, and can undergo significant traversal across the Circle arterial segments, depending upon their inertia and density ratio with respect to blood. This interaction drives the underlying biomechanics of embolus transport across the Circle, explaining how Circle anatomy influences embolism risk.","10.1007/s10439-018-2027-5"

Further work has been focused on the molecular mechanisms that dictate the successive multistate post-translational modifications (i.e. glycosylation by OST, deglycosylation by NGLY, and ubiquitination by Hrd1) of this CNC-bZIP protein and its proteolytic processing to yield multiple isoforms. Several lines of experimental evidence have demonstrated that the nascent Nrf1/TCF11 polypeptide (non-glycosylated) is transiently translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in which it becomes an inactive glycoprotein-A, and also folded in a proper topology within and around membranes. Thereafter, dynamic repositioning of the ER-resident domains in Nrf1 glycoprotein is driven by p97-fueled retrotranslocation into extra-ER compartments. Therein, glycoprotein of Nrf1 is allowed for digestion into a deglycoprotein-B and then its progressive proteolytic processing by cytosolic DDI-1/2 and proteasomes to yield distinct proteoforms (i.e. protein-C/D). The processing is accompanied by removal of a major N-terminal ~12.5-kDa polypeptide from Nrf1. Interestingly, our present study has further unraveled that coupled positive and negative feedback circuits exist between Nrf1 and its cognate target genes, including those encoding its regulators p97, Hrd1, DDI-1 and proteasomes. These key players are differentially or even oppositely involved in diverse cellular signalling responses to distinct extents of ER-derived proteotoxic and oxidative stresses induced by different concentrations of proteasomal inhibitors.","NA"

A unique approach to target and kill colon, prostate, and other epithelial-type cancer cells in the blood has been recently developed that causes circulating leukocytes to present the cancer-specific, liposome-bound Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) on their surface along with E - selectin adhesion receptors. This approach, demonstrated both in vitro with human blood and in mice, mimics the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells. The resulting liposomal TRAIL-coated leukocytes hold promise as an effective means to neutralize circulating tumor cells that enter the bloodstream with the potential to form new metastases.\n\nResultsThe computational biology study reported here examines the mechanism of this effective signal delivery, by considering the kinetics of the coupled reaction cascade, from TRAIL binding death receptor to eventual apoptosis. In this study, a collision of bound TRAIL with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is considered and compared to a prolonged exposure of CTCs to soluble TRAIL. An existing computational model of soluble TRAIL treatment was modified to represent the kinetics from a diffusion-limited 3D reference frame into a 2D collision frame with advection and adhesion to mimic the E - selectin and membrane bound TRAIL treatment. Thus, the current model recreates the new approach of targeting cancer cells within the blood. The model was found to faithfully reproduce representative observations from experiments of liposomal TRAIL treatment under shear. The model predicts apoptosis of CTCs within 2 hr when treated with membrane bound TRAIL, while apoptosis in CTCs treated with soluble TRAIL proceeds much more slowly over the course of 10 hrs, consistent with previous experiments. Given the clearance rate of soluble TRAIL in vivo, this model predicts that the soluble TRAIL method would be rendered ineffective, as found in previous experiments.\n\nConclusionThis study therefore indicates that the kinetics of the coupled reaction cascade of liposomal E - selectin and membrane bound TRAIL colliding with CTCs can explain why this new approach to target and kill cancer cells in blood is much more effective than its soluble counterpart.","10.3389/fonc.2018.00410"

Transitions between sequential cell cycle phases are tightly orchestrated to ensure precise and efficient cell cycle progression. Interrogating molecular events at these transitions is important for understanding normal and pathological cell proliferation and mechanisms that ensure genome stability. A popular fluorescent reporter system known as \""FUCCI\"" has been widely adopted for identifying cell cycle phases. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we quantitatively analyzed the dynamics of the FUCCI reporters relative to the transitions into and out of S phase. Although the original reporters reflect the E3 ubiquitin ligase activities for which they were designed, SCFSkp2 and APCCdh1, their dynamics are significantly and variably offset from actual S phase boundaries. To precisely mark these transitions, we generated and thoroughly validated a new reporter containing a PCNA-interacting protein degron whose oscillations are directly coupled to the process of DNA replication itself. We combined this reporter with the geminin-based APCCdh1 reporter to create \""PIP-FUCCI.\"" PIP degron reporter dynamics closely correlate with S phase transitions irrespective of reporter expression levels. Using PIP-FUCCI, we made the unexpected observation that the apparent timing of APCCdh1 inactivation frequently varies relative to the onset of S phase. We demonstrate that APCCdh1 inactivation is not a strict pre-requisite for S phase entry, though delayed APCCdh1 inactivation correlates with longer S phase. Our results illustrate the benefits of precise delineation of cell cycle phase boundaries for uncovering the sequences of molecular events at critical cell cycle transitions.","10.1080/15384101.2018.1547001"

Several influential hypotheses have suggested that large brains may be especially beneficial in social contexts. Group living and competition may pose unique cognitive challenges to individuals and favor the evolution of increased cognitive ability. Evidence comes from comparative studies on the link between social complexity and brain morphology, but the strength of empirical support has recently been challenged. In addition, the behavioral mechanisms that would link cognitive ability to sociality are rarely studied. Here we take an alternative approach and investigate experimentally how brain size can relate to the social competence of individuals within species, a problem that so far has remained unresolved. We use the unique guppy brain size selection line model system to evaluate whether large brains are advantageous by allowing individuals to better assess their performance in a social contest situation. Based on theoretical literature, we predict that contest duration should depend on the brain size of the loser, as it is the capitulation of the losing individual that ends the fight.\n\nResultsFirst, we show that studying the movement of competitors during contests allows for precise estimation of the dominance timeline in guppies, even when overt aggression is typically one-sided and delayed. Second, we staged contests between pairs of male that had been artificially selected for large and small relative brain size, with demonstrated differences in cognitive ability. We show that dominance was established much earlier in contests with large-brained losers, whereas the brain size of the winner had no effect. Following our prediction, large-brained individuals gave up more quickly when they were going to lose.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that large-brained individuals assess their performance in contests better and that social competence indeed can depend on brain size. Conflict resolution may therefore be an important behavioral mechanism behind macro-evolutionary patterns between sociality and brain size. Since conflict is ubiquitous among group-living animals, the possible effects of the social environment on the evolution of cognition may be more broadly applicable than previously thought.","NA"

In this report, we revealed the mechanisms underlying NDV-induced apoptosis via investigation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related unfolded protein response (UPR) in HeLa cells. We found that NDV infection induced the expression of pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP via PKR-eIF2 pathway. Knock down and exogenous expression studies showed that CHOP promoted cell apoptosis by down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and MCL-1, promotion of pro-apoptotic JNK and p38 signaling, and suppression of pro-survival AKT signaling. Meanwhile, CHOP facilitated NDV proliferation. Furthermore, virus infection activated IRE1, another ER stress sensor, thereby promoting the mRNA splicing of XBP1 and resulting in the translation of transcription factor XBP1s. XBP1s entered into cell nucleus, promoted the expression of ER chaperones and components of ER associated degradation (ERAD). Exogenous expression of XBP1s helped IBV proliferation, and silence of XBP1s reduced virus proliferation. Meanwhile, exogenous expression and knock down studies demonstrated that IRE1 activated pro-apoptotic JNK signaling, promoted apoptosis and inflammation. In conclusion, our current study demonstrates that the induction of CHOP and activation of IRE1-XBP1/JNK signaling cascades promote apoptosis and benefit NDV proliferation.\n\nIMPORTANCEIt is well known that NDV kills host animal and tumor cells by inducing cell apoptosis. Although several studies investigate the apoptotic phenomena in NDV-infected tumor cells, the molecular mechanisms underlying this oncolytic virus induced apoptosis is not well understood yet. In this study, we focus on characterization of the ER stress responses in NDV-infected tumor cells, and find that virus induces apoptosis by up-regulation or activation of several unfolded protein responses (UPR) related transcription factors and signaling: such as ATF4, CHOP and XBP1s, and pro-apoptotic kinases (IRE1, JNK, p38). Moreover, activation of these transcription factors and signaling cascades helps virus proliferation. Our study dissects the UPR induced apoptosis in NDV-infected tumor cells, and provides the evidence that UPR favors NDV proliferation.","NA"

Outstanding questions revolve around the type of algorithm that is most suited to decoding (i.e. full reconstruction, in the context of this study), especially in the presence of strong encoding non-linearities, and the possible role of pairwise correlations. We present, here, the first pixel-by-pixel reconstruction of a complex natural stimulus from 2-photon calcium imaging responses of mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We decoded the activity of approximately 100 neurons from layer 2/3 using an optimal linear estimator and an artificial neural network. We also investigated how much accuracy is lost in this decoding operation when ignoring pairwise neural correlations. We found that a simple linear estimator is sufficient to extract relevant stimulus features from the neural responses, and that it was not significantly outperformed by a non-linear decoding algorithm. The importance of pairwise correlations for reconstruction accuracy was also limited. The results of this study suggest that, conditional on the spatial and temporal limits of the recording technique, V1 neurons display linear readout properties, with low information content in the joint distribution of their activity.","NA"

Previous work by us and others has shown that codon identity exerts a powerful influence on mRNA stability. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, studies using a handful of reporter mRNAs show that optimal codons increase translation elongation rate, which in turn increase mRNA stability. However, a direct link between elongation rate and mRNA stability has not been established across the entire yeast transcriptome. In addition, there is evidence from work in higher eukaryotes that amino acid identity influences mRNA stability, raising the question as to whether the impact of translation elongation on mRNA decay is at the level of tRNA decoding, amino acid incorporation, or some combination of each. To address these questions, we performed ribosome profiling of wildtype yeast. In good agreement with other studies, our data showed faster codon-specific elongation over optimal codons and faster transcript-level elongation correlating with transcript optimality. At both the codon-level and transcript-level, faster elongation correlated with increased mRNA stability. These findings were reinforced by showing increased translation efficiency and kinetics for a panel of 11 HIS3 reporter mRNAs of increasing codon optimality. While we did observe that elongation measured by ribosome profiling is composed of both amino acid identity and synonymous codon effects, further analyses of these data establish that A-site tRNA decoding rather than other steps of translation elongation is driving mRNA decay in yeast.","10.1261/rna.066787.118"

However, anti-angiogenic therapy has not proved to be effective in reducing tumor growth across a wide range of tumors, and no reliable predictive biomarkers have been found to determine the efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatment. Using our previously established computational model of tumor-bearing mice, we sought to determine whether tumor growth kinetic parameters could be used to predict the outcome of anti-angiogenic treatment. A model trained with datasets from six in vivo mice studies was used to generate a randomized in silico tumor-bearing mouse population. We analyzed tumor growth in untreated mice (control) and mice treated with an anti-angiogenic agent and determined the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates based on simulated tumor volume data. We found that the ratio between two kinetic parameters, k0 and k1, which characterize the tumors exponential and linear growth rates, as well as k1 alone, can be used as prognostic biomarkers of population survival outcome.

RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samples the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody to an antigen in highly customizable protocols for the design of antibodies in a broad range of applications. The program samples antibody sequences and structures by grafting structures from a widely accepted set of the canonical clusters of CDRs (North et al., J. Mol. Biol., 406:228-256, 2011). It then performs sequence design according to amino acid sequence profiles of each cluster, and samples CDR backbones using a flexible-backbone design protocol incorporating cluster-based CDR constraints. Starting from an existing experimental or computationally modeled antigen-antibody structure, RAbD can be used to redesign a single CDR or multiple CDRs with loops of different length, conformation, and sequence. We rigorously benchmarked RAbD on a set of 60 diverse antibody-antigen complexes, using two design strategies - optimizing total Rosetta energy and optimizing interface energy alone. We utilized two novel metrics for measuring success in computational protein design. The design risk ratio (DRR) is equal to the frequency of recovery of native CDR lengths and clusters divided by the frequency of sampling of those features during the Monte Carlo design procedure. Ratios greater than 1.0 indicate that the design process is picking out the native more frequently than expected from their sampled rate. We achieved DRRs for the non-H3 CDRs of between 2.4 and 4.0. The antigen risk ratio (ARR) is the ratio of frequencies of the native amino acid types, CDR lengths, and clusters in the output decoys for simulations performed in the presence and absence of the antigen. For CDRs, we achieved cluster ARRs as high as 2.5 for L1 and 1.5 for H2. For sequence design simulations without CDR grafting, the overall recovery for the native amino acid types for residues that contact the antigen in the native structures was 72% in simulations performed in the presence of the antigen and 48% in simulations performed without the antigen, for an ARR of 1.5. For the non-contacting residues, the ARR was 1.08. This shows that the sequence profiles are able to maintain the amino acid types of these conserved, buried sites, while recovery of the exposed, contacting residues requires the presence of the antigen-antibody interface. We tested RAbD experimentally on both a lambda and kappa antibody-antigen complex, successfully improving their affinities 10 to 50 fold by replacing individual CDRs of the native antibody with new CDR lengths and clusters.\n\nAuthor SummaryAntibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to attack infections and cancer and are also used as drugs to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. The mechanism that has evolved to produce them is able to make 10s of millions of different antibodies, each with a different surface used to bind the foreign or mutated molecule. We have developed a method to design antibodies computationally, based on the 1000s of experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of antibodies available. The method works by treating pieces of these structures as a collection of parts that can be combined in new ways to make better antibodies. Our method has been implemented in the protein modeling program Rosetta, and is called RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD). We tested RAbD both computationally and experimentally. The experimental test shows that we can improve existing antibodies by 10 to 50 fold, paving the way for design of entirely new antibodies in the future.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006112"

The search for a biochemical mechanism of catalysis of W42Q aggregation by WT has revealed that WT H{gamma}D can transfer a disulfide bond to the W42Q variant. The transferred disulfide kinetically traps an aggregation-prone intermediate made accessible by the W42Q mutation, facilitating light-scattering aggregation of the W42Q variant. The aggregating variant thus becomes a disulfide sink, removing the disulfides from solution. Such redox \""hot potato\"" competitions among wild-type and mutant or modified polypeptides may be relevant for many long-lived proteins that function in oxidizing environments.

In typical experiments, fluorescence from the entire three-dimensional (3D) cell body is projected along the z-axis of the microscope to form a 2D image at the camera plane. For imaging of two different species, here denoted \""red\"" and \""green\"", a significant biological question is the extent to which the red and green spatial distributions are positively correlated, anti-correlated, or uncorrelated. A commonly used statistic for assessing the degree of linear correlation between two image matrices R and G is the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). PCC should vary from -1 (perfect anti-correlation) to 0 (no linear correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation). However, in the special case of spherocylindrical bacterial cells such as E. coli or B. subtilis, we show that the PCC fails both qualitatively and quantitatively. PCC returns the same +1 value for 2D projections of distributions that are either perfectly correlated in 3D or completely uncorrelated in 3D. The PCC also systematically underestimates the degree of anti-correlation between the projections of two perfectly anti-correlated 3D distributions. The problem is that the projection of a random spatial distribution within the 3D spherocylinder is non-random in 2D, whereas PCC compares every matrix element of R or G with the constant mean value[Formula] or[Formula] . We propose a modified Pearson Correlation Coefficient (MPCC) that corrects this problem for spherocylindrical cell geometry by using the proper reference matrix for comparison with R and G. Correct behavior of MPCC is confirmed for a variety of numerical simulations and on experimental distributions of HU and RNA polymerase in live E. coli cells. The MPCC concept should be generalizable to other cell shapes.","10.1186/s12859-018-2444-3"

The decaytime of the electrically evoked event doubled in NNC 711 and this increase was reversed by subsequent application of {omega}-conotoxin GVIA, suggesting that the source of GABA responding to NNC 711 originate from axons that terminate on pyramidal neuron dendrites and employ N-type Ca-channels for release.","NA"

Hence, cell size needs to be kept within certain limits and relatively constant over multiple generations. However, how cells measure their size and use this information to regulate growth and division remains controversial. Here, we present two mechanistic mathematical models of the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) cell cycle to investigate competing hypotheses on size control: inhibitor dilution and titration of nuclear sites. Our results suggest that an inhibitor-dilution mechanism, in which cell growth dilutes the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5 against the constant activator Cln3, can facilitate size homeostasis. This is achieved by utilising a positive feedback loop to establish a fixed size threshold for the SO_SCPCAPTARTC_SCPCAP transition, which efficiently couples cell growth to cell cycle progression. Yet, we show that inhibitor dilution cannot reproduce the size of mutants that alter the cells overall ploidy and WHI5 gene copy number. By contrast, size control through titration of Cln3 against a constant number of genomic binding sites for the transcription factor SBF recapitulates both size homeostasis and the size of these mutant strains. Moreover, this model produces an imperfect  sizer behaviour in G1 and a  timer in S/G2/M, which combine to yield an  adder over the whole cell cycle; an observation recently made in experiments. Hence, our model connects these phenomenological data with the molecular details of the cell cycle, providing a systems-level perspective of budding yeast size control.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006548"

We evidence that ezrin (ezrinWT) and its phosphomimetic mutant T567D (ezrinTD) do not deform membranes but self-assemble anti-parallelly, zipping adjacent membranes. EzrinTDs specific conformation reduces intermolecular ezrin interactions, allows binding to actin filaments, and promotes ezrin binding to positively curved membranes. While neither ezrinTD nor ezrinWT senses negative membrane curvature alone, we demonstrate that interacting with curvature sensors I-BAR-domain proteins facilitates ezrin enrichment in negatively curved membrane protrusions.

Furthermore, nucleated hematopoietic cells contain circRNA that have higher expression levels than the corresponding linear RNA. Enucleated blood cells, i.e. platelets and erythrocytes, were suggested to use RNA to maintain their function, respond to environmental factors or to transmit signals to other cells via microvesicles.

Currently available Afg3l2 mutant mice harbour deletions that lead to severe, early-onset neurological phenotypes that do not faithfully reproduce the late-onset and slowly progressing SCA28 phenotype. Here we describe production and detailed analysis of a new knock-in murine model harbouring an Afg3l2 allele carrying the p.Met665Arg patient-derived mutation. Heterozygous mutant mice developed normally but signs of ataxia were detectable by beam test at 18 months. Cerebellar pathology was negative; electrophysiological analysis showed increased spontaneous firing in Purkinje cells from heterozygous mutants with respect to wild-type controls, although not statistically significant. As homozygous mutants died perinatally with evidence of cardiac atrophy, for each genotype we generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to investigate mitochondrial function. MEFs from mutant mice showed altered mitochondrial bioenergetics, with decreased basal oxygen consumption rate, ATP synthesis and mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondrial network formation and morphology was also altered, in line with greatly reduced expression of Opa1 fusogenic protein L-isoforms. The mitochondrial alterations observed in MEFs were also detected in cerebella of 18-month-old heterozygous mutants, suggesting they may be a hallmark of disease.

Affinity purification and mass spectrometry identified the v-SNARE VAMP3 as an interaction partner of WDFY2, and cellular knockout of WDFY2 caused a strong redistribution of VAMP3 into small vesicles near the plasma membrane. This was accompanied by increased secretion of the matrix metalloprotease MT1-MMP, enhanced degradation of extracellular matrix, and increased cell invasion.

Unfortunately, immunity programs may also cause unintended collateral damage to the plant itself. The quantitative disease resistance gene ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6) serves as a nexus for the trade-off between growth and pathogen resistance in wild populations of Arabidopsis thaliana. An autoimmune allele, ACD6-Est, first identified in the natural accession Est-1, is found in over 10% of wild strains, even though it causes a clear fitness penalty under optimal growth conditions. There is, however, extensive variation in the strength of the autoimmune phenotype expressed by strains with an ACD6-Est allele, indicative of genetic modifiers. Quantitative genetic analysis suggests that the population genetic basis of ACD6 modulation is complex, with different strains often carrying different large-effect modifiers. One modifier is SUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1, CONSTITUTIVE 1 (SNC1), located in a highly polymorphic cluster of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptor genes, which are prototypes for qualitative disease resistance genes. Allelic variation at SNC1 correlates with ACD6-Est activity in multiple accessions, and a common structural variant affecting the NL linker sequence can explain differences in SNC1 activity. Taken together, we find that an NLR gene can mask the activity of an ACD6 autoimmune allele in natural A. thaliana populations, thereby linking different arms of the plant immune system.\n\nAuthor summaryPlants defend themselves against pathogens by activating immune responses. Unfortunately, these can cause unintended collateral damage to the plant itself. Nevertheless, some wild plants have genetic variants that confer a low threshold for the activation of immunity. While these enable a plant to respond particularly quickly to pathogen attack, such variants might be potentially dangerous. We are investigating one such variant of the immune gene ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6) in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We discovered that there are variants at other genetic loci that can mask the effects of an overly active ACD6 gene. One of these genes, SUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1, CONSTITUTIVE 1 (SNC1), codes for a known immune receptor. The SNC1 variant that attenuates ACD6 activity is rather common in A. thaliana populations, suggesting that new combinations of the hyperactive ACD6 variant and this antagonistic SNC1 variant will often arise by natural crosses. Similarly, because the two genes are unlinked, outcrossing will often lead to the hyperactive ACD6 variants being unmasked again. We propose that allelic diversity at SNC1 contributes to the maintenance of the hyperactive ACD6 variant in natural A. thaliana populations.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007628"

Here, we use whole exome sequencing to assess the prevalence of rare, potentially deleterious variants in candidate genes previously associated with both syndromic and non-syndromic TOF, in the largest cohort of non-syndromic TOF patients reported to date.\n\nMethods & Results829 non-syndromic TOF patients underwent whole exome sequencing. A systematic review of the literature was conducted which revealed 77 genes in which mutations had been reported in patients with TOF. The presence of rare, deleterious variants in the 77 candidate genes was determined, defined by a minor allele frequency of [&le;] 0.001 and scaled combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) score of [&ge;] 20. We found a clustering of heterozygous rare, deleterious variants in NOTCH1 (P=1.89E-15), DOCK6 (P=2.93E-07), MYOM2 (P= 7.35E-05), TTC37 (P=0.016), MESP1 (P=0.024) and TBX1 (P=0.039), after correcting for multiple testing. NOTCH1 was most frequently found to harbour deleterious variants. Changes were observed in 49 patients (6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.5% - 7.8%) and included six truncating/frameshift variants and forty missense variants. Sanger sequencing of the unaffected parents of thirteen cases identified five de novo variants. Variants were not confined to a single functional domain of the NOTCH1 protein but significant clustering of variants was evident in the EGF-like repeats (P=0.018). Three NOTCH1 missense variants (p.G200R, p.C607Y and de novo p.N1875S) were subjected to functional evaluation and showed a reduction in Jagged1 ligand-induced NOTCH signalling. p.C607Y, which exhibited the most significant reduction in signalling, also perturbed S1 cleavage of the NOTCH1 receptor in the Golgi.\n\nConclusionThe NOTCH1 locus is a frequent site of genetic variants predisposing to non-syndromic TOF with 6% of patients exhibiting rare, deleterious variants.

We tested constructs containing a single hairpin, based on the binding sites of the coat RBPs of bacteriophages GA, MS2, PP7, and Q{beta}, positioned in the 5 UTR of a reporter gene. With specifically-bound RBP present, either weak repression or up-regulation is observed, depending on the binding site and its flanking sequence. SHAPE-Seq data for a representative construct exhibiting up-regulation, indicates a partially-folded hairpin and non-reactive upstream and downstream flanking region, which we attribute to intermediate structures that apparently blocks translation. RBP binding stabilizes the fully-folded hairpin state and thus facilitates translation, suggesting that the up-regulating constructs are RBP-sensing riboswitches. This finding is further supported by lengthening the binding-site stem, which in turn destabilizes the translationally-inactive state, and abolishes the up-regulating behavior. Finally, we found that the combination of two binding sites, positioned in the 5 UTR and gene-header of the same transcript, can yield a cooperative regulatory response. Together, we show that the interaction of an RBP with its RNA target facilitates structural changes in the RNA, which is reflected by a controllable range of binding affinities and dose response behaviors. Thus, demonstrating that RNA-RBP interactions can provide a platform for constructing gene regulatory networks that are based on translational, rather than transcriptional, regulation.","NA"

In the absence of RNA-binding proteins, the translation level depends on hairpin location, and exhibits a three-nucleotide periodicity. For hairpin positions within the initiation region, we observe strong translational repression in the presence of its cognate RNA-binding protein. In vivo SHAPE-seq results for a representative construct indicate that the repression phenomenon correlates with a wide-swath of protection, including the hairpin and extending past the ribosome binding site. Consequently, our data suggest that the protection provided by the RBP-hairpin complex inhibits ribosomal initiation. Finally, utilizing the repression phenomenon for quantifying protein-RNA binding affinity in vivo, we both observe partially contrasting results to previous in vitro and in situ studies, and additionally, show that this method can be used in a high-throughput assay for a quantitative study of protein-RNA binding in vivo.","10.1021/acssynbio.8b00378"

While delivering complementary information, there are still distinct differences between these techniques, most prominently the use of fluorescent dye-tagged probes for STED-FCS and a need for larger scattering gold nanoparticle tags for iSCAT. In this work we have used lipid analogues tagged with a hybrid fluorescent tag - gold nanoparticle construct, to directly compare the results from STED-FCS and iSCAT measurements of phospholipid diffusion on a homogeneous Supported Lipid Bilayer (SLB). These comparative measurements showed that while the mode of diffusion remained free, at least at the spatial (>40 nm) and temporal (50 [&le;] t [&le;] 100 ms) scales probed, the diffussion coefficient was reduced by 20- to 60-fold when tagging with 20 and 40 nm large gold particles as compared to when using dye-tagged lipid analogues. These FCS measurements of hybrid fluorescent tag - gold nanoparticle labeled lipids also revealed that commercially supplied streptavidin-coated gold nanoparticles contain large quantities of free streptavidin. Finally, the values of apparent diffusion coefficients obtained by STED-FCS and iSCAT differed by a factor of 2-3 across the techniques, while relative differences in mobility between different species of lipid analogues considered were identical in both approaches. In conclusion, our experiments reveal that large and potentially crosslinking scattering tags introduce a significant slow-down in diffusion on SLBs but no additional bias, and our labeling approach creates a new way of exploiting complementary information from STED-FCS and iSCAT measurements.","10.1088/1361-6463/aac04f"

However, theoretical models suggest that the antigenic evolution of influenza is best explained by postulating the existence of highly immunogenic epitopes of limited variability. Here we report the identification of such an epitope of limited variability in the head domain of the H1 haemagglutinin protein.

Furthermore, vaccinating mice with these epitope conformations can induce immunity to all the human H1N1 influenza strains that have circulated since 1918.

In differential alternative splicing, the relative abundance of transcript variants differs across sample types. Differential alternative splicing is common in animal systems and influences cellular development in many processes, but its extent and significance is not as well known in plants. To investigate alternative splicing in plants, we examined rice seedling RNA-Seq data that included approximately 40 million sequence alignments per library, three libraries per sample type, and four sample types: roots and shoots, each treated with exogenous cytokinin delivered hydroponically, plus mock-treated controls. Cytokinin treatment triggered expression changes in thousands of genes, but had minimal effect on alternative splicing. However, there were many splicing differences between roots and shoots. Analysis of a similar (but less deeply sequenced) mRNA-Seq data set from Arabidopsis showed the same pattern. Quantitative fragment analysis of reverse transcriptase-PCR products made from newly prepared rice samples confirmed nine of ten differential splicing events between rice roots and shoots. In both the Arabidopsis and rice mRNA-Seq data sets, most genes annotated as alternatively spliced had small minor variant frequencies, i.e., the less frequently observed forms were supported by fewer than 20% of informative mRNA-Seq sequences. Of splicing choices where there was more abundant support for minor forms, most alternative splicing events were located within the protein-coding sequence and also maintained the annotated reading frame. A tool for visualizing protein annotations in the context of genomic sequence (ProtAnnot) together with a genome browser (Integrated Genome Browser) were used to visualize and assess effects of differential splicing on gene function. In general, differentially spliced regions coincided with conserved regions in the encoded proteins, indicating that differential alternative splicing is likely to affect protein function between root and shoot tissue in rice.","10.1002/pld3.136"

It is currently unclear to what extent these hallmarks associate with symptoms of disease at extreme ages. Forty centenarians from the 100-plus Study cohort agreed to post-mortem brain donation. Centenarians self-reported to be cognitive healthy at baseline, which was confirmed by a proxy. Objective ante-mortem measurements of cognitive performance were associated with the prevalence, distribution and quantity of age- and AD-related neuropathological hallmarks. Despite self-reported cognitive health, objective neuropsychological testing suggested varying levels of ante-mortem cognitive functioning. Post-mortem, we found that most neuropathological hallmarks related to age and neurodegenerative diseases such as A{beta} and Tau pathology, as well as atherosclerosis, were abundantly present in most or all centenarians, whereas Lewy body and pTDP-43 pathology were scarce. We observed that increased pathology loads correlated across pathology subtypes, and an overall trend of higher pathology loads to associate with a lower cognitive test performance. This trend was carried especially by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) and to a lesser extent by A{beta}-associated pathologies. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) specifically associated with lower executive functioning in the centenarians. In conclusion, we find that while the centenarians in this cohort escaped or delayed cognitive impairment until extreme ages, their brains reveal varying levels of disease-associated neuropathological hallmarks, some of which associate with cognitive performance.","10.1186/s40478-018-0558-5"

Adherent cells apply contractile forces to the material on which they adhere, and sense the resistance of the material to deformation - its stiffness. This is dependent on both the elastic modulus and the thickness of the material, with the corollary that single cells are able to sense underlying stiff materials through soft hydrogel materials at low (<10 {micro}m) thicknesses. Here, we hypothesised that cohesive colonies of cells exert more force and create more hydrogel deformation than single cells, therefore enabling them to mechanosense more deeply into underlying materials than single cells. To test this, we modulated the thickness of soft (1 kPa) elastic ECM-functionalised polyacrylamide hydrogels adhered to glass substrates and allowed colonies of MG63 cells to form on their surfaces. Cell morphology and deformations of fluorescent fiducial-marker labelled hydrogels were quantified by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy imaging. Single cell spreading increased with respect to decreasing hydrogel thickness, with data fitting to an exponential model with half-maximal response at a thickness of 3.2 m. By quantifying cell area within colonies of defined area, we similarly found that colony-cell spreading increased with decreasing hydrogel thickness but with a greater halfmaximal response at 54 m. Depth-sensing was dependent on ROCK-mediated cellular  contractility. Surface hydrogel deformations were significantly greater on thick hydrogels compared to thin hydrogels. In addition, deformations extended greater distances from the periphery of colonies on thick hydrogels compared to thin hydrogels. Our data suggest that by acting collectively, cells mechanosense rigid materials beneath elastic hydrogels at greater depths than individual cells. This raises the possibility that the collective action of cells in colonies or sheets may allow cells to sense structures of differing material properties at comparatively large distances.","NA"

Here we use transgenic and cytological approaches to demonstrate that cifA independently rescues CI and nullifies embryonic death caused by wMel Wolbachia in Drosophila melanogaster. Discovery of cifA as the rescue gene and previously one of two CI induction genes establishes a new  Two-by-One model that underpins the genetic basis of CI. Results highlight the central role of prophage WO in shaping Wolbachia phenotypes that are significant to arthropod evolution and vector control.\n\nSignificance StatementThe World Health Organization recommended pilot deployment of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to curb viral transmission to humans. Releases of mosquitoes are underway worldwide because Wolbachia can block replication of these pathogenic viruses and deterministically spread by a drive system termed cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). Despite extensive research, the underlying genetic basis of CI remains only half-solved. We recently reported that two prophage WO genes recapitulate the modification component of CI in a released strain for vector control. Here we show that one of these genes underpins rescue of CI. Together, our results reveal the complete genetic basis of this selfish trait and pave the way for future studies exploring WO prophage genes as adjuncts or alternatives to current control efforts.","10.1073/pnas.1800650115"

Bidirectional indices have opened new possibilities in this regard allowing the search to start from anywhere within the pattern and extend in both directions. In particular, use of search schemes (partitioning the pattern and searching the pieces in certain orders with given bounds on errors) can yield significant speed-ups. However, finding optimal search schemes is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem.\n\nHere for the first time, we propose a mixed integer program (MIP) capable to solve this optimization problem for Hamming distance with given number of pieces. Our experiments show that the optimal search schemes found by our MIP significantly improve the performance of search in bidirectional FM-index upon previous ad-hoc solutions. For example, approximate matching of 101-bp Illumina reads (with two errors) becomes 35 times faster than standard backtracking. Moreover, despite being performed purely in the index, the running time of search using our optimal schemes (for up to two errors) is comparable to the best state-of-the-art aligners, which benefit from combining search in index with in-text verification using dynamic programming. As a result, we anticipate a full-fledged aligner that employs an intelligent combination of search in the bidirectional FM-index using our optimal search schemes and in-text verification using dynamic programming that will outperform todays best aligners. The development of such an aligner, called FAMOUS (Fast Approximate string Matching using OptimUm search Schemes), is ongoing as our future work.","NA"

Although several algorithms for analysing multi-omic data exist, no study has yet performed a detailed comparison of these methods in biologically relevant contexts. Here we benchmark a novel tensorial independent component analysis (tICA) algorithm against current state-of-the-art methods. Using simulated and real multi-omic data, we find that tICA outperforms established methods in identifying biological sources of data variation at a significantly reduced computational cost. Using two independent multi cell-type EWAS, we further demonstrate how tICA can identify, in the absence of genotype information, mQTLs at a higher sensitivity than competing multi-way algorithms. We validate mQTLs found with tICA in an independent set, and demonstrate that approximately 75% of mQTLs are independent of blood cell subtype. In an application to multi-omic cancer data, tICA identifies many gene modules whose expression variation across tumors is driven by copy number or DNA methylation changes, but whose deregulation relative to the normal state is independent such alterations, an important finding that we confirm by direct analysis of individual data types. In summary, tICA is a powerful novel algorithm for decomposing multi-omic data, which will be of great value to the research community.","10.1186/s13059-018-1455-8"

Ostrom stressed that there are no panaceas or universal solutions to environmental problems, and developed a social-ecological systems (SES) framework -a nested multi-tier set of variables- to help diagnose problems, identify complex interactions, and solutions tailored to each SES arena. The framework has been applied to over a hundred cases, typically reflecting in-depth analysis of local case studies, but with relatively small coverage in space and time. While case studies are context rich and necessary, it can be difficult to upscale their lessons to policy making realms. Here we develop a data driven method for upscaling Ostroms SES framework and apply it to a context where data is scarce, incomplete, but also where sustainable solutions are needed. The purpose of upscaling the framework is to create a tool that facilitates decision-making on data scarce contexts such as developing countries. We mapped SES by applying the SES framework to poverty alleviation and food security issues in the Volta River basin in Ghana and Burkina Faso. We found archetypical configurations of SES in space. Given data availability, we study their change over time, and discuss where agricultural innovations such as water reservoirs might have a stronger impact at increasing food security and therefore alleviating poverty and hunger. We conclude by outlining how the method can be used in other SES comparative studies.","10.1088/1748-9326/ab666e"

The pygmy phenotype (small adult body size), a characteristic of hunter-gatherer populations inhabiting both African and Asian tropical rainforests, is often highlighted as another case of convergent adaptation in humans. However, the degree to which phenotypic convergence in this polygenic trait is due to convergent vs. population-specific genetic changes is unknown. To address this question, we analyzed high-coverage sequence data from the protein-coding portion of the genomes (exomes) of two pairs of populations, Batwa rainforest hunter-gatherers and neighboring Bakiga agriculturalists from Uganda, and Andamanese rainforest hunter-gatherers (Jarawa and Onge) and Brahmin agriculturalists from India. We observed signatures of convergent positive selection between the Batwa and Andamanese rainforest hunter-gatherers across the set of genes with annotated  growth factor binding functions (p < 0.001). Unexpectedly, for the rainforest groups we also observed convergent and population-specific signatures of positive selection in pathways related to cardiac development (e.g.  cardiac muscle tissue development; p = 0.001). We hypothesize that the growth hormone sub-responsiveness likely underlying the pygmy phenotype may have led to compensatory changes in cardiac pathways, in which this hormone also plays an essential role. Importantly, in the agriculturalist populations we did not observe similar patterns of positive selection on sets of genes associated with either growth or cardiac development, indicating that our results most likely reflect a history of convergent adaptation to the similar ecology of rainforest hunter-gatherers rather than a more common or general evolutionary pattern for human populations.","NA"

This entails standardized procedures for sample collection, processing, freezing and storage. The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) partnered with local institutions to establish Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP)-accredited laboratories to support clinical trials in Africa, Europe and Asia. Here we report on the performance of seven laboratories based in Africa and Europe in the interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN-{gamma} ELISpot) assay and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) processing over four years. Characterized frozen PBMC samples from 48 volunteer blood packs processed at a central laboratory were sent to participating laboratories. For each stimulus, there were 1751 assays performed over four years. 98% of these ELISpot data were within acceptable ranges with low responses to mock stimuli. There were no significant differences in ELISpot responses at five laboratories actively conducting immunological analyses in support of IAVI sponsored clinical trials or HIV research. In a separate study, 1,297 PBMC samples isolated from healthy HIV-1 negative participants in clinical trials of two prophylactic HIV vaccine candidates were analysed for PBMC yield from fresh blood and cell recovery and viability following freezing and thawing. 94 % and 96 % of samples had fresh PBMC viabilities and cell yields within the pre-defined acceptance criteria while for frozen PBMC, 99 % and 96 % of samples had acceptable viabilities and cell recoveries respectively, along with acceptable ELISpot responses in 95%.

Here, we found that macrophage exosomes depend on T cell immunoglobulin and mucin receptor 1 (TIM-1), a hepatitis A virus (HAV) receptor, to enter hepatocytes for delivering IFN--induced anti-HBV activity. Moreover, two primary endocytic routes for virus infection, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and macropinocytosis, collaborate to permit exosome entry and anti-HBV activity transfer. Subsequently, lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), an anionic lipid closely related to endosome penetration of virus, facilitates membrane fusion of exosomes in late endosomes/ multivesicular bodies (LEs/MVBs) and the accompanying exosomal cargo uncoating. Together, this study provides comprehensive insights into the transmission route of macrophage exosomes to efficiently deliver IFN--induced anti-HBV activity and highlights the similarities between the entry mechanisms of exosomes and virus.\n\nImportanceOur previous study showed that LNPC-derived exosomes could transmit IFN--induced antiviral activity to HBV replicating hepatocytes, but the concrete transmission mechanisms which include exosome entry and exosomal cargo release remain unclear. In this study, we found that virus entry machinery and pathway were also applied to exosome-mediated cell-to-cell antiviral activity transfer. Macrophage-derived exosomes exploit hepatitis A virus receptor for access to hepatocytes. Later, CME and macropinocytosis are utilized by exosomes which is followed by exosome-endosome fusion for efficient transfer of IFN--induced anti-HBV activity.

This is due to the delay in diagnosis and lack of effective monitoring tools. To overcome this drawback, serum beta-D-glucan (BG) and P. insidiosum specific antibody (Pi-Ab) were examined as potential monitoring markers in vascular pythiosis.\n\nMethodsA prospective cohort study of vascular pythiosis patients was carried on during January 2010-July 2016. Clinical information and blood samples were collected and evaluated by the BG and Pi-Ab assays. Linear mixed effect models were used to compare BG and Pi-Ab levels. The in vitro susceptibility test was performed in all P. insidiosum isolates from culture positive cases.\n\nResultsA total of 50 patients were enrolled; 45 survived and 5 died during follow-up. The survivors had a significantly shorter time to medical care (p<0.0001) and a significantly shorter waiting time to the first surgery (p<0.0001). There were no differences in BG levels among the groups at diagnosis (p=0.17); however, BG levels among survivors were significantly lower than the deceased group at 0.5 months (p<0.0001) and became undetectable after 3 months. Survivors were able to maintain ELISA value (EV) of Pi-Ab above 8, whereas EV among deceased patients was less than 4. In vitro susceptibility results revealed no synergistic effects between itraconazole and terbinafine.\n\nConclusionsThis study showed that BG and Pi-Ab were potentially valuable markers to monitor the disease after treatment initiation. An unchanged BG level at 2 weeks after surgery should prompt an evaluation for residual disease.","10.1128/JCM.00610-18"

Biofilms were formed with bacterial (seven different species including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, VRE) or fungal (C. albicans) species on catheter materials. Biofilm formation was evaluated by quantitative culture (colony forming units, CFUs) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Treatment with ACL inhibited growth of adhesion phase biofilms in vitro after 60 min (VRE) or 15 min (all others), while mature biofilms were eradicated after exposure for 2 or 4 h, compared to control. Similar results were observed for drug-resistant bacteria. In the catheterized rabbit model, when compared against heparinized saline control, ACL lock therapy significantly reduced the catheter bacterial (3.49 {+/-} 0.75 vs. 0.03 {+/-} 0.06 log CFU/catheter, respectively; P = 0.001) and fungal burden (2.48 {+/-} 1.60 vs. 0.55 {+/-} 1.19 log CFU/catheter segment, respectively; P = 0.012).

A.","Robert A Burne","University of Florida","2018-04-13",1,"15","new results","microbiology","Bacteria prioritize sugar metabolism via carbohydrate catabolite repression, which regulates global gene expression to optimize the catabolism of preferred substrates. Here, we report an unusual long-term memory effect in certain Streptococcus mutans strains that alters adaptation to growth on lactose after prior exposure to glucose or fructose. In strain GS-5, cells that were first cultured on fructose then transferred to lactose displayed an exceptionally long lag (>11 h) and slower growth, compared to cells first cultured on glucose or cellobiose, which displayed a reduction in lag phase by as much as 10 h. Mutants lacking the cellobiose-PTS or phospho-{beta}-glucosidase lost the accelerated growth on lactose associated with prior culturing on glucose. The memory effects of glucose or fructose on lactose catabolism were not as profound in strain UA159, but the lag phase was considerably shorter in mutants lacking the glucose-PTS EIIMan. Interestingly, when S. mutans was cultivated on lactose, significant quantities of free glucose accumulated in the medium, with higher levels found in the cultures of strains lacking EIIMan, glucokinase, or both. Free glucose was also detected in cultures that were utilizing cellobiose or trehalose, albeit at lower levels. Such release of hexoses by S. mutans is likely of biological significance as it was found that cells required small amounts of glucose or other preferred carbohydrates to initiate efficient growth on lactose. These findings suggest that S. mutans modulates the induction of lactose utilization based on its prior exposure to glucose or fructose, which can be liberated from common disaccharides.\n\nIMPORTANCEUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms employed by oral bacteria to control sugar metabolism is key to developing novel therapies for management of dental caries and other oral diseases. Lactose is a naturally occurring disaccharide that is abundant in dairy products and commonly ingested by humans. However, for the dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of genes required for lactose uptake and catabolism. Two peculiarities of lactose utilization by S. mutans are explored here: a) S. mutans excretes glucose that it cleaves from lactose and b) prior exposure to certain carbohydrates can result in a long-term inability to use lactose. The study begins to shed light on how S. mutans may bet-hedge to optimize its persistence and virulence in the human oral cavity.","10.1128/aem.00864-18"

On ingestion, rapid responses within the gustatory system are required to identify the oral stimulus to guide immediate behaviour (swallowing or expulsion). The way in which the human brain accomplishes this task has so far remained unclear. Using multivariate analysis of 64-channel scalp EEG recordings obtained from 16 volunteers during tasting salty, sweet, sour, or bitter solutions, we found that activity in the delta-frequency range (1-4 Hz; delta power and phase) has information about taste identity in the human brain, with discriminable response patterns at the single-trial level within 130 ms of tasting. Importantly, the latencies of these response patterns predicted the point in time at which participants indicated detection of a taste by pressing a button. Furthermore, taste pattern discrimination was independent of motor-related activation and other taste features such as intensity and valence. On comparison with our previous findings from a passive (delayed) taste-discrimination task (Crouzet et al., 2015), taste-specific neural representations emerged earlier during this active (speeded) taste-detection task, suggesting a goal-dependent flexibility in gustatory response coding. Together, these findings provide the first evidence of a role of delta activity in taste-information coding in humans. Crucially, these neuronal response patterns can be linked to the speed of simple gustatory perceptual decisions - a vital performance index of nutrient sensing.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.07.034"

By carrying out over 1 million pairwise growth simulations for 14 microbial species in a combinatorial assortment of environmental conditions, we find that there is indeed a large space of metabolites that can be secreted at no cost, which can generate ample cross-feeding opportunities. In addition to providing an atlas of putative costless interdependencies, our modeling also demonstrates that oxygen availability significantly enhances mutualistic interactions by providing more opportunities for metabolic exchange through costless metabolites, resulting in an over-representation of specific ecological network motifs. In addition to helping explain natural diversity, we show how the exchange of costless metabolites can facilitate the engineering of stable synthetic microbial consortia.","10.1038/s41467-018-07946-9"

Mark-recapture methods require the identification of individuals; however, for many species and sampling methods, particularly noninvasive methods, no individuals or only a subset of individuals are individually identifiable. The unmarked SCR model, theoretically, can estimate the density of unmarked populations; however, it produces biased and imprecise density estimates in many sampling scenarios typically encountered. Spatial mark-resight (SMR) models extend the unmarked SCR model in three ways: 1) by introducing a subset of individuals that are marked and individually identifiable, 2) introducing the possibility of individual-linked telemetry data, and 3) introducing the possibility that the capture-recapture data from the survey used to deploy the marks can be used in a joint model, all improving the reliability of density estimates. The categorical spatial partial identity model (SPIM) improves the reliability of density estimates over unmarked SCR along another dimension, by adding categorical identity covariates that improve the probabilistic association of the latent identity samples. Here, we combine these two models into a \""categorical SMR\"" model to exploit the benefits of both models simultaneously. We demonstrate using simulations that SMR alone can produce biased and imprecise density estimates with sparse data and/or when few individuals are marked. Then, using a fisher (Pekania pennanti) genetic capture-recapture data set, we show how categorical identity covariates, marked individuals, telemetry data, and jointly modeling the capture survey used to deploy marks with the resighting survey all combine to improve inference over the unmarked SCR model. As previously seen in an application of the categorical SPIM to a real-world data set, the fisher data set demonstrates that individual heterogeneity in detection function parameters, especially the spatial scale parameter{sigma} , introduces positive bias into latent identity SCR models (e.g., unmarked SCR, SMR), but the categorical SMR model provides more tools to reduce this positive bias than SMR or the categorical SPIM alone. We introduce the possibility of detection functions that vary by identity category level, which will remove individual heterogeneity in detection function parameters than is explained by categorical covariates, such as individual sex. Finally, we provide efficient SMR algorithms that accommodate all SMR sample types, interspersed marking and sighting periods, and any number of identity covariates using the 2-dimensional individual by trap data in conjunction with precomputed constraint matrices, rather than the 3-dimensional individual by trap by occasion data used in SMR algorithms to date.","NA"

Furthermore, this coding persisted both during a delay period, after the rat made a decision and was waiting for an outcome, and after the outcome was revealed. Encoding of cue features in the NAc may enable contextual modulation of ongoing behavior, and provide an eligibility trace of outcome-predictive stimuli for updating stimulus-outcome associations to inform future behavior.","10.7554/elife.37275"

In this study, we investigated the function of the two T. brucei kinesin-2 proteins, TbKin2a and TbKin2b, in bloodstream form trypanosomes. We found that compared to other kinesin-2 proteins, TbKin2a and TbKin2b show greater variation in neck, stalk, and tail domain sequences. Both kinesins contributed additively to flagellar lengthening. Surprisingly, silencing TbKin2a inhibited cell proliferation, cytokinesis and motility, whereas silencing TbKin2b did not. TbKin2a was localized on the flagellum and colocalized with IFT components near the basal body, consistent with it performing a role in IFT. TbKin2a was also detected on the flagellar attachment zone, a specialized structure in trypanosome cells that connects the flagellum to the cell body. Our results indicate that kinesin-2 proteins in trypanosomes play conserved roles in IFT and exhibit a specialized localization, emphasizing the evolutionary flexibility of motor protein function in an organism with a large complement of kinesins.","NA"

In order to extend such a study to beech stands of different age classes, it was necessary to build biomass and biomass increment equations that could be used for any age; we call them generalized biomass equations.\n\nTo build such generalized equations, trees were sampled in different forest plots covering the whole age range. Moreover, in each plot, several trees were chosen to represent the different crown classes (from dominant to suppressed). Sampled trees were felled down and the root system excavated for a sub-sample of trees, for biomass analysis by separating the main compartments of the above and belowground tree parts. When it was not possible to measure the total biomass of a given tree compartment (large trees), wood samples were taken in the concerned compartment. Moreover, equations were built to estimate the biomass of the missing parts of the root system and branch compartments that were likely to have suffered losses during root excavation and tree felling, respectively. Multivariate linear and non-linear models including possible random effects were tested to represent the biomass and biomass increment variations of each tree compartment and of their aggregation in the above and belowground parts of the tree.\n\nCompatible biomass and biomass increment equations for the different tree compartments and their combination in above and belowground tree parts were developed and fitted, allowing the analysis of the variations of the biomass distribution and allocation with tree age.

Understanding the causes of mate choice is important, because assortative mating (AM) if based upon heritable traits, has genetic and evolutionary consequences. AM is predicted under Fishers classical theory1 to induce a signature in the genome at trait-associated loci that can be detected and quantified. Here, we develop and apply a method to quantify AM on a specific trait by estimating the correlation ({theta}) between genetic predictors of the trait from SNPs on odd versus even chromosomes. We show by theory and simulation that the effect of AM can be distinguished from population stratification. We applied this approach to 32 complex traits and diseases using SNP data from [~]400,000 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We found significant evidence of AM for height ({theta}=3.2%) and educational attainment ({theta}=2.7%), both consistent with theoretical predictions. Overall, our results imply that AM involves multiple traits, affects the genomic architecture of loci that are associated with these traits and that the consequence of mate choice can be detected from a random sample of genomes.","10.1038/s41562-018-0476-3"

Two type III secretion systems (TTSSs) are responsible for the delivery of a series of bacterial effectors into the infected cells to reprogram host cell functions to promote bacterial invasion and intracellular survival/replication. Nearly half of Salmonella genes encode proteins that are annotated as \""hypothetical\"". We hypothesize that some of these hypothetical proteins might be TTSS effectors and participate in Salmonella virulence. In this study, we employed an in silico screen to identify putative TTSS effector proteins and performed a large scale screening of Salmonella effectors using a {beta}-lactamase protein translocation reporter assay. We identified 22 novel effectors that have not been previously reported. One of the effector - YggG, is found to be cytotoxic to mammalian cells when overexpressed suggesting interference with mammalian cell functions and survival. Importantly, Salmonella strains lacking YggG has reduced virulence in the mouse infection model. Our study demonstrated that YggG and its protease activity are required for Salmonella virulence in the mouse infection model. Surprisingly, no detectable roles in invasion into epithelial cells and no effect on the survival and replication inside cultured macrophages. We speculate that YggG may be involved in altering some aspects of the host immune system to promote infection.

Genetic deletion of various types of nAChRs, located on specific interneurons, impacts the properties of ultra-slow transitions between high and low activity states (H-states and L-states, respectively), recorded in mice during quiet wakefulness. In addition, recent data indicate that a genetic mutation of the 5 nAChR subunit located on vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) inhibitory neurons, the rs16969968 single nucleotide polymorphism (5 SNP), appears to be responsible for \""hypofrontality\"" observed in schizophrenia. Chronic nicotine application to 5 SNP mice restores neural activity to control levels. Using firing rate models of hierarchically organized neural populations, we showed that the change of activity patterns recorded in the genetically modified mice can be explained by a change of activity state stability, differentially modulated by cholinergic inputs to parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM) or VIP inhibitory populations. A change in amplitude, but not duration of H-states fully account for the lowered pyramidal (PYR) firing rates recorded in 5 SNP mice. We demonstrate that desensitization and upregulation of {beta}2 nAChRs located on SOM interneurons, but not activation of 5 nAChRs located on VIP interneurons, by chronic nicotine application could account for activity normalization recorded in 5 SNP mice. The model implies that subsequent nicotine withdrawal should lead to PYR activity depression more severe than the original hypofrontality caused by SNP mutation.","NA"

One common challenge in studying biological networks is the need to extract meaningful, small subgraphs out of large databases of potential interactions. A useful abstraction for this task turned out to be the Steiner network problems: given a reference \""database\"" graph, find a parsimonious subgraph that satisfies a given set of connectivity demands. While this formulation proved useful in a number of instances, the next challenge is to account for the fact that the reference graph may not be static. This can happen for instance, when studying protein measurements in single cells or at different time points, whereby different subsets of conditions can have different protein milieu.\n\nResults and DiscussionWe introduce the condition Steiner network problem in which we concomitantly consider a set of distinct biological conditions. Each condition is associated with a set of connectivity demands, as well as a set of edges that are assumed to be present in that condition. The goal of this problem is to find a minimal subgraph that satisfies all the demands through paths that are present in the respective condition. We show that introducing multiple conditions as an additional factor makes this problem much harder to approximate. Specifically, we prove that for C conditions, this new problem is NP-hard to approximate to a factor of C -{epsilon} , for every C [&ge;] 2 and{epsilon} > 0, and that this bound is tight. Moving beyond the worst case, we explore a special set of instances where the reference graph grows monotonically between conditions, and show that this problem admits substantially improved approximation algorithms. We also developed an integer linear programming solver for the general problem and demonstrate its ability to reach optimality with instances from the human protein interaction network.\n\nConclusionOur results demonstrate that in contrast to most connectivity problems studied in computational biology, accounting for multiplicity of biological conditions adds considerable complexity, which we propose to address with a new solver. Importantly, our results extend to several network connectivity problems that are commonly used in computational biology, such as Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree, and provide insight into the theoretical guarantees for their applications in a multiple condition setting.\n\nAvailabilityOur solver for the general condition Steiner network problem is available at https://github.com/YosefLab/condition_connectivity_problems","10.1186/s13015-019-0141-z"

Spear","Colorado School of Mines","2018-04-13",1,"4","new results","microbiology","Snowfall is a global phenomenon highly integrated with hydrology and ecology. Forays into studying bioaerosols and their dependence on aeolian movement are largely constrained to either precipitation-independent analyses or in-silico models. Though snowpack and glacial microbiological studies have been conducted, little is known about the biological component of meteoric snow. Through culture-independent phylogenetic and geochemical analyses, we show that the geographical location at which snow precipitates determines snowfalls geochemical and microbiological composition. Storm-tracking, furthermore, can be used as a valuable environmental indicator to trace down what factors are influencing bioaerosols. We estimate annual deposits of up to ~10 kg of bacterial / archaeal biomass per hectare along our study area of the eastern Front Range in Colorado. The dominant kinds of microbiota captured in an analysis of seven snow events at two different locations, one urban, one rural, across the winter of 2016/2017 included phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria, though a multitude of different kinds of organisms were found in both. Taxonomically, Bacteroidetes were more abundant in Golden (urban plain) snow while Proteobacteria were more common in Sunshine (rural mountain) samples. Chemically, Golden snowfall was positively correlated with some metals and anions. The work also hints at better informing the  everything is everywhere hypotheses of the microbial world and that atmospheric transport of microbiota is not only common, but is capable of disseminating vast amounts of microbiota of different physiologies and genetics that then affect ecosystems globally. Snowfall, we conclude, is a significant repository of microbiological material with strong implications for both ecosystem genetic flux and general bio-aerosol theory.\n\nImportanceSnowfall is commonplace to the temperate and polar regions of the world. As an interface between the atmosphere, hydrosphere and earth, snow is responsible for high annual deposits of moisture globally, and, can serve as a  water bank in the form of both permanent snow fields and glaciers. Essential to general ecosystem function, snow can also be considered a transporter of aerosolized material. Given the magnitude of microbiota deposited by snowfall, which we report, it is likely that biological material within snowfall, with its geochemical underpinning-- and the associated genetic banks--have significant downstream ecological effects.\n\nUnderstanding what is contained in snowfall becomes especially urgent in a warming climate where high-impact meteorological and ecological changes are imminent and likely. With climate-induced changes to snowfall patterns, surface ecosystems are likely to be impacted by ensuing changes in microbiota deposition. Thus, the ecosystem function of soils, rock and surface waters are also likely to be impacted; these changes, in turn, greatly influence agriculture, weathering and infrastructure.","10.7717/peerj.5961"

Herein, we established a proof-of-concept mono-homologous linear DNA recombination for gene inactivation or genome editing by which cyclization of linear DNA in vivo by NHEJ could be used to generate non-replicable circular DNA and could allow allelic exchanges between the circular DNA and the chromosome. We achieved this approach in Dietzia sp. DQ12-45-1b, which expresses Ku and LigD homologs and presents NHEJ activity. By transforming the strain with a linear DNA mono homolog to the sequence in chromosome, we mutated the genome. This method did not require the screening of suitable plasmids and was easy and time-effective. Bioinformatic analysis showed that more than 20% prokaryotic organisms contain Ku and LigD, suggesting the wide distribution of NHEJ activities.

Drug resistance in cancer is a multipart phenomenon which can be derived from several origins and in many cases it has been observed that cancer cells have the ability to possess, acquire and communicate drug resistant traits.\n\nHere, an in silico framework is developed in order to study drug resistance and drug response in cancer cell populations exhibiting various drug resistant features. The framework is based on an on-lattice hybrid multiscale mathematical model and is equipped to simulate multiple mechanisms on different scales that contribute towards chemotherapeutic drug resistance in cancer. This study demonstrates how drug resistant tumour features may depend on the interplay amongst intracellular, extracelluar and intercellular factors. On a cellular level, drug resistant cell phenotypes are here derived from inheritance or mutations that are spontaneous, drug-induced or communicated via exosomes. Furthermore intratumoural heterogeneity and spatio-temporal drug dynamics heavily influences drug delivery and the development of drug resistant cancer cell subpopulations. Chemotherapy treatment strategies are here optimised for various in silico tumour scenarios and treatment objectives.

In international field trials, the cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) drive system of wMel Wolbachia is deployed to replace target vector populations, whereby a Wolbachia- induced modification of the sperm genome kills embryos. However, Wolbachia in the embryo rescue the sperm genome impairment, and therefore CI results in a strong fitness advantage for infected females that transmit the bacteria to offspring. The two genes responsible for the wMel-induced sperm modification of CI, cifA and cifB, were recently identified in the eukaryotic association module of prophage WO, but the genetic basis of rescue is unresolved. Here we use transgenic and cytological approaches to demonstrate that cifA independently rescues CI and nullifies embryonic death caused by wMel Wolbachia in Drosophila melanogaster. Discovery of cifA as the rescue gene and previously one of two CI induction genes establishes a new  Two-by-One model that underpins the genetic basis of CI. Results highlight the central role of prophage WO in shaping Wolbachia phenotypes that are significant to arthropod evolution and vector control.\n\nSignificance StatementThe World Health Organization recommended pilot deployment of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to curb viral transmission to humans. Releases of mosquitoes are underway worldwide because Wolbachia can block replication of these pathogenic viruses and deterministically spread by a drive system termed cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). Despite extensive research, the underlying genetic basis of CI remains only half-solved. We recently reported that two prophage WO genes recapitulate the modification component of CI in a released strain for vector control. Here we show that one of these genes underpins rescue of CI. Together, our results reveal the complete genetic basis of this selfish trait and pave the way for future studies exploring WO prophage genes as adjuncts or alternatives to current control efforts.","10.1073/pnas.1800650115"

However, genome editing of long-term repopulating HSCs to correct mutated alleles has been challenging. HSCs have the ability to either be quiescent or cycle, with the former linked to stemness and the latter involved in differentiation. Here we investigate the link between cell cycle status and genome editing outcomes at the causative codon for sickle cell disease in adult human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We show that quiescent HSPCs that are immunophenotypically enriched for engrafting stem cells predominantly repair Cas9-induced double strand breaks (DSBs) through an error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway and exhibit almost no homology directed repair (HDR). By contrast, non-quiescent cycling stem-enriched cells repair Cas9 DSBs through both error-prone NHEJ and fidelitous HDR. Pre-treating bulk CD34+ HSPCs with a combination of mTOR and GSK-3 inhibitors to induce quiescence results in complete loss of HDR in all cell subtypes. We used these compounds, which were initially developed to maintain HSCs in culture, to create a new strategy for editing adult human HSCs. CD34+ HSPCs are edited, allowed to briefly cycle to accumulate HDR alleles, and then placed back in quiescence to maintain stemness, resulting in 6-fold increase in HDR/NHEJ ratio in quiescent, stem-enriched cells. Our results reveal the fundamental tension between quiescence and editing in human HSPCs and suggests strategies to manipulate HSCs during therapeutic genome editing.","NA"

We hypothesized that variant effect-sizes should increase when individuals who represent the extreme ends of a disease spectrum are considered, as their genomes are assumed to be maximally enriched or depleted with disease-associated genetic variants.\n\nWe used 1,073 extensively phenotyped AD cases with relatively young age at onset as extreme cases (66.3{+/-}7.9 years), 1,664 age-matched controls (66.0{+/-}6.5 years) and 255 cognitively healthy centenarians as extreme controls (101.4{+/-}1.3 years). We estimated the effect-size of 29 variants that were previously associated with AD in genome-wide association studies.\n\nComparing extreme AD-cases with centenarian-controls increased the variant effect-size relative to published effect-sizes by on average 1.90-fold (SE=0.29, p=9.0x10-4). The effect-size increase was largest for the rare high-impact TREM2 (R74H) variant (6.5-fold), and significant for variants in/near ECHDC3 (4.6-fold), SLC24A4-RIN3 (4.5-fold), NME8 (3.8-fold), PLCG2 (3.3-fold), APOE-{varepsilon}2 (2.2-fold) and APOE-{varepsilon}4 (2.0-fold). Comparing extreme phenotypes enabled us to replicate the AD association for 10 variants (p<0.05) in relatively small samples. The increase in effect-sizes depended mainly on using centenarians as extreme controls: the average variant effect-size was not increased in a comparison of extreme AD cases and age-matched controls (0.94-fold, p=6.8x10-1), suggesting that on average the tested genetic variants did not explain the extremity of the AD-cases. Concluding, using centenarians as extreme controls in AD case-controls studies boosts the variant effect-size by on average two-fold, allowing the replication of disease-association in relatively small samples.","10.1038/s41431-018-0273-5"

In glioblastoma tumors, some components of the native brain ECM such as hyaluronic acid (HA) have been suggested as key regulators of processes associated with poor patient outlook such as invasion and therapeutic resistance. Given the importance of cell-mediated remodeling during invasion, it is likely that the molecular weight of available HA polymer may strongly influence GBM progression. Biomaterial platforms therefore provide a unique opportunity to systematically examine the influence of the molecular weight distribution of HA on GBM cell activity. Here we report the relationship between the molecular weight of matrix-bound HA within a methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel, the invasive phenotype of a patient-derived xenograft GBM population that exhibits significant in vivo invasivity, and the local production of soluble HA during GBM cell invasion. Hyaluronic acid of different molecular weights spanning a range associated with cell-mediated remodeling (10, 60, and 500 kDa) was photopolymerized into GelMA hydrogels, with cell activity compared to GelMA only conditions (-HA). Polymerization conditions were tuned to create a homologous series of GelMA hydrogels with conserved poroelastic properties (i.e. shear modulus, Poissons ratio, and diffusivity). GBM migration was strongly influenced by HA molecular weight. While markers associated with active remodeling of the HA content, hyaluronan synthase and hyaluronidase, were found to be insensitive to matrix immobilized HA content. These results provide new information regarding the importance of local hyaluronic acid content on the invasive phenotype of GBM.","10.3389/fmats.2018.00039"

Therefore, a single genotype may have different additive genetic values in different populations. The correlation between the two additive genetic values of a single genotype in both populations is known as the additive genetic correlation between populations and can differ from one. Our objective was to investigate whether differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allele frequencies of markers and causal loci between populations affect bias of the estimated genetic correlation. We simulated two populations that were separated for 50 generations. Markers and causal loci were selected to either have similar or different allele frequencies in the two populations. Differences in consistency of LD between populations were obtained by using different marker density panels. Results showed that when the difference in allele frequencies of causal loci between populations was reflected by the markers, genetic correlations were only slightly underestimated using markers. This was even the case when LD patterns, measured by LD statistic r, were different between populations. When the difference in allele frequencies of causal loci between populations was not reflected by the markers, genetic correlations were severely underestimated. We conclude that for an unbiased estimate of the genetic correlation between populations, marker allele frequencies should reflect allele frequencies of causal loci so that marker-based relationships can accurately predict the relationships at causal loci, i.e. E(Gcausal loci|Gmarkers) = Gmarkers. Differences in LD between populations have little effect on the estimated genetic correlation.","10.1186/s12711-018-0434-6"

Multiple small GTPases in the Rab family are known to function in phagosome maturation by regulating vesicle trafficking. We discovered rab-35 as a new gene important for apoptotic cell clearance using an RNAi screen targeting putative Rab GTPases in Caenorhabditis elegans. We further identified TBC-10 as a putative GTPase-activating protein (GAP), and FLCN-1 and RME-4 as two putative Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs), for RAB-35. RAB-35 function was found to be required for the incorporation of early endosomes to phagosomes and for the timely degradation of apoptotic cell corpses. More specifically, RAB-35 facilitates the switch of phagosomal membrane phosphatidylinositol species from PtdIns(4,5)P2 to PtdIns(3)P and promotes the recruitment of the small GTPase RAB-5 to phagosomal surfaces, processes that are essential for phagosome maturation. Interestingly, we observed that CED-1 performs these same functions, and to a much larger extent than RAB-35. Remarkably, in addition to cell corpse degradation, RAB-35 also facilitates the recognition of cell corpses independently of the CED-1 and CED-5 pathways. RAB-35 localizes to extending pseudopods and is further enriched on nascent phagosomes, consistent with its dual roles in regulating cell corpse-recognition and phagosome maturation. Epistasis analyses indicate that rab-35 represents a novel third genetic pathway that acts in parallel to both of the canonical ced-1/6/7 and ced-2/5/10/12 engulfment pathways. We propose that RAB-35 acts as a robustness factor, leading a pathway that aids the canonical pathways for the engulfment and degradation of apoptotic cells.","NA"

Microbial communities in streams play important functional roles and their composition and metabolic potential can help assess ecological state and water quality. Although these environments are highly heterogenous, little is known about the influence of isolated perturbations, such as those resulting from rain events on urban stream microbiota. Here, we examined the microbial community composition and diversity in an urban stream during dry and wet weather conditions with both 16S rRNA gene sequencing across multiple years and shotgun metagenomics to more deeply analyze a single stormflow event. Metagenomics was used to assess population-level dynamics as well as shifts in the microbial community taxonomic profile and functional potential before and after a substantial rainfall. Results demonstrated general trends present in the stream under stormflow vs. baseflow conditions across years and seasons and also highlighted the significant influence of increased effluent flow following rain in shifting the stream microbial community from abundant freshwater taxa to those more associated with urban/anthropogenic settings. Shifts in the taxonomic composition were also linked to changes in functional gene content, particularly for transmembrane transport and organic substance biosynthesis. We also observed an increase in relative abundance of genes encoding degradation of organic pollutants and antibiotic resistance after rain. Overall, this study provided evidence of stormflow impacts on an urban stream microbiome from an environmental and public health perspective.\n\nImportanceUrban streams in various parts of the world are facing increased anthropogenic pressure on their water quality, and stormflow events represent one such source of complex physical, chemical and biological perturbations.

Comparing alternative splicing targets of hnRNPM and ESRP1 revealed that they co-regulate a set of cassette exon events, with the majority showing discordant splicing regulation. hnRNPM discordantly regulated splicing events show a positive correlation with splicing during EMT while concordant splicing events do not, highlighting the antagonistic role of hnRNPM and ESRP1 during EMT.

To fill this gap the main objective of this work was to assess the metabolic properties of the yeasts isolated from honey and pollen from beehives of northeast Austria.\n\nThe biodiversity was low and only two yeast species were identified, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Candida apicola. The fermentation potentials of these yeasts were estimated in two media, grape juice (since yeasts isolated from honey may be useful for sweet wine production) and diluted honey of similar sugar concentration, and compared with those of the reference strains Saccharomyces cerevisiae; S. uvarum and S. eubayanus. Depending on the fermentation substrate, yeasts differed with respect to their metabolic power, fermentation rate, sugar utilization and production of glycerol and organic acids. During mead fermentation Saccharomyces species showed the highest metabolic turnover, while the fermentation rate did not differ significantly. Addition of assimilable nitrogen to the diluted honey enhanced fermentation rate of S. cerevisiae, but not of the other species. Fermentation of grape juice occurred much faster than that of diluted honey and differences between yeasts were more pronounced. The S. cerevisiae commercial wine strain, adapted to high alcohol concentrations, and S. eubayanus outperformed the others, S. uvarum was comparable with Z. rouxii, while C. apicola had the lowest fermentation rate. Fructophily of Z. rouxii and to a lesser degree of C. apicola was observed in both media. An increased production of glycerol was achieved by S. eubayanus in both media and by C. apicola during the fermentation of honey must.

The close relationship amongst recent ST-261 isolates from Ghana, USA and China with the Israeli tilapia isolate from 1988 implicates the global trade in tilapia seed for aquaculture in the widespread dissemination of serotype Ib fish-adapted GBS.\n\nImportanceStreptococcus agalactiae (GBS) is a significant pathogen of humans and animals. Some lineages have become adapted to particular hosts and serotype Ib is highly specialized to fish. Here we show that this lineage is likely to have been distributed widely by the global trade in tilapia for aquaculture, with probable introduction into Australia in the 1970s and subsequent dissemination in wild fish populations. We report variability in the polysaccharide capsule amongst this lineage, but identify a cohort common surface proteins that may be a focus of future vaccine development to reduce the biosecurity risk in international fish trade.","10.1128/aem.00859-18"

We used the synchronization system called Retention Using Selective Hook (RUSH) to study Wnt trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi and then to plasma membrane and filopodia in real time. Consistent with prior studies, inhibition of porcupine (PORCN) or knockout of Wntless (WLS) blocked Wnt exit from the ER. Indeed, WLS was rate-limiting for Wnt ER exit. Wnt-containing vesicles paused at sub-cortical regions of the plasma membrane before exiting the cell. Wnt-containing vesicles were transported to adjacent cells associated with filopodia. Increasing the number of filopodia by expression of LGR5 in the producing cell increased the ability of a cell to send a Wnt signal. The RUSH system is a powerful tool to provide new insights into the Wnt secretory pathway.","NA"

To enable further immune response studies, Brucella were engineered to express the well characterized chicken ovalbumin (OVA). Surprisingly, we found that CD8 T cells bearing T cell receptors (TCR) nominally specific for the OVA peptide SIINFEKL (OT-1) reacted to parental Brucella-infected targets as well as OVA-expressing Brucella variants in cytotoxicity assays. Furthermore, splenocytes from Brucella immunized mice produced IFN-{gamma} and exhibited cytotoxicity in response to SIINFEKL-pulsed target cells. To determine if the SIINFEKL-reactive OT-1 TCR could be cross-reacting to Brucella peptides, we searched the Brucella proteome using an algorithm to generate a list of near-neighbor nonamer peptides that would bind to H2Kb. Selecting five Brucella peptide candidates, along with controls, we verified that several of these peptides mimicked SIINFEKL resulting in T cell activation through the \""SIINFEKL-specific\"" TCR. Activation was dependent on peptide concentration as well as sequence. Our results underscore the complexity and ubiquity of cross-reactivity in T cell recognition. This cross-reactivity may enable microbes such as Brucella to escape immune surveillance by presenting peptides similar to the host, and may also lead to the activation of autoreactive T cells.","10.1128/iai.00281-18"

Phytoconstituents like vitexin have long been in use for their antibacterial effect. The present work is aimed to characterise the effect of vitexin on S. aureus surface hydrophobicity and corresponding aggregation to form biofilm. We have found that vitexin shows minimum inhibitory concentration at 252 g/ml against S. aureus. Vitexin reduces cell surface hydrophobicity and membrane permeability at sub-MIC dose of 126 g/ml. The in silico binding analysis showed higher binding affinity of vitexin with surface proteins of S. aureus. Down regulation of dltA, icaAB and reduction in membrane potential under sub-MIC dose of vitexin, explains reduced S. aureus surface hydrophobicity. Vitexin has substantially reduced the intracellular adhesion of planktonic cells to form biofilm through interference of EPS formation, motility and subsequent execution of virulence. This was supported by the observation that vitexin down regulates the expression of icaAB and agrAC genes of S. aureus. In addition, vitexin also found to potentiate antibiofilm activity of sub-MIC dose of gentamicin and azithromycin. Furthermore, CFU count, histological examination of mouse tissue and immunomodulatory study justifies the in vivo protective effect of vitexin from S. aureus biofilm associated infection. Finally it can be inferred that, vitexin has the ability to modulate S. aureus cell surface hydrophobicity which can further interfere biofilm formation of the bacteria.\n\nImportanceThere has been substantial information known about role of bacterial surface hydrophobicity during attachment of single planktonic bacterial cells to any surface and the subsequent development of mature biofilm. This study presents the effect of flavone phytoconstituent vitexin on modulation of cell surface hydrophobicity in reducing formation of biofilm. Our findings also highlight the ability of vitexin in reducing in vivo S. aureus biofilm which will eventually outcompete the corresponding in vitro antibiofilm effect. Synergistic effect of vitexin on azithromycin and gentamicin point to a regime where development of drug tolerance may be addressed. Our findings explore one probable way of overcoming drug tolerance through application of vitexin in addressing the issue of S. aureus biofilm through modulation of cell surface hydrophobicity.","NA"

Being an iron-reducing bacterium, A6 was studied as a potential electrode-reducing bacterium that may transfer electrons extracellularly onto electrodes while gaining energy from ammonium oxidation. Actinobacteria species have been overlooked as electrogenic bacteria, and the importance of lithoautotrophic iron-reducers as electrode-reducing bacteria at anodes has not been addressed. By installing electrodes in soil of a forested riparian wetland where A6 thrives, as well as in A6 bioaugmented constructed wetland (CW) mesocosms, characteristics and performances of this organism as an electrode-reducing bacterium candidate were investigated. In this study, we show that Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 is a lithoautotrophic bacterium, capable of colonizing electrodes in the field as well as in CW mesocosoms, and that it appears to be an electrode-reducing bacterium since there was a boost in current production shortly after the CWs were seeded with Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6.\n\nIMPORTANCEMost studies on electrogenic microorganisms have focused on the most abundant heterotrophs, while other microorganisms also commonly present in electrode microbial communities such as Actinobacteria have been overlooked. The novel Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 (Actinobacteria) is an iron-reducing bacterium that can colonize the surface of anodes and is linked to electrical current production, making it an electrode-reducing candidate. Furthermore, A6 can carry out anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to iron reduction, therefore, findings from this study open up the possibility of using electrodes instead of iron as electron acceptors as a mean to promote A6 to treat ammonium containing wastewater more efficiently. Altogether, this study expands our knowledge on electrogenic bacteria and opens up the possibility to develop Feammox based technologies coupled to bioelectric systems for the treatment NH4+ and other contaminants in anoxic systems.","10.1128/AEM.02029-18"

Considered to be the primary causative agent of dental caries, S. mutans harbors a 25kDa SloR metalloregulatory protein which controls metal ion transport across the bacterial cell membrane to maintain essential metal ion homeostasis. The expression of SloR derives, in part, from transcriptional readthrough of the sloABC operon which encodes a Mn2+/Fe2+ ABC transport system. Herein, we describe the details of the sloABC promoter that drives this transcription, as well as a novel independent promoter in an intergenic region (IGR) that contributes to downstream sloR expression. RT-PCR studies support sloR transcription that is independent of sloABC expression, and the results of 5' RACE revealed a sloR transcription start site in the IGR from which the -10 and -35 promoter regions were predicted. The results of gel mobility shift assays support direct SloR binding to the IGR, albeit with lower affinity than SloR binding to the sloABCR promoter. Function of the sloR promoter was validated in qRT-PCR experiments. Interestingly, sloR expression was not significantly impacted when grown in the presence of high manganese, whereas expression of the sloABC operon was repressed under these conditions. The results of in vitro transcription studies support SloR-mediated transcriptional-activation of sloR and -repression of sloABC. Taken together, these findings implicate SloR as a bifunctional regulator that represses sloABC promoter activity and encourages sloR transcription from an independent promoter.\n\nImportanceTooth decay is a ubiquitous infectious disease that is especially pervasive in underserved communities worldwide. S. mutans-induced carious lesions cause functional, physical, and/or aesthetic impairment in the vast majority of adults, and in 60-90% of schoolchildren in industrialized countries. Billions of dollars are spent annually on caries treatment, and productivity losses due to absenteeism from the workplace are significant. Research aimed at alleviating S. mutans-induced tooth decay is important because it can address the socioeconomic disparity that is associated with dental cavities and improve overall general health which is inextricably linked to oral health. Research focused on the S. mutans SloR metalloregulatory protein can guide the development of novel therapeutics and so alleviate the burden of dental cavities.","10.1128/JB.00214-18"

This representation was achieved by diverse receptive fields (RFs) of the small number of highly responsive neurons. Furthermore, these neurons reliably represented the image across trials, regardless of trial-to-trial response variability.

We have developed a knowledge-based model of the competence cycle that describes average cell behavior. It reveals that the expression rates of the two competence operon, comAB and comCDE, involved in the positive feedback loop must be coordinated to elicit spontaneous competence. Simulations revealed the requirement for an unknown late com gene product that shuts of competence by impairing ComX activity. Further simulations led to the predictions that the membrane protein ComD bound to CSP reacts directly to pH change of the medium and that blindness to CSP during the post-competence phase is controlled by late DprA protein.

Among those strategies, Type IV effectors (T4Es) are proteins secreted by pathogenic bacteria to manipulate host cell processes during infection. They are delivered into eukaryotic cells in an ATP-dependent manner via the type IV secretion system, a specialized multiprotein complex. T4Es contain a wide spectrum of features including eukaryotic-like domains, localization signals or a C-terminal translocation signal. A combination of these features enables prediction of T4Es in a given bacterial genome. In this study, we developed a web-based comprehensive suite of tools with a user-friendly graphical interface. This version 2.0 of S4TE (Searching Algorithm for Type IV Effector Proteins; http://sate.cirad.fr) enables accurate prediction and comparison of T4Es. Search parameters and threshold can be customized by the user to work with any genome sequence, whether publicly available or not. Applications range from characterizing effector features and identifying potential T4Es to analyzing the effectors based on the genome G+C composition and local gene density. S4TE 2.0 allows the comparison of putative T4E repertoires of up to four bacterial strains at the same time. The software identifies T4E orthologs among strains and provides a Venn diagram and lists of genes for each intersection. New interactive features offer the best visualization of the location of candidate T4Es and hyperlinks to NCBI and Pfam databases. S4TE 2.0 is designed to evolve rapidly with the publication of new experimentally validated T4Es, which will reinforce the predictive power of the algorithm. The computational methodology can be used to identify a wide spectrum of candidate bacterial effectors that lack sequence conservation but have similar amino acid characteristics. This approach will provide very valuable information about bacterial host-specificity and virulence factors, and help identify host targets for the development of new anti-bacterial molecules.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006847"

In the case of proteomics, where methods frequently result in missing data this increasing scale is also decreasing the number of peptides observed in all samples. The sources of batch effects and missing data are incompletely understood necessitating novel techniques.\n\nResultsHere we show that by exploiting the structure of time series experiments, it is possible to accurately and reproducibly model and remove batch effects. We implement Learning and Imputation for Mass-spec Bias Reduction (LIMBR) software, which builds on previous block based models of batch effects and includes features specific to time series and circadian studies. To aid in the analysis of time series proteomics experiments, which are often plagued with missing data points, we also integrate an imputation system. By building LIMBR for imputation and time series tailored bias modeling into one straightforward software package, we expect that the quality and ease of large-scale proteomics and genomics time series experiments will be significantly increased.\n\nContactalexander.m.crowell@gmail.com, jay.c.dunlap@dartmouth.edu","10.1093/bioinformatics/bty828"

The present study thus investigates how well humans discriminate visually presented gravities and which cues they use to extract gravity from the visual scene.

To date, missense mutations at more than 80 different amino acid positions have been associated with disease. How these mutations perturb native structure to heighten the propensity to misfold and aggregate is unclear. One potential mechanism that has been suggested is that when mutations occur at positions occupied by charged amino acids, then repulsive forces that would inhibit aberrant protein:protein interactions would be reduced. Mutations at twenty-one charged residues in SOD1 have been associated with fALS. Here, we examined whether loss of positively charged surface Lys residues would induce the misfolding and aggregation of SOD1. We randomly mutated four different Lys residues (K30, K36, K75, K91) in SOD1 and expressed these variants as fusion proteins with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). We also assessed whether these mutations induced binding to a conformation-restricted SOD1 antibody, designated C4F6, which recognizes non-natively folded protein. Our findings indicate that SOD1 generally tolerates mutations at surface exposed lysine residues, and that loss of positive charge is insufficient to induce aggregation. Our findings may explain why mutations at these Lys residues have not been identified in ALS patients.","10.1371/journal.pone.0206751"

Our data indicate that ACCESS detects 10% more coding SNV/INDELs with respect to POLYA, making this protocol more suitable for this goal. Furthermore, ACCESS requires less reads for coding SNV detection with respect to POLYA.

One such family of presynaptic proteins are the neurexins (NRXN), and recent genetic and mouse evidence has suggested a causative role for NRXN2 in generating altered social behaviours. Autism has been conceptualised as a disorder of atypical connectivity, yet how single-gene mutations affect such connectivity remains under-explored. To attempt to address this, we have developed a quantitative analysis of microstructure and structural connectivity leveraging diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) with high-resolution 3D imaging in optically cleared (CLARITY) brain tissue in the same mouse, applied here to the Nrxn2 knockout (KO) model.

MethodsFixed brains of Nrxn2 KO mice underwent DTI using 9.4T MRI, and diffusion properties of socially-relevant brain regions were quantified. The same tissue was then subjected to CLARITY to immunolabel axons and cell bodies, which were also quantified.

ResultsDTI revealed decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in apparent diffusion coefficient in the amygdala (including the basolateral nuclei), the anterior cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Radial diffusivity of the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex was significantly increased in Nrxn2 KO mice, as were tracts between the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex. Using CLARITY, we find significantly altered axonal orientation in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, which was unrelated to cell density.

ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that deleting a single neurexin gene (Nrxn2) induces atypical structural connectivity within socially-relevant brain regions. More generally, our combined within-subject DTI and CLARITY approach presents a new, more sensitive method of revealing hitherto undetectable differences in the autistic brain.","10.1186/s13229-019-0261-9"

Despite its importance for wheat research, no consensus on the phylogeny of the wheat clade has emerged so far, possibly because of hybridizations and gene flows that make phylogeny reconstruction challenging. Recently, it has been proposed that the D genome originated from an ancient hybridization event between the A and B genomes1. However, the study only relied on four diploid wheat relatives when 13 species are accessible. Using transcriptome data from all diploid species and a new methodological approach, we provide the first comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of this group. Our analysis reveals that most species belong to the D-genome lineage and descend from the previously detected hybridization event, but with a more complex scenario and with a different parent than previously thought. If we confirmed that one parent was the A genome, we found that the second was not the B genome but the ancestor of Aegilops mutica (T genome), an overlooked wild species. We also unravel evidence of other massive gene flow events that could explain long-standing controversies in the classification of wheat relatives. We anticipate that these results will strongly affect future wheat research by providing a robust evolutionary framework and refocusing interest on understudied species.

A.","Christopher DeBoever","Stanford University","2018-04-14",5,"1","new results","genetics","Whole genome sequencing studies applied to large populations or biobanks with extensive phenotyping raise new analytic challenges. The need to consider many variants at a locus or group of genes simultaneously and the potential to study many correlated phenotypes with shared genetic architecture provide opportunities for discovery and inference that are not addressed by the traditional one variant-one phenotype association study. Here we introduce a model comparison approach we refer to as MRP for rare variant association studies that considers correlation, scale, and location of genetic effects across a group of genetic variants, phenotypes, and studies. We consider the use of summary statistic data to apply univariate and multivariate gene-based meta-analysis models for identifying rare variant associations with an emphasis on protective protein-truncating variants that can expedite drug discovery. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed model comparison approach can improve ability to detect rare variant association signals. We also apply the model to two groups of phenotypes from the UK Biobank: 1) asthma diagnosis, eosinophil counts, forced expiratory volume, and forced vital capacity; and 2) glaucoma diagnosis, intra-ocular pressure, and corneal resistance factor. We are able to recover known associations such as the protective association between rs146597587 in IL33 and asthma. We also find evidence for novel protective associations between rare variants in ANGPTL7 and glaucoma. Overall, we show that the MRP model comparison approach is able to retain and improve upon useful features from widely-used meta-analysis approaches for rare variant association analyses and prioritize protective modifiers of disease risk.\n\nAuthor summaryDue to the continually decreasing cost of acquiring genetic data, we are now beginning to see large collections of individuals for which we have both genetic information and trait data such as disease status, physical measurements, biomarker levels, and more. These datasets offer new opportunities to find relationships between inherited genetic variation and disease. While it is known that there are relationships between different traits, typical genetic analyses only focus on analyzing one genetic variant and one phenotype at a time. Additionally, it is difficult to identify rare genetic variants that are associated with disease due to their scarcity, even among large sample sizes. In this work, we present a method for identifying associations between genetic variation and disease that considers multiple rare variants and phenotypes at the same time. By sharing information across rare variant and phenotypes, we improve our ability to identify rare variants associated with disease compared to considering a single rare variant and a single phenotype. The method can be used to identify candidate disease genes as well as genes that might represent attractive drug targets.","NA"

P.; Kelber, A.","Anna Stoeckl","Vision Group, Lund University, Lund, Sweden","2018-04-14",3,"15","new results","neuroscience","Flying animals need constant sensory feedback about their body position and orientation for flight control. The visual system provides essential but slow feedback. In contrast, mechanosensory channels can provide feedback at much shorter timescales. How the contributions from these two senses are integrated remains an open question in most insect groups. In Diptera, fast mechanosensory feedback is provided by organs called halteres, and is crucial for the control of rapid flight manoeuvres, while vision controls manoeuvres in lower temporal frequency bands. Here we have investigated the visual-mechanosensory integration in an insect which lacks halteres: the hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum. They represent a large group of insects that use Johnstons organs in their antennae to provide mechanosensory feedback on perturbations in body position. High-speed videos of freely-flying hawkmoths hovering at stationary or oscillating artificial flowers showed that positional fidelity during flight was reduced in flagella ablated animals, but was recovered after flagella re-attachment. Our experiments show that antennal mechanosensory feedback specifically mediates fast flight manoeuvres, but not slow ones. Differences in the latency of visual feedback (in different light intensities) affected all antennal conditions equally, suggesting there was no compensatory interaction between antennal and visual feedback under the tested conditions. These results establish the importance of antennal mechanosensors in providing rapid mechanosensory feedback for finer control of flight manoeuvres, acting in parallel to visual feedback.","10.7554/eLife.37606"

Bidirectional indices have opened new possibilities in this regard allowing the search to start from anywhere within the pattern and extend in both directions. In particular, use of search schemes (partitioning the pattern and searching the pieces in certain orders with given bounds on errors) can yield significant speed-ups. However, finding optimal search schemes is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem.\n\nHere for the first time, we propose a mixed integer program (MIP) capable to solve this optimization problem for Hamming distance with given number of pieces. Our experiments show that the optimal search schemes found by our MIP significantly improve the performance of search in bidirectional FM-index upon previous ad-hoc solutions. For example, approximate matching of 101-bp Illumina reads (with two errors) becomes 35 times faster than standard backtracking. Moreover, despite being performed purely in the index, the running time of search using our optimal schemes (for up to two errors) is comparable to the best state-of-the-art aligners, which benefit from combining search in index with in-text verification using dynamic programming. As a result, we anticipate a full-fledged aligner that employs an intelligent combination of search in the bidirectional FM-index using our optimal search schemes and in-text verification using dynamic programming that will outperform todays best aligners. The development of such an aligner, called FAMOUS (Fast Approximate string Matching using OptimUm search Schemes), is ongoing as our future work.","NA"

The data presented disparate phenotypes. To dissect vascular mechanisms, a 3D human coronary vasculature model was implemented. Simulations were performed to investigate the effects of altered aortic pressure and blood vessel diameters on myocardial BF heterogeneity which was quantified using relative dispersion, fractal dimension, and transmural BF distribution.\n\nImaging showed that stress and therapy potentially increased mean and total BF, while reducing heterogeneity. BF histograms of one patient showed multi-modality. Using the model, it was found that total coronary BF increased as coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) was increased. BF heterogeneity was differentially affected by large or small vessel blocking. BF heterogeneity was found to be inversely related to small blood vessel diameters. Simulation of large artery stenosis indicates that BF became heterogeneous (increase relative dispersion) and gave multi-modal histograms. The total transmural BF as well as transmural BF heterogeneity reduced due to large artery stenosis, generating large patches of very low O_SCPCAPBFC_SCPCAP regions downstream. Blocking of arteries at various orders showed that blocking larger arteries results in multi-modal BF histograms and large patches of low BF, whereas smaller artery blocking results in augmented relative dispersion and fractal dimension. Transmural heterogeneity was also affected. Finally, the effects of augmented aortic pressure in the presence of blood vessel blocking shows differential effects on BF heterogeneity as well as transmural BF.\n\nImproved aortic blood pressure may lead to improved BF. Stress and therapy may be effective if they dilate small vessels. A potential cause for the observed complex BF distributions (multi-modal BF histograms) may indicate existing large vessel stenosis.\n\nThe intuitive BF heterogeneity methods used can be readily used in clinical studies. Further development of the model and methods will permit personalised assessment of patient BF status.","10.3389/fphys.2018.00511"

FtsZ is a modular protein that encompasses a conserved GTPase domain and a highly variable intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail (CTT). The CTT is essential for forming the cytokinetic Z-ring. Despite poor sequence conservation of the CTT, the patterning of oppositely charged residues, which refers to the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within CTT sequences is bounded within a narrow range. To assess the impact of evolutionary bounds on charge patterning within CTT sequences we performed experiments, aided by sequence design, to quantify the impact of changing the patterning of oppositely charged residues within the CTT on the functions of FtsZ from B. subtilis. Z-ring formation is robust if and only if the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within the CTT sequences is within evolutionarily observed bounds. Otherwise, aberrant, CTT-mediated, FtsZ assemblies impair Z-ring formation. The complexities of CTT sequences also have to be above a threshold value because FtsZ variants with low complexity CTTs are not tolerated in cells. Taken together, our results suggest that CTT sequences have evolved to be \""just right\"" and that this is achieved through an optimal extent of charge patterning while maintaining the sequence complexity above a threshold value.","NA"

We hypothesized that ischemic zones generated by heterogeneous perfusion are a cause of clinically observed post-dialysis arrhythmia. This preliminary study assessed the arrhythmia potential in a heterogeneously perfused 2D human ventricle computational model.\n\nAimOur aim was to ascertain a relationship between the number of ischemia zones and incidence of multiple re-entrant waves in a 2D model of the human ventricle.\n\nMethodsA human ventricle action potential model was modified to include the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensitive potassium current. Within ischemic zones, cell electrophysiological alterations due to ischemia were implemented as increased extracellular potassium, reduced intracellular ATP concentrations, as well as reduced upstroke current conductances. The cell model was incorporated into a spatial 2D model. The inter-cellular gap junction coupling was adjusted to simulate slow conduction in dialysis patient hearts. CT imaging data of the heart obtained during dialysis was analysed to estimate the approximate spatial size of ischemic zones. An ischemic border zone between the normal and central ischemic zones was implemented which had smoothly varying electrophysiological parameters. Arrhythmic potential was assessed using the paths of the centres of the re-entrant waves, called tip trajectories, and dominant frequency maps.\n\nResultsExtracellular potassium elevated the resting potential and IKATP reduced the action potentials duration. In the absence of ischemic zones, the propensity of the model to induce multiple re-entrant waves was low. The inclusion of ischemic zones provided the substrate for initiation of re-entrant wave fibrillation. The dominant frequency which measured the highest rate of pacing in the tissue increased drastically with the inclusion of ischemic zones, going from 3 Hz in the pre-dialysis state to over 6 Hz in the post-dialysis state. Re-entrant wave tip numbers increased from 1 tip in the pre-dialysis case to 34 in the post-dialysis case, a 34 fold increase. The increase of tip number was found to be strongly correlated to tissue heterogeneity in terms of ischemic zone numbers. Computational factors limiting a more extensive simulation of cause-effect combinations were identified.\n\nConclusionsA dialysis session restores systemic homeostasis, but promotes deleterious arrhythmias. Structure-function mechanistic modelling will permit patient-specific assessment of health status. Such an effort is expected to lead to application of wider physical sciences methods in the improvement of the lives of critically ill patients. High performance computing is a crucial requirement for such mechanistic assessment of health status.","NA"

Homogenizing aphids in Eppendorf tube could grind tissues thoroughly and released uncharacterized compounds that could inhibit aphid and pig liver P450 activities, whereas aphids in the microplate likely could not be thoroughly ground and thus released fewer such inhibitors.

Here, we formally test this hypothesis by examining the role of PopZ in ClpXP activity and find surprisingly that CtrA degradation is enhanced in cells lacking polar localization due to loss of PopZ. The ClpXP adaptor CpdR is required for this enhanced degradation of CtrA and other adaptor-dependent substrates, but adaptor-independent substrate degradation is not affected upon loss of PopZ. We find that overexpression of PopZ also leads to faster degradation of CtrA, but is likely due to nonphysiologically relevant recognition of CtrA by ClpXP alone as loss of CpdR does not affect this enhancement. Our main conclusion is that loss of PopZ, and therefore loss of polar localization, does not result in the loss of ClpXP regulated proteolysis, as would be predicted from a model which requires polar localization of ClpXP for its activation. Rather, our data point to a model where PopZ normally restrains ClpXP proteolysis by promoting the inactivation of the CpdR adaptor, likely through the phosphorylation activity of the CckA kinase.","10.1128/jb.00221-18"

The M83 transgenic mouse is a model of synucleinopathy, which develops severe motor symptoms associated with aggregation of -syn. M83 neonate or adult mice were injected with adeno-associated virus vectors carrying the human {beta}-syn gene (AAV{beta}-syn) or green fluorescent protein gene (AAVGFP) using different injection sites. One or two months later, M83 disease was accelerated or not using brain M83 extracts from mouse (M83) or human (MSA) origins. AAV mediated {beta}-syn overexpression detected by ELISA did not delay the disease onset, regardless of the AAV injection route and of the inoculation of brain extracts. Accordingly, phosphorylated -syn levels detected by ELISA in sick mice were similar after injecting AAV{beta}-syn or AAVGFP. Instead, immunohistochemistry analysis of {beta}-syn indicated the presence of proteinase-K resistant {beta}-syn staining specifically in sick M83 mice inoculated with AAV{beta}-syn. This study indicated for the first time that {beta}-syn could form aggregates in a model of synucleinopathy when it is expressed by a viral vector.","10.1038/s41598-018-35825-2"

Interventions that halt the spreading glutamatergic over-activity in this region and thereby the development of overt schizophrenia could be promising therapies. However, animal models with high construct validity to support such pre-clinical development are scarce. The Cyclin-D2 knockout (CD2-KO) mouse model shows a hippocampal Parvalbumin-interneuron dysfunction and its pattern of hippocampal over-activity shares similarities with that seen in prodromal patients. In a comprehensive phenotyping of CD2-KO mice, we found that they displayed novelty-induced hyperlocomotion (a correlate in the positive symptom domain), that was largely resistant against D1- and D2-dopamine receptor antagonism, but responsive to the mGluR2/3-agonist LY379268. In the negative symptom domain, CD2-KO mice showed transiently reduced sucrose-preference (anhedonia), but enhanced interaction with novel mice and objects, as well as normal nest building and incentive motivation. Also, unconditioned anxiety, perseveration, and motor impulsivity were unaltered. However, in the cognitive domain, CD2-knockouts showed reduced executive function in assays of rule-shift and rule-reversal learning, but also an impairment in working memory, that was resistant against LY379268. In contrast, sustained attention and forms of spatial and object-related memory that are mediated by short-term habituation of stimulus-specific attention were intact. Our results suggest, that CD2-KO mice are a valuable model in translational research targeted at the pharmacoresistant cognitive symptom domain in causal relation to hippocampal over-activity in the prodrome-to-psychosis transition.","10.1038/s41398-018-0268-6"

Extreme mutational heterogeneity was evident in a subset of patients whose tumors showed increased APOBEC-signature mutations and expression of APOBEC3 region transcripts compared to patients with lesser mutational heterogeneity. TP53 mutation status was associated with APOBEC hypermutators in our cohort and in three independent LUAD datasets. In a thymic carcinoma patient, extreme heterogeneity and increased APOBEC3AB expression was associated with a high-risk germline APOBEC3AB variant allele. Patients with CNA occurring late in tumor evolution had corresponding changes in gene expression and protein abundance indicating genomic instability as a mechanism of downstream transcriptomic and proteomic heterogeneity between metastases. Across all tumors, proteomic heterogeneity was greater than copy number and transcriptomic heterogeneity. Enrichment of interferon pathways was evident both in the transcriptome and proteome of the tumors enriched for APOBEC mutagenesis despite a heterogeneous immune microenvironment across metastases suggesting a role for the immune microenvironment in the expression of APOBEC transcripts and generation of mutational heterogeneity.

Activation of specific pathways facilitates the cells to overcome cellular damage and thereby warrant integrity. Here we demonstrate the pliability of the CckA-CtrA two component signaling system in the freshwater bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus. Our forward genetic screen to analyse suppressor mutations that can negate the chromosome segregation block induced by the topoisomerase IV inhibitor, NstA, yielded various point mutations in the cell cycle histidine kinase, CckA. Notably, we identified a point mutation in the PAS-B domain of CckA, which resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated CtrA (CtrA[~]P), the master cell cycle regulator. Surprisingly, this increase in CtrA[~]P levels did not translate into a genome-wide increase in the DNA occupancy of CtrA, but specifically enriched its affinity to the chromosomal origin of replication, Cori, and a very small sub-set of CtrA regulated promoters. We show that through this enhanced binding of CtrA to the Cori, cells are able to overcome the toxic defects rendered by stable NstA through a possible slow down in the chromosome cycle. Taken together, our work opens up an unexplored and intriguing aspect of the CckA-CtrA signal transduction pathway. The distinctive DNA binding nature of CtrA and its regulation by CckA might also be crucial for pathogenesis because of the highly conserved nature of CckA-CtrA pathway in alphaproteobacteria.","NA"

Specifically, mHi-C increased the sequencing depth by an average of 20% leading to higher reproducibility of contact matrices and larger number of significant interactions across biological replicates. The impact of the multi-reads on the identification of novel significant interactions is influenced marginally by relative contribution of multi-reads to the sequencing depth compared to uni-reads, cis-to-trans ratio of contacts, and the broad data quality as reflected by the proportion of mappable reads of datasets. Computational experiments highlighted that in Hi-C studies with short read lengths, mHi-C rescued multi-reads can emulate the effect of longer reads. mHi-C also revealed biologically supported bona fide promoter-enhancer interactions and topologically associating domains involving repetitive genomic regions, thereby unlocking a previously masked portion of the genome for conformation capture studies.","NA"

In [1], Sivak et al. introduced a convenient approach to approximating a natural measure of error between the sampled density and the target equilibrium density, the KL divergence, in phase space, but did not specifically address the issue of configuration-space properties, which are much more commonly of interest in molecular simulations. Here, we introduce a variant of this near-equilibrium estimator capable of measuring the error in the configuration-space marginal density, validating it against a complex but exact nested Monte Carlo estimator to show that it reproduces the KL divergence with high fidelity. To illustrate its utility, we employ this new near-equilibrium estimator to assess a claim that a recently proposed Langevin integrator introduces extremely small configuration-space density errors up to the stability limit at no extra computational expense. Finally, we show how this approach to quantifying sampling bias can be applied to a wide variety of stochastic integrators by following a straightforward procedure to compute the appropriate shadow work, and describe how it can be extended to quantify the error in arbitrary marginal or conditional distributions of interest.","10.3390/e20050318"

A.","Matthew Alan Benton","University of Cologne","2018-04-15",2,"2","new results","developmental biology","In Drosophila melanogaster, the germband forms directly on the egg surface and solely consists of embryonic tissue. In contrast, most insect embryos undergo a complicated set of tissue rearrangements to generate a condensed, multi-layered germband. The ventral side of the germband is embryonic, while the dorsal side is thought to be an extraembryonic tissue called the amnion. While this tissue organisation has been accepted for decades, and has been widely reported in insects, its accuracy has not been directly tested in any species. Using live cell tracking and differential cell labelling in the short germ beetle Tribolium castaneum, I show that most of the cells previously thought to be amnion actually give rise to large parts of the embryo. This process occurs via the dorsal-to-ventral flow of cells and contributes to germband extension. In addition, I show that true  amnion cells in Tribolium originate from a small region of the blastoderm. Together, my findings show that development in the short germ embryos of Tribolium and the long germ embryos of Drosophila is more similar than previously proposed. Dorsal-to-ventral cell flow also occurs in Drosophila during germband extension, and I argue that the flow is driven by a conserved set of underlying morphogenetic events in both species. Furthermore, the revised Tribolium fatemap that I present is far more similar to that of Drosophila than the classic Tribolium fatemap. Lastly, my findings show that there is no qualitative difference between the tissue structure of the cellularised blastoderm and the short/intermediate germ germband. As such, the same tissue patterning mechanisms could function continuously throughout the cellularised blastoderm and germband stages, and easily shift between them over evolutionary time.\n\nAuthor summaryIn many animals, certain groups of cells in the embryo do not directly contribute to adult structures. Instead, these cells generate so-called  extra-embryonic tissues that support and facilitate development, but degenerate prior to birth/hatching. In most insect species, embryos are described as having two major extra-embryonic tissues; the serosa, which encapsulates the entire embryo and yolk, and the amnion, which covers one side of the embryo. This tissue structure has been widely reported for over a century, but detailed studies on the amnion are lacking. Working in the beetle Tribolium castaneum, I used long-term fluorescent live imaging, cell tracking and differential cell labelling to investigate amnion development. In contrast to our current understanding, I show that most cells previously thought to be amnion actually form large parts of the embryo. In addition, I show how these cells  flow as a whole tissue and contribute to elongation of the embryo, and how only a relatively small number of cells form the actual amnion. Lastly, I describe how my findings show that despite exhibiting substantial differences in overall structure, embryos of Tribolium and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, utilise a conserved set of morphogenetic processes.","10.1371/journal.pbio.2005093"

Tissue acidosis, resulting from hypoxia or hypercapnia, can activate various proteins and ion channels, among which acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) a family of primarily Na+ permeable ion channels, which alongside classical excitotoxicity causes neuronal death. Naked mole-rats (NMRs, Heterocephalus glaber) are long-lived, fossorial, eusocial rodents that display remarkable behavioral/cellular hypoxia and hypercapnia resistance. In the central nervous system, ASIC subunit expression is similar between mouse and NMR with the exception of much lower expression of ASIC4 throughout the NMR brain. However, ASIC function and neuronal sensitivity to sustained acidosis has not been examined in the NMR brain. Here, we show with whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of cultured NMR and mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons that NMR neurons have smaller voltage-gated Na+ channel currents and more hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials. We further demonstrate that acid-mediated currents in NMR neurons are of smaller magnitude than in mouse, and that all currents in both species are fully blocked by the ASIC antagonist benzamil. We further demonstrate that NMR neurons show greater resistance to acid-induced cell death than mouse neurons. In summary, NMR neurons show significant cellular resistance to acidotoxicity compared to mouse neurons, contributing factors likely to be smaller ASIC-mediated currents and reduced NaV activity.\n\nAbbreviationsASIC, acid-sensing ion channel; CNS, central nervous system; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; NaV, voltage-gated Na+ channel; NMR, naked mole-rat; TTX, tetrodotoxin","10.1186/s13041-018-0369-4"

Our technique visualizes annotated patterns too small to be identifiable at certain zoom levels using insets, i.e., magnified thumbnail views of the annotated patterns. Insets support users in searching, comparing, and contextualizing patterns while reducing the amount of navigation needed. They are dynamically placed either within the viewport or along the boundary of the viewport to offer a compromise between locality and context preservation. Annotated patterns are interactively clustered by location and type. They are visually represented as an aggregated inset to provide scalable exploration within a single viewport.

This issue is expected to be especially important for Cyanobacteria because axenic strains are notoriously difficult to obtain and keep in culture. Yet, despite their great scientific interest, no data are currently available concerning the quality of publicly available cyanobacterial genomes.\n\nRESULTSAs reliably detecting contaminants is a complex task, we designed a pipeline combining six methods in a consensus strategy to assess the contamination level of 440 genome assemblies of Cyanobacteria. Two methods are based on published reference databases of ribosomal genes (SSU rRNA 16S and ribosomal proteins), one is indirectly based on a reference database of marker genes (CheckM), and three are based on complete genome analysis. Among those genome-wide methods, Kraken and DIAMOND blastx share the same reference database that we derived from Ensembl Bacteria, whereas CONCOCT does not require any reference database, instead relying on differences in DNA tetramer frequencies. Given that all the six methods appear to have their own strengths and limitations, we used the consensus of their rankings to infer that >5% of cyanobacterial genome assemblies are highly contaminated by foreign DNA (i.e., contaminants were detected by 5 or 6 methods).\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur results will help researchers to check the quality of publicly available genomic data before use in their own analyses.

Here, we provide functional characterisation of insect SNMPs through the use of bioinformatics, genome curation, transcriptome data analysis, phylogeny, expression profiling, and RNAi gene knockdown techniques. We curated 81 genes from 35 insect species and identified a novel lepidopteran SNMP gene family, SNMP3. Phylogenetic analysis shows that lepidopteran SNMP3, but not the previously annotated lepidopteran SNMP2, is the true homologue of the dipteran SNMP2. Digital expression, microarray and qPCR analyses show that the lepidopteran SNMP1 is specifically expressed in adult antennae. SNMP2 is widely expressed in multiple tissues while SNMP3 is specifically expressed in the larval midgut. Microarray analysis suggest SNMP3 may be involved in the silkworm immunity response to virus and bacterial infections. We functionally characterised SNMP1 in the silkworm using RNAi and behavioural assays. Our results suggested that Bombyx mori SNMP1 is a functional orthologue of the Drosophila melanogaster SNMP1 and plays a critical role in pheromone detection. Split-ubiquitin yeast hybridization study shows that BmorSNMP1 has a protein-protein interaction with the BmorOR1 pheromone receptor, and the BmorOrco co-receptor. Concluding, we propose a novel molecular model in which BmorOrco, BmorSNMP1 and BmorOR1 form a heteromer in the detection of the silkworm sex pheromone bombykol.","NA"

K.; Shiv, B.; Zaki, J.","Brent L Hughes","University of California, Riverside","2018-04-15",1,"15","new results","neuroscience","Human beings revel in social approval and social connection. For example, individuals want to be liked, and frequently surround themselves with people who provide such positive reinforcement. Past work highlights a \""common currency\"" between social rewards like social approval, and non-social rewards like money. But social and motivational contexts can reshape reward experiences considerably. Here, we examine the boundary conditions that deem social approval subjectively valuable. Participants received feedback about their attractiveness from others. Neural activity in reward-related brain structures (e.g., ventral striatum) increased in response to positive feedback, but only when such feedback came from well-liked targets. These heightened reward responses predicted increases in subsequent attraction to well-liked targets. This work suggests that motivational contexts amplify or diminish the value of social approval in a target-specific manner. The value of social approval is thus defined by the extent to which these experiences bring us closer to people we like.","NA"

Visual RFs measured invasively by electrophysiology in animal models have traditionally provided a great extent of our current knowledge about the visual brain and its disorders. Voxel based estimates of population RF (pRF) by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans revolutionized the field and have been used extensively in numerous studies. However, current methods cannot estimate single-neuron RF sizes as they reflect large populations of neurons with individual RF scatter. Here, we introduce a new approach to estimate RF size using spatial frequency selectivity to checkerboard patterns. This method allowed us to obtain non-invasive, single-unit, RF estimates in human V1 for the first time. These estimates were significantly smaller compared to prior pRF methods. Further, fMRI and electrophysiological experiments in non-human primates demonstrated an exceptional match validating the approach.","NA"

Bacterial backbone sequences like antibiotic resistance markers or regulatory bacterial elements constitute biological safety risks and reduce the overall efficiency of the DNA agent. To overcome these problems the minicircle technology has been developed. But, despite all the obvious advantages, minicircles have so far not replaced their problem laden conventional counterpart in gene transfer applications what can be contributed to efficiency issues in large scale manufacturing. In this article we describe the combined efforts of experts in the field of minicircle development, large scale biomanufacturing and downstream process development to provide a new approach. The Recombination Based Plasmid Separation (RBPS) Technology, which has already solved crucial problems associated with minicircle-DNA production, has been developed further for this purpose. A novel parental plasmid exploiting advanced in vivo process coordination for restriction and subsequent degradation of miniplasmid-DNA will be introduced. Furthermore we describe the scale-up of minicircle-DNA production by fermentation in combination with high performance downstream processes including purification by ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography on monolithic material.","NA"

L.; Timp, W.","Winston Timp","Johns Hopkins University","2018-04-15",1,"1","new results","genomics","Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) is a gram negative, obligate anaerobe member of the gut microbial community in up to 40% of healthy individuals. This bacterium is found more frequently in people with colorectal cancer (CRC) and causes tumor formation in the distal colon of mice heterozygous for the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (Apc+/-); tumor formation is dependent on ETBF-secreted Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT). Though some of the immediate downstream effects of BFT on colon epithelial cells (CECs) are known, we still do not understand how this potent exotoxin causes changes in CECs that lead to tumor formation and growth. Because of the extensive data connecting alterations in the epigenome with tumor formation, initial experiments attempting to connect BFT-induced tumor formation with methylation in CECs have been performed, but the effect of BFT on other epigenetic processes, such as chromatin structure, remains unexplored. Here, the changes in chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and gene expression (RNA-seq) induced by treatment of HT29/C1 cells with BFT for 24 and 48 hours is examined. Our data show that several genes are differentially expressed after BFT treatment and these changes correlate with changes in chromatin accessibility. Also, sites of increased chromatin accessibility are associated with a lower frequency of common single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in CRC and with a higher frequency of common differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in CRC. These data provide insight into the mechanisms by which BFT induces tumor formation. Further understanding of how BFT impacts nuclear structure and function in vivo is needed.\n\nImportanceColorectal cancer (CRC) is a major public health concern; there were approximately 135,430 new cases in 2017, and CRC is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both men and women in the US (1). Many factors have been linked to CRC development, the most recent of which is the gut microbiome. Pre-clinical models support that enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), among other bacteria, induce colon carcinogenesis. However, it remains unclear if the virulence determinants of any pro-carcinogenic colon bacterium induce DNA mutations or changes that initiate clonal CEC expansion. Using a reductionist model, we demonstrate that BFT rapidly alters chromatin structure and function consistent with capacity to contribute to CRC pathogenesis.","10.1128/IAI.00447-18"

Similar mass stranding events occurred in 1967 and 2011, yet analysis of these epizootics was incomplete and no etiology was confirmed. Our investigation of the most recent epizootic revealed severe meningoencephalitis in stranded sharks, raising suspicion for infection. On this basis, we pursued a strategy for unbiased pathogen detection using metagenomic next-generation sequencing followed by orthogonal validation and further screening. We show that the ciliated protozoan pathogen, Miamiensis avidus, was present in the central nervous system of leopard (n=12) and other shark species (n=2) that stranded in San Francisco Bay, but absent in leopard sharks caught elsewhere. Whereas this protozoan has previously been implicated in devastating outbreaks in teleost marine fish, our findings represent the first report of a ciliated protozoan infection in wild elasmobranchs. This discovery highlights the benefits of adopting unbiased metagenomic sequencing in the study of wildlife health and disease.","10.7589/2018-04-097"

Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography from humans as they navigated a virtual desert island riven by shifting lava flows. The task probed their ability to take efficient detours and shortcuts to remembered goals. We report modulation in event-related fields and theta power as participants identified real shortcuts and differentiated these from false shortcuts that led along suboptimal paths. Additionally, we found that a decrease in alpha power preceded  back-tracking where participants spontaneously turned back along a previous path. These findings help advance our understanding of the fine-grained temporal dynamics of human brain activity during navigation and support the development of models of brain networks that support navigation.","NA"

Moreover, while humans exhibit highly complex social behaviors, octopuses are thought to be largely asocial and solitary. Despite these differences, growing evidence suggests that ancient neurotransmitter systems are shared across vertebrate and invertebrate species, and in many cases enable overlapping functions. Here we provide evidence that, as in humans, the atypical amphetamine derivative (+/-)-3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) enhances acute prosocial behaviors in Octopus bimaculoides. This finding is paralleled by the evolutionary conservation of the serotonin transporter (SERT, encoded by the Slc6A4 gene) binding site of MDMA in the O. bimaculoides genome. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the neural mechanisms subserving social behaviors exist in O. bimaculoides, and indicate that the role of serotonergic neurotransmission in regulating social behaviors is evolutionarily conserved.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYHere we provide evidence that the atypical amphetamine derivative (+/-)-3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) increases acute social approach behaviors in Octopus bimaculoides, a finding that is paralleled by the evolutionary conservation of the SLC6A4 binding site of MDMA.","NA"

In this work we investigate the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) component of the genomes of these two wild wheat relatives. Sixty-eight RNA-seq libraries generated from several organs and conditions were retrieved from public databases. We annotated and characterized 14,515 T. urartu and 20,908 Ae. tauschii bona-fide lncRNA transcripts that show features similar to those of other plant and animal counterparts. Thousands of lncRNAs were found significantly modulated in different organs and exhibited organ specific expression, with a predominant accumulation in the spike, fostering the hypothesis of their crucial role in reproductive organs. Most of the organ-specific lncRNAs were found associated with transposable elements (TEs), indicating the possible role of TEs in lncRNA origin, differentiation and function. The majority of T. urartu and Ae. tauschii lncRNAs appear to be species-specific; nevertheless, we found some lncRNAs conserved between the two wheat progenitors, highlighting the presence and conservation of exonic splicing enhancers sites in multi-exon conserved lncRNAs. In addition, we found cases of lncRNA conservation and their cis regulatory regions spanning the wheat pre-domestication and post-domestication period. Altogether, these results represent the first comprehensive genome-wide encyclopedia of lncRNAs in wild wheat relatives, and they provide clues as to the hidden regulatory pathway mediated by long noncoding RNAs in these largely unexplored wheat progenitors.","NA"

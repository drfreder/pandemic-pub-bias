To the best of our knowledge, other indexing methods have so far been unable to record abundances efficiently across large datasets.

ResultsWe used REINDEER to index the abundances of sequences within 2,585 human RNA-seq experiments in 45 hours using only 56 GB of RAM. This makes REINDEER the first method able to record abundances at the scale of 4 billion distinct k-mers across 2,585 datasets. REINDEER also supports exact presence/absence queries of k-mers. Briefly, REINDEER constructs the compacted de Bruijn graph (DBG) of each dataset, then conceptually merges those DBGs into a single global one. Then, REINDEER constructs and indexes monotigs, which in a nutshell are groups of k-mers of similar abundances.

Here, in low-dose irradiated murine tumors, we identified CD4+ T cells, M1 macrophages, and NKG2DLow NK cells as cGAMP responder cells that have decreased STING activation upon depletion of extracellular cGAMP. At higher doses of radiation, extracellular cGAMP promoted the death of T cells and macrophages. Furthermore, we identified the orphan protein SLC46A2 as the dominant importer of cGAMP and select bacterial CDNs in human macrophages and monocytes. Together, we provide the first cellular and molecular mechanisms of cGAMP as an immunotransmitter, paving the way for effective STING pathway therapeutics.","NA"

A close association between a mother centriole and a procentriole (engagement), established during centriole duplication, intrinsically blocks reduplication. Premature loss of centriole association predisposes centrioles for reduplication and occurs during various types of cell cycle arrests in the presence of high Polo-like kinase 1 activity. Here we use nano-scale imaging and biochemistry to reveal the processes leading to the loss of centriole association and reduplication. We discover that centriole reduplication is driven by events occurring on procentriole microtubule walls. These events are mechanistically different from mitotic centriole separation driven by Pericentrin and Separase but are similar to the physiological process of centriole distancing occurring in unperturbed cycling G2 cells. We propose a concept in which centriole reduplication is a consequence of hijacked and amplified centriole maturation process.

While HIF activation is transiently protective for all cells, prolonged HIF activity drives distinct pathological responses in different tissues. How HIF achieves this pleiotropic effect is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that non-canonical targets of HIF1a impair the function of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to generate oligodendrocytes. Beyond the canonical gene targets shared between all cell types, HIF1a also bound to and activated a unique set of targets in OPCs including Ascl2 and Dlx3. Each of these targets, when ectopically expressed, was sufficient to block oligodendrocyte development through suppression of the key oligodendrocyte regulator Sox10. Chemical screening revealed that inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling overcame the HIF1a-mediated block in oligodendrocyte generation by restoring Sox10 expression without impacting canonical HIF1a activity. Collectively this work defines the mechanism by which chronic HIF1a suppresses oligodendrocyte formation. More broadly, we establish that cell-type-specific HIF1a targets, independent of the canonical hypoxia response, perturb cell function and drive disease in chronic hypoxia.","NA"

Because sexual reproduction is typically less common than parthenogenesis in populations of the planktonic cladoceran Daphnia magna, it is not frequently studied. Here we examine the sexual process of D. magna and its relation to sexual selection in Daphnia rockpool populations by observing natural mating in these shallow habitats where sex generally occurs throughout the summer. Although microsatellite markers were found to reveal no evidence of disassortative mating or, thus, of inbreeding avoidance, body length and infection status did reveal assortative mating, suggesting sexual selection to act. When two males mated with a single female, the larger male was observed to remain longer, possibly giving it an advantage in sperm competition. Indirect evidence points at the brood pouch as the likely site of fertilization and thus, sperm competition. Sperm length was as variable within ejaculates as it was among males from different populations. Our data provide firm evidence that sexual selection is present in this species, most likely manifesting itself through a combination of female choice and male-male competition.","NA"

In addition to blocking a target molecule, some isotypes of antibodies can activate complement, NK cells or phagocytes, resulting in death of the cell expressing the antibodys target. Human anti-PD-1 therapeutics use antibody isotypes designed to minimize such antibody-dependent lysis. In contrast, anti-PD-1 reagents used in mice are derived from multiple species, with different isotypes, and are not engineered to reduce target cell death: few studies analyze or discuss how antibody species and isotype may impact data interpretation. We demonstrate here that anti-PD-1 therapy to promote activation and proliferation of PD-1-expressing CD8 T cells sometimes led instead to a loss of antigen specific cells. This phenomenon was seen in two tumor models and a model of virus infection, and was varied with the clone of anti-PD-1 antibody. Additionally, we compared competition among anti-PD-1 clones to find a combination that allows detection of PD-1-expressing cells despite the presence of blocking anti-PD1 antibodies in vivo. These data bring attention to the possibility of unintended target cell depletion with some commonly used anti-mouse PD-1 clones, and should provide a valuable resource for the design and interpretation of anti-PD-1 studies in mice.

Although little is known about this Lachnospiraceae family member, its increased abundance has been reported in patients who recovered intestinal homeostasis after dysbiosis events. In this context, the aim of this work was taken advantage of a culturomics protocol that allowed the recovery species extremely oxygen-sensitive from faecal samples, which led to the establishment of an S. intestinalis isolate. Whole genome sequencing and taxonomic allocation confirmation were the base to develop comparative analyses including 11 public genomes closely related. Phylogeographic analysis revealed the existence of three lineages (linage-I including isolates from Chile and France, linage-II from South Korea and Finland, and linage-III from China and one isolate from USA). Pangenome analysis on the established dataset revealed that although S. intestinalis seems to have a highly conserved genome (with 50.1% of its coding potential being part of the coregenome), some recombination signals were evidenced. The identification of cluster of orthologous groups revealed a high number of genes involved in metabolism, including amino acid and carbohydrate transport as well as energy production and conversion, which matches with the metabolic profile previously reported for healthy microbiota. Additionally, virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance genes were found (mainly in linage-III), which could favour their survival during antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. These findings provide the basis of knowledge about this species with potential as a bioindicator of intestinal homeostasis recovery and contribute to advance in the characterization of gut microbiota members with beneficial potential.","NA"

One consequence of Toxoplasma parasitism is increased migratory activity of host cells, which facilitates dissemination. Here we show that Toxoplasma triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) in host cells through calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We further found that host IRE1, an ER stress sensor protein activated during Toxoplasma infection, also plays a noncanonical role in actin remodeling by binding filamin A in infected cells. By inducing cytoskeletal remodeling via IRE1 oligomerization in host cells, Toxoplasma enhances host cell migration in vitro and dissemination of the parasite to host organs in vivo. Our study identifies novel mechanisms used by Toxoplasma to induce dissemination of infected cells, providing new insights into strategies for treatment of toxoplasmosis.

ImportanceCells that are infected with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii exhibit heightened migratory activity, which facilitates dissemination of the infection throughout the body. In this study, we identify a new mechanism used by Toxoplasma to hijack its host cell and increase its mobility. We further show that the ability of Toxoplasma to increase host cell migration does not involve the enzymatic activity of IRE1, but rather IRE1 engagement with actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Depletion of IRE1 from infected host cells reduces their migration in vitro and significantly hinders dissemination of Toxoplasma in vivo. Our findings reveal a new mechanism underlying host-pathogen interactions, demonstrating how host cells are co-opted to spread a persistent infection around the body.","NA"

Whereas adhesion and biofilm capacity of V. parvula is expected to be crucial for its maintenance and development in these environments, studies of V. parvula adhesion have been hindered by the lack of efficient genetic tools to perform functional analyses in this bacterium.

We show that type V secreted autotransporters -typically found in diderm bacteria-are the main determinants of V. parvula auto-aggregation and biofilm formation, which compete with each other for binding either to cells or to surfaces, with strong consequences on V. parvula biofilm formation capacity. We also show that inactivation of the gene coding for a poorly characterized metal-dependent phosphohydrolase HD domain protein conserved in the Firmicutes and their closely related diderm phyla inhibits autotransporter-mediated biofilm formation.

However, the signals and regulatory pathways controlling cell shape transitions in V. cholerae and the benefits of switching between rod and curved shape have not been determined. We demonstrate that cell shape in V. cholerae is regulated by the bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) by repressing expression of crvA, a gene encoding an intermediate filament-like protein necessary for curvature formation in V. cholerae. This regulation is mediated by the transcriptional cascade that also induces production of biofilm matrix components, indicating that cell shape is coregulated with V. choleraes induction of sessility. Wild-type V. cholerae cells adhering to a surface lose their characteristic curved shape to become as straight as cells lacking crvA while genetically engineering cells to maintain high curvature reduced microcolony formation and biofilm density. Conversely, straight V. cholerae mutants have reduced speed when swimming using flagellar motility in liquid. Our results demonstrate regulation of cell shape in bacteria is a mechanism to increase fitness in planktonic or biofilm lifestyles.","NA"

In this study, we investigated the existence and properties of endogenous default options in a task involving choices between risky lotteries. By manipulating and examining the effects of three experimental features - time pressure, time spent on task and relative choice proportion towards a specific option -, we reveal and dissociate two features of endogenous default options which bias individuals' choices: a natural tendency to prefer certain types of options (natural default), and the tendency to implicitly learn a default option from past choices (learned default). Additional analyses suggest that while the natural default may bias the standard choice process towards an option category, the learned default effects may be attributable to a second independent choice process. Overall, these investigations provide a first experimental evidence of how individuals build and apply diverse endogenous default options in economic decision-making and how this biases their choices.","NA"

We found that differential B-class dimerization was associated with subtle, quantitative differences in stamen shape.

Differential dimerization also affected B-class complex abundance, independent of RNA levels. Thus, differential dimerization may affect protein stability. This reveals an important consequence for evolutionary variability in MADS-box interactions, adding complexity to the evolution of developmental gene networks.

In the simulated bacteria-ciliate system, we find species densities to be surprisingly robust under changed mortality rates and times both species coexist, resulting in stable densities. Confirming a theoretical prediction however, the evolution of anti-predator defence in the bacteria and evolution of predation efficiency in ciliates relax under high mortalities and limited times both partners interact. In contrast, evolutionary trajectories intensify when global mortalities are low, and the predator-prey community has more time for close interaction.

However, causal evidence for this is still sparse. Indeed, lesion studies are potentially confounded by compensatory reorganization mechanisms while brain stimulation studies have produced heterogeneous results when employing transcranial magnetic stimulation. Here we designed a new complementary paradigm using fMRI-guided high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) of the left medial intraparietal sulcus (mIPS) together with regression-based mediation analysis to re-examine the causal role of mIPS in online reach corrections to jumping targets. We obtained two independent measures of stimulation-induced changes in brain activity by modeling current flow in the brain and through EEG recordings before and after HD-tDCS stimulation. Third, to quantify behavioral effects of HD-tDCS we computed movement curvature as a measure of online correction. We demonstrate that both of our measurements of brain activity were consistent with a polarity-specific modulation of the online correction for targets jumping to the contralateral side of the stimulation. Importantly, using a mediation analysis of the relationship between stimulation current and movement curvature suggests that the induced current modifies brain activity, which then leads to the observed behavioral changes. This unique combination of methods and analysis thus provides complementary evidence for the crucial role of the posterior parietal cortex in online error correction, while at the same time setting a new methodological standard with respect to the causal influence of transcranial direct current stimulation.

New & NoteworthyTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an interesting and potentially useful tool for asking causal scientific questions and design clinical treatments. With our unique combination of highly accurate fMRI guided stimulation, current forward modeling, EEG recordings before and after the stimulation and behavioral changes we could unravel the causal structure of tDCS. Our approach naturally deals with the variability of tDCS results, increasing its potential usefulness as a tool for research and clinical applications.","NA"

Recently, Shh signaling components have been found to be expressed at the synaptic level in the postnatal brain, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of synaptic transmission. Using in utero electroporation of constitutively active and dominant-negative forms of the Shh co-receptor smoothened (Smo), we studied the role of Smo signaling in the development and maturation of GABAergic transmission in the somatosensory cortex. Our results show that enhancing Smo activity during development accelerates the shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA in dependence on functional expression of potassium-chloride cotransporter type 2 (KCC2). On the other hand, blocking Smo activity maintains GABA response in a depolarizing state in mature cortical neurons resulting in altered chloride homeostasis and increased seizure susceptibility.

In order to judge if metabolite levels are abnormal, analysis of a large number of reference samples is crucial to correct for variations in metabolite concentrations resulting from factors such as diet, age and gender. However, a large number of controls requires the use of out-of-batch controls, which is hampered by the semi-quantitative nature of untargeted metabolomics data, i.e. technical variations between batches. Methods to merge and accurately normalize data from multiple batches are urgently needed.

Methods & resultsBased on six metrics, we compared existing normalization methods on their ability to reduce batch effects from eight independently processed batches. Many of those showed marginal performances, which motivated us to develop Metchalizer, a normalization method which uses 17 stable isotope-labeled internal standards and a mixed effect model. In addition, we propose a regression model with age- and sex as covariates fitted on control samples obtained from all eight batches. Metchalizer applied on log-transformed data showed the most promising performance on batch effect removal as well as in the detection of 178 known biomarkers across 45 IEM patient samples and performed at least similar to an approach using 15 within-batch controls. Furthermore, our regression model indicates that 10-24% of the considered features showed significant age-dependent variations.

ConclusionsOur comprehensive comparison of normalization methods showed that our Log-Metchalizer approach enables the use out-of-batch controls to establish clinically-relevant reference values for metabolite concentrations. These findings opens possibilities to use large scale out-of-batch control samples in a clinical setting, increasing throughput and detection accuracy.

This mode of forward transport necessitates a mechanism to prevent membrane mixing between ER and the retrograde membrane. TANGO1 has an unusual membrane helix organisation, composed of one membrane-spanning helix (TM) and another that penetrates the inner leaflet (IM). We have reconstituted these membrane helices in model membranes and shown that TM and IM together reduce the flow of lipids at a region of defined shape.

Cell proliferation is regulated by volume, but in 3D clusters it remains unclear how multiple cells interact to control their size. In this study, we propose a mechano-osmotic model to investigate the evolution of volume dynamics within multicellular systems. Volume control depends on an interplay between multiple cellular constituents, including gap junctions, mechanosensitive ion channels, energy consuming ion transporters, and the actomyosin cortex, that coordinate to manipulate cellular osmolarity. In connected cells, mechanical loading is shown to significantly affect how these components cooperate to transport ions, and precise volume control is impacted by the emergence of osmotic pressure gradients between cells. Consequent increases in cellular ion concentrations drive swelling, while a loss of ions impedes the compression resistance of cells. Combining the modeling framework with novel experiments, we identify how gap junctions can amplify spatial variations in cell volume within multicellular spheroids and, further, describe how the process depends on proliferation-induced solid stress. Our model provides new insight into the role of gap junctions in cancer progression and can help guide the development of therapeutics that target inter- and extra-cellular ion transport.","NA"

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is implicated in CC progression. This study aims to clarify the underlying mechanism of lncRNA HAND2-AS1 in CC cellular process.

MethodLncRNA expression in CC tissues and adjacent tissues was analyzed via Gene Expression Omnibus microarray. The levels of HAND2-AS1, microRNA (miR)-21 and ALEX1 in 54 cases of CC tissues, adjacent tissues, CC cell lines and normal breast cells were detected. The malignant biological behaviors of CC cells were detected after overexpressing HAND2-AS1 or inhibiting miR-21 expression. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay and RNA-pull down assay were performed to verify the relationship among HAND2-AS1, miR-21 and ALEX1. The effects of HAND2-AS1 on CC cell growth in vivo were verified by nude mice transplantation experiment.

ResultsHAND2-AS1 was lowly expressed in CC tissues and cells, and HAND2-AS1 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA of miR-21 and enhanced ALEX1 expression and downregulated JAK1/STAT3 pathway to inhibit malignant biological behavior of CC cells. Overexpression of HAND2-AS1 or silencing of miR-21 can inhibit the malignant biological behavior of CC cells. Moreover, overexpression of HAND2-AS1 can inhibit the growth of CC cells in vivo.

ConclusionOur data supported that lncRNA HAND2-AS1 promoted ALEX1 expression through competitively binding to miR-21, thereby inhibiting the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and promoting apoptosis of CC cells.","NA"

Such an encounter leads to the formation of a stable di-ribosome complex, which needs to be resolved by a dedicated machinery. The initial stalling and the subsequent resolution of di-ribosomal complexes requires activity of Makorin and ZNF598 ubiquitin E3 ligases respectively, through ubiquitylation of the eS10 and uS10 sub-units of the ribosome. It is common for the stability of RING E3 ligases to be regulated by an interacting deubiquitylase (DUB), which often opposes auto-ubiquitylation of the E3.

GABAB, however, is unique in its function as an obligate heterodimer in which agonist binding and G protein activation take place on distinct subunits. Here we show structures of heterodimeric and homodimeric full-length GABAB receptors. Complemented by cellular signaling assays and atomistic simulations, the structures reveal an essential role for the GABAB extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) in relaying structural transitions by ordering the linker connecting the extracellular ligand-binding domain to the transmembrane region.

It is known for a long time that SB is driven by glutamatergic neurotransmissions but its underlying mechanism is still unclear. Recent studies show that local glutamate recycle by astrocytes can affect neuronal activities nearby. Since SB is independent of network structure, it is conceivable that the local dynamics might also be the origin of SB in networks. We investigated the effects of local glutamate dynamics on SBs in both cultures developed on multi-electrode array (MEA) systems and a tripartite synapse simulation model. In our experiments, local glutamate recycle dynamics are studied by pharmacologically targeting the astrocytic glutamate transporters (GLT-1), while neuronal firing activities and synaptic glutamate level are simultaneously monitored with MEA and glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR) expressed on surface of astrocytes respectively. We found SBs to be synchronized with glutamate transients and the manipulation of local glutamate dynamics can indeed alter the global properties of the SBs. Detailed simulation of a network with astrocytic glutamate uptake and recycle mechanisms conforming with the experimental observations revealed that astrocytes function as a slow negative feedback for the neuronal activities in the network. With this model, SB can be understood as the alternation between the positive and negative feedback in the neurons and astrocytes in the network respectively. An understanding of this glutamate trafficking dynamics is of general application to explain disordered phenomena in neuronal systems, and therefore can provide new insights into the origin of fatal seizure-like behavior.

SignificanceSynchronous bursting (SB) is a hallmark of neuronal circuits. Contrary to the common belief that the SB is governed mainly by neuron-neuron interactions, this study shows that SBs are orchestrated through a generic neuron-astrocyte tripartite interactions. These interactions, identified as glutamate uptake and recycle processes in astrocytes, control the excitability of neuronal networks and shape the overall SB patterns. Our simulation results suggest that astrocytes traffic more glutamate than neurons and actively regulating glutamate proceedings around synapses. A bipartite synapse is a good approximation of a tripartite synapse provided that astrocyte-dependent glutamate content is taken into account. Our findings provide key insights into the ubiquity of SB and the origin of fatal seizure-like behavior in brain arising from astrocytic malfunction.","NA"

The tubular network transiently appeared and exhibited the capacity to degrade autophagic cargoes. The tubular autolysosomal network was uniquely marked by the autophagic SNARE protein, Syntaxin 17, and its formation depended on both autophagic flux and degradative function, with the exception of the Atg12 and Atg8 ubiquitin-like conjugation systems. Among ATG-deficient mutants, the efficiency of lysosomal tubulation correlated with the phenotypic severity in muscle remodeling. The lumen of the tubular network was continuous and homogeneous across a broad region of the remodeling muscle.

However, the regulation of biofilm development is very complex and can include multiple, highly interconnected signal transduction/response pathways, which are incompletely understood. We demonstrated previously that in the opportunistic, human pathogen P. aeruginosa, the PP2C-like protein phosphatase SiaA and the di-guanylate cyclase SiaD control the formation of macroscopic cellular aggregates, a type of suspended biofilms, in response to surfactant stress. In this study, we demonstrate that the SiaABC proteins represent a signal response pathway that functions through a partner switch mechanism to control biofilm formation. We also demonstrate that SiaABCD functionality is dependent on carbon substrate availability for a variety of substrates, and that upon carbon starvation, SiaB mutants show impaired dispersal, in particular with the primary fermentation product ethanol. This suggests that carbon availability is at least one of the key environmental cues integrated by the SiaABCD system. Further, our biochemical, physiological and crystallographic data reveals that the phosphatase SiaA and its kinase counterpart SiaB balance the phosphorylation status of their target protein SiaC at threonine 68 (T68). Crystallographic analysis of the SiaA-PP2C domain shows that SiaA is present as a dimer. Dynamic modelling of SiaA with SiaC suggested that SiaA interacts strongly with phosphorylated SiaC and dissociates rapidly upon dephosphorylation of SiaC. Further, we show that the known phosphatase inhibitor fumonisin inhibits SiaA mediated phosphatase activity in vitro. In conclusion, the present work improves our understanding of how P. aeuruginosa integrates specific environmental conditions, such as carbon availability and surfactant stress, to regulate cellular aggregation and biofilm formation. With the biochemical and structural characterization of SiaA, initial data on the catalytic inhibition of SiaA, and the interaction between SiaA and SiaC, our study identifies promising targets for the development of biofilm-interference drugs to combat infections of this aggressive opportunistic pathogen.

Author SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that is feared within clinical environments due to its potential to cause life-threatening acute and chronic infections. One cornerstone of its success is the ability to form and disperse from biofilms, which are self-made, multicellular structures that protect the individual cell from the human immune system and antibiotic treatment. As such, therapies that combine a biofilm-interference strategy and the use of antimicrobial drugs represent one of the promising strategies to tackle infections of this organism. With the current study, we gain a deeper understanding of the SiaABCD mediated biofilm formation in response to clinically relevant environmental conditions. Further, our structural and biochemical characterization of the PP2C-type protein-phosphatase SiaA and the partner switch protein SiaC suggest that both represent promising novel targets for the development of future anti-biofilms drugs based on a signal interference strategy.","NA"

Mitotic bookmarking by transcription factors has been proposed as a potential mechanism to ensure the reactivation of transcription at the proper set of genes exiting mitosis. Recently, mitotic transcription and waves of transcription reactivation have been observed in synchronized populations of human hepatoma cells. However, the study did not consider that mitotic-arrested cell populations progressively desynchronize leading to measurements of gene expression on a mixture of cells at different internal cell-cycle times. Moreover, it is not well understood yet what is the precise role of mitotic bookmarking on mitotic transcription as well as on the transcription reactivation waves. Ultimately, the core gene regulatory network driving the precise transcription reactivation dynamics remains to be identified. To address these questions, we developed a mathematical model to correct for the progressive desynchronization of cells and estimate gene expression dynamics with respect to a cell-cycle pseudotime. Furthermore, we used a multiple linear regression model to infer transcription factor activity dynamics. Our analysis allows us to characterize waves of transcription factor activities exiting mitosis and identify a core gene regulatory network responsible of the transcription reactivation dynamics. Moreover, we identified more than 60 transcription factors that are highly active during mitosis and represent new candidates of mitotic bookmarking factors which could represent relevant therapeutic targets to control cell proliferation.","NA"

We assessed the ability to perform meaningful gestures with the hand in 101 patients with chronic left hemisphere stroke. Structural damage to white matter fibres was assessed by diffusion tensor imaging. A support vector regression model predicting apraxia based on individual topographies of tract-based fractional anisotropy was utilised to obtain multivariate topographical inference. We found pathological white matter alterations in a densely connected fronto-temporo-parietal network of short and long association fibres to predict limb apraxia deficits. Major disconnection affected temporo-parietal and temporo-temporal connections. Grey matter areas with a high number of disconnections included inferior parietal lobe, middle and superior temporal gyrus, inferior and middle frontal lobe, precentral gyrus, putamen, and caudate nucleus. These results demonstrate the relevance of frontal and inferior parietal regions in praxis, but they also highlight the temporal lobe and its connections to be an important contributor to the human praxis network.","NA"

However, existing lateral stabilization devices not only constrains lateral motions, but also transverse and frontal pelvis rotations. This study aimed to investigate the effect of external lateral stabilization with and without constrained transverse pelvis rotation on mechanical and metabolic gait features.

MethodsWe undertook 2 experiments with eleven and ten young adult subjects, respectively. Experiment 2 supplemented experiment 1, as it considered several potential confounding factors in the design and set-up of experiment 1. Kinematic, kinetic, and breath-by-breath oxygen consumption data were recorded during 3 walking conditions (normal walking (Normal), lateral stabilization with (Free) and without transverse pelvis rotation (Restricted)) and at 3 speeds (0.83, 1.25, and 1.66 m/s) for each condition.

ResultsExternal lateral stabilization significantly reduced the amplitudes of the transverse and frontal pelvis rotations, medio-lateral pelvis displacement, transverse thorax rotation, arm swing, and step width. The amplitudes of free vertical moment, anterior-posterior and vertical pelvis displacements, step length, and energy cost were not significantly influenced by external lateral stabilization. The removal of transverse pelvis rotation restriction by our experimental set-up resulted in significantly higher transverse pelvis rotation, although it remained significantly less than Normal condition. In concert, concomitant gait features such as transverse thorax rotation and arm swing were not significantly influenced by our new set-up.

ConclusionExisting lateral stabilization set-ups not only constrain medio-lateral motions (i.e. medio-lateral pelvis displacement), but also constrains other movements such as transverse and frontal pelvis rotations, which leads to several other gait changes such as reduced transverse thorax rotation, and arm swing. Our new setup allowed for more transverse pelvis rotation, however, this did not result in more normal pelvis rotation, arm swing, etc. Hence, to provide medio-lateral support without constraining other gait variables, more elaborate set-ups are needed. Unless such a set-up is realized the observed side effects need to be taken into account when interpreting the effects of lateral stabilization as reported in previous studies.","NA"

Next, we incorporated feedback-control to maintain hundreds of remotely monitored bacterial cultures in log-phase growth without user intervention.

The invasion can be morphologically diverse, ranging from that of dispersed mesenchymal cells to multicellular collectives. When cancer cells are cultured within basement membrane-like matrix (BM), or Type 1 collagen, or a combination of both, they show collective-, dispersed mesenchymal-, and hybrid collective-dispersed (multiscale) invasion respectively. Here, we ask how distinct these invasive modes are with respect to the cellular and microenvironmental cues that drive them, and how can cancer cells transition between such states. A rigorous exploration of invasion was performed within an experimentally motivated Cellular Potts-based computational modeling environment. The model comprises of adhesive interactions between cancer cells, BM- and collagen-like extracellular matrix (ECM), and reaction-diffusion-based remodeling of ECM. The model output consisted of metrics cognate to dispersed- and collective-invasion. An exhaustive combination of input values gave rise to a spatial output distribution that comprised dispersed-, collective- and multiscale-invasion. K-means clustering of the output distribution followed by silhouette analysis revealed three optimal clusters: one signifying indolent invasion and two representing multiscale invasions, each of which encompass the purer dispersed- and collective invasions respectively. Principal component analyses of phenotypic outputs close to the separation of these two multiscale modes established specific input signatures: perturbing such signatures revealed the cues that can allow phenotypic transitions among these three clusters. Our systems-level analysis provides quantitative insights into the biases and constraints cancer cells face during their invasion through tissue microenvironments with distinct physicochemical properties.","NA"

However, the forces and constraints governing the evolution of sex-biased genes in the somatic tissues of Drosophila are largely unknown. Using population-scale RNA sequencing data we show that sex-biased genes in the Drosophila brain are highly enriched on the X Chromosome and that most are biased in a species-specific manner. We show that X-linked male-biased genes, and to a lesser extent female-biased genes, are enriched for signatures of directional selection at the gene expression level. By examining the evolutionary properties of gene flanking regions on the X Chromosome, we find evidence that adaptive cis-regulatory changes are more likely to drive the expression evolution of X-linked male-biased genes than other X-linked genes. Finally, we examine whether constraint due to broad expression across multiple tissues and genetic constraint due to the largely shared male and female genomes could be responsible for the observed patterns of gene expression evolution. We find that expression breadth does not constrain the directional evolution of gene expression in the brain. Additionally, we find that the shared genome between males and females imposes a substantial constraint on the expression evolution of sex-biased genes. Overall, these results significantly advance our understanding of the patterns and forces shaping the evolution of sexual dimorphism in the Drosophila brain.","NA"

The primary biochemical consequence of HGD-deficiency is increased circulating homogentisic acid (HGA), which is central to AKU disease pathology. The aim of this study was to investigate the wider metabolic consequences of targeted Hgd disruption.

Experimental Approachthe first metabolomic analysis of the Hgd-/- AKU mouse model was performed. Urinary metabolites altered in Hgd-/- were further validated by showing that the HGA-lowering drug nitisinone reversed their direction of alteration in AKU

Key Resultscomparison of Hgd-/- (AKU) versus Hgd+/- (heterozygous control) urine revealed increases in HGA and a group of 8 previously unreported HGA-derived transformation products from phase I and II metabolism. HGA biotransformation products HGA-sulfate, HGA-glucuronide, HGA-hydrate and hydroxymethyl-HGA were also decreased in urine from both mice and patients with AKU on the HGA-lowering agent nitisinone. Hgd knockout also revealed a host of previously unrecognised associations between tyrosine, purine and TCA cycle metabolic pathways.

Conclusion and ImplicationsAKU is rare, but our findings further what is currently understood about tyrosine metabolism more generally, and show for the first time that phase I and II detoxification is recruited to prevent accumulation of endogenously-produced metabolites in inborn errors of metabolism. The data highlight the misconception that phase I and II metabolic biotransformations are reserved solely for drug clearance; these are ancient mechanisms, which represent new potential treatment targets in inherited metabolic diseases.

We report two previously unknown families of anion channelrhodopsins (ACRs), one from the heterotrophic protists labyrinthulomycetes and the other from haptophyte algae. Four closely related labyrinthulomycete ACRs, named RubyACRs here, exhibit a unique retinal binding pocket that creates spectral sensitivities with maxima at 590-610 nm, the most red-shifted channelrhodopsins known, long-sought for optogenetics, and more broadly the most red-shifted microbial rhodopsins so far reported. We identified three spectral tuning residues critical for the red-shifted absorption. Photocurrents recorded from the RubyACR from Aurantiochytrium limacinum (designated AlACR1) under single-turnover excitation exhibited biphasic decay, the rate of which was only weakly voltage-dependent, in contrast to that in previously characterized cryptophyte ACRs, indicating differences in channel gating mechanisms between the two ACR families. Moreover, in A. limacinum we identified three ACRs with absorption maxima at 485, 545, and 590 nm, indicating color-sensitive photosensing with blue, green and red spectral variation of ACRs within individual species of the labyrinthulomycete family. We also report energy transfer from a cytoplasmic fluorescent protein domain to the retinal chromophore bound within RubyACRs, not seen in similar constructs in other channelrhodopsins.

Significance StatementOur identification and characterization of two ACR families, one from non-photosynthetic microorganisms, shows that light-gated anion conductance is more widely spread among eukaryotic lineages than previously thought. The uniquely far red-shifted absorption spectra of the subset we designate RubyACRs provide the long-sought inhibitory optogenetic tools producing large passive currents activated by long-wavelength light, enabling deep tissue penetration. Previously only low-efficiency ion-pumping rhodopsins were available for neural inhibition by the orange-red region of the spectrum. The unusual amino acid composition of the retinal-binding pocket in RubyACRs expands our understanding of color tuning in retinylidene proteins. Finally, energy transfer from the fluorescent protein used as a tag on RubyACRs opens a potential new dimension in molecular engineering of optogenetic tools.","NA"

While the importance of these cell to neuron interactions are widely acknowledged, they have not been thoroughly characterized. We sought to address this by cataloging how peripheral cell types interact with sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) using RNA sequencing datasets.

Perhaps as a reaction to this inflation, recent critical commentaries unfavorably compare DL with standard machine learning (SML) approaches for the analysis of brain imaging data. Yet, their conclusions are based on pre-engineered features which deprives DL of its main advantage: representation learning. Here we evaluate this and show the importance of representation learning for DL performance on brain imaging data. We report our findings from a large-scale systematic comparison of SML approaches versus DL profiled in a ten-way age and gender-based classification task on 12,314 structural MRI images. Results show that DL methods, if implemented and trained following the prevalent DL practices, have the potential to substantially improve compared to SML approaches. We also show that DL approaches scale particularly well presenting a lower asymptotic complexity in relative computational time, despite being more complex. Our analysis reveals that the performance improvement saturates as the training sample size grows, but shows significantly higher performance throughout. We also show evidence that the superior performance of DL is primarily due to the excellent representation learning capabilities and that SML methods can perform equally well when operating on representations produced by the trained DL models. Finally, we demonstrate that DL embeddings span a comprehensible projection spectrum and that DL consistently localizes discriminative brain biomarkers, providing an example of the robustness of prediction relevance estimates. Our findings highlight the presence of non-linearities in brain imaging data that DL frameworks can exploit to generate superior predictive representations for characterizing the human brain, even with currently available data sizes.","NA"

While the importance of behavior-change for epidemic dynamics is broadly recognized, the approaches to modeling the coupled dynamics of epidemics and behavior change have been limited. An important mode of behavior change in epidemics is a reduction in potentially infectious contacts. We develop a model for endogenous change of the effective contact rate of Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model by positing a dynamic utility function associated with the expected number of contacts people have in the population. This utility function trades off the ideal number of social contacts with the expected cost of becoming infected. Our analysis of this simple, deterministic model reveals the existence of a non-zero endemic equilibrium, oscillatory dynamics under some parametric conditions, and complex dynamic regimes that shift under small parameter perturbations.

The current assessment methods of water use make a meaningful assessment of livestock water use difficult as they are mainly static, thus poorly adaptable to understand future scenarios of water use and requirements. They lack the integration of fundamental ruminant nutrition and growth equations within a dynamic context that accounts for short and long-term behavior and time delays associated with economically important beef producing areas. This study utilized the System Dynamics methodology to conceptualize a water footprint for ruminants within a dynamic and mechanistic modeling framework. The problem of beef cattle livestock water footprint assessment was articulated, and a dynamic hypothesis was formed to represent the Texas livestock water use system as the initial step in developing the Texas Beef Water Footprint model (TXWFB). The fulfillment of the dynamic hypothesis required the development of three causal loop diagrams (CLD): cattle population, growth and nutrition, and the livestock water footprint. The CLD provided a framework that captured the daily water footprint of beef (WFB) of the cow-calf, stocker, and feedlot phases and the entire beef supply chain. Preliminary simulations captured the oscillatory behavior of the Texas cattle population and overshoot and collapse behavior, under conditions when regional livestock water resources became scarce. Sensitivity analysis from the hypothesized CLD structures indicated that forage quality was less of an impact on the daily WFB of each cattle phase compared to the use of high concentrate feeds.

Fifty-eight cognitively-healthy older adults completed cognitive control tasks, structural MRI, and resting state fMRI scans. We estimated inferred, WMH-related disruptions in structural connectivity between pairs of subcortical and cortical regions by overlaying each participants WMH mask on a normative tractogram dataset. For region-pairs in which structural disconnection was associated with cognitive control, we calculated RSFC between nodes in those same regions. WMH-related structural disconnection and RSFC in the cognitive control network and default mode network were both associated with poorer cognitive inhibition. These regionally-specific, WMH-related structural and functional changes were more strongly associated with cognitive inhibition compared to standard rating of WMH burden.

Non-pharmacological therapies have shown some success in adults; however, to appropriately apply these in children we need to understand pediatric migraines underlying biology. One theory is that migraine results from an imbalance in cortical excitability. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies show changes in GABA and glutamate levels (the primary inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, respectively) in multiple brain regions. Although there is indirect evidence of abnormal excitability in pediatric migraine, GABA and glutamate levels have yet to be assessed.

The purpose of this study was to measure levels of GABA and glutamate in the thalamus, sensorimotor cortex and visual cortex of children with migraine using MRS. We found that children with migraine and aura had significantly lower glutamate levels in the visual cortex as compared to control children, opposite to results seen in adults. Additionally, we found significant correlations between metabolite levels and migraine characteristics; higher GABA levels were associated with a higher migraine burden. We also found that higher glutamate in the thalamus and higher GABA/Glx ratios in the sensorimotor cortex were associated with duration since diagnosis, i.e., having migraines longer. Lower GABA levels in the sensorimotor cortex were associated with being closer to their next migraine attack. Together this indicates that GABA and glutamate disturbances occur early in migraine pathophysiology and emphasizes that evidence from adults with migraine cannot be immediately translated to paediatric sufferers. This highlights the need for further mechanistic studies of migraine in children, to aid in the development of more effective treatments.","NA"

Declines in pollinator populations are thought to be due to multiple factors including habitat loss, climate change, increased vulnerability to disease and parasites, and pesticide use. Neonicotinoid pesticides are agonists of insect nicotinic cholinergic receptors, and sub-lethal exposures are linked to reduced honey bee hive survival. Honey bees are highly dependent on circadian clocks to regulate critical behaviors, such as foraging orientation and navigation, time-memory for food sources, sleep, and learning/ memory processes. Because circadian clock neurons in insects receive light input through cholinergic signaling we tested for effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep. Neonicotinoid ingestion by feeding over several days results in neonicotinoid accumulation in the bee brain, disrupts circadian rhythmicity in many individual bees, shifts the timing of behavioral circadian rhythms in bees that remain rhythmic, and impairs sleep. Neonicotinoids and light input act synergistically to disrupt bee circadian behavior, and neonicotinoids directly stimulate wake-promoting clock neurons in the fruit fly brain. Neonicotinoids disrupt honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep, likely by aberrant stimulation of clock neurons, to potentially impair honey bee navigation, time-memory, and social communication.","NA"

Though potent disaggregases, these enhanced Hsp104 variants lack substrate specificity, and can have unfavorable off-target effects. Here, to lessen off-target effects, we engineer substrate-specific Hsp104 variants. By altering Hsp104 pore loops that engage substrate, we disambiguate Hsp104 variants that selectively suppress -synuclein toxicity but not TDP-43 or FUS toxicity. Remarkably, -synuclein-specific Hsp104 variants emerge that mitigate -synuclein toxicity via distinct ATPase-dependent mechanisms, involving -synuclein disaggregation or detoxification of -synuclein conformers without disaggregation. Importantly, both types of -synuclein-specific Hsp104 variant reduce dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a C. elegans model of Parkinsons disease more effectively than non-specific variants.

The evaluation process is complex due to the inherent large human variations in motor recovery and the limitations of commonly used clinical measurement tools. Information recorded during a robot-assisted rehabilitation process can provide an effective means to continuously quantitatively assess movement performance and rehabilitation progress. However, selecting appropriate motion features for rehabilitation evaluation has always been challenging. This paper exploits unsupervised feature learning techniques to reduce the complexity of building the evaluation model of patients progress. A new feature learning technique is developed to select the most significant features from a large amount of kinematic features measured from robotics, providing clinically useful information to health practitioners with reduction of modeling complexity. A novel indicator that can reflect monotonicity and trendability is proposed to evaluate the suitability of kinematic features, which are derived from the collected data of a population of stroke patients participating in robot-aided rehabilitation. The selected kinematic features allow for human variations across a population of patients as well as over the sequence of rehabilitation sessions. The study is based on data records pertaining to 41 stroke patients using three different robot assisted exercises for upper limb rehabilitation. Consistent with the literature, the results indicate that features based on movement smoothness are the best measures among 17 kinematic features used to evaluate rehabilitation progress.","NA"

A detailed analysis of the groups of equivalent SSEs and their variability provides an overview of the studied protein family and can be used to enrich the analysis of a particular protein at hand.

ResultsWe developed a workflow for analysis of the secondary structure anatomy of a protein family, based on SSE annotation tool SecStrAnnotator. We applied this analysis to the model family of cytochromes P450 (CYPs) - a family of important biotransformation enzymes with a community-wide used SSE annotation. We report the occurrence, typical length and amino acid sequence for the equivalent SSE groups, as well as the conservation/variability of these properties. We also suggest a generic residue numbering scheme for the CYP family. The comparison between the bacterial and eukaryotic part of the family highlights the major differences and reveals an anomalous group of bacterial CYPs with some typically eukaryotic features. This hints at possible evolutionary and functional relationships.

Here, the movement of two flocks of domestic homing pigeons (Columba livia) - measured via accelerometry loggers - was recorded over a period of two weeks. Movement was then used to calculate each individuals daily overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA, G), which can be used as a proxy for energy expenditure. The dominance hierarchy of the two flocks was determined via group-level antagonistic interactions, and demonstrated a significantly linear structure. The most dominant bird within each flock was found to move significantly more than conspecifics - on average, c.39% greater than the individual with the next highest degree of movement - indicating a possible cost to possessing the top rank within a hierarchy. Despite the dominance hierarchy being linear, mean daily total ODBA did not reflect a linear nature, with no pattern observed between rank and ODBA, once the top ranked individuals had been accounted for. This suggest that energy expenditure may be more reflective of a despotic hierarchy. These results show the potential for the future use of accelerometery as a tool to study the fusion of energetics and behaviour.

Hence, we present a computational procedure that uses artificial neural networks to accurately localize several macromolecular species in cellular cryo-electron tomograms. The DeepFinder algorithm leverages deep learning and outperforms the commonly-used template matching method on synthetic datasets. Meanwhile, DeepFinder is very fast when compared to template matching, and is better capable of localizing and identifying small macro-molecules than other competitive deep learning methods. On experimental cryo-ET data depicting ribosomes, the localization and structure resolution (determined through subtomogram averaging) results obtained with DeepFinder are consistent with those obtained by experts. The DeepFinder algorithm is able to imitate the analysis performed by experts, and is therefore a very promising algorithm to investigate efficiently the contents of cellular tomograms. Furthermore, we show that DeepFinder can be combined with a template matching procedure to localize the missing macromolecules not found by one or the other method.

It remains unknown how cells synchronize and autorhythmically activate above the intrinsic mean activation frequency of isolated cells without pacemaking mechanisms. Recent insights into ephaptic coupling (non-gap junction or synaptic coupling) suggest that cyclic ion accumulation and depletion in diffusion limited extracellular volumes densely expressing ion channels modifies action potentials. This report explores how potassium accumulation and depletion in a restricted extracellular domain promotes spontaneous oscillations in the Hodgkin Huxley action potential model, which does not spontaneously activate on its own without external stimulus. Simulations demonstrate cells sharing a diffusion limited extracellular compartment can become autorhythmic and synchronous despite intercellular electrical heterogeneity. Autorhythmic frequency can be determined by net potassium flux into the cleft and the cleft volume. Additionally, inexcitable cells can induce autorhythmic activity in an excitable cell via a shared cleft and sufficient potassium fluxes contributed by each cell. Importantly, the synchronization and autorhythmic activity conferred by shared cleft with reduced potassium efflux can occur in the absence of gap junctions. Lastly, not only can potassium oscillations in shared restricted clefts initiate, support, and suppress autorhythmic depolarizations, the same mechanism can homogenize repolarization. The work has implications for understanding how automaticity is coordinated among excitable cells and suggests a new role for non-excitable cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages, or astrocytes with sarcolemmal potassium handling proteins facing shared and restricted intercellular clefts.

SIGNIFICANCEA mechanism of cyclic ion accumulation and depletion in diffusion limited extracellular compartments can suppress, initiate, and support autorhythmic activity. Additionally, autorhythmicity can emerge from electrophysiologically heterogeneous cell pairs sharing a diffusion limited extracellular compartment, even if the individual cells will not spontaneously depolarize on their own. Sustained and synchronous autorhythmic activity can occur in the absence of gap junction coupling. Lastly, the shared diffusion limited extracellular compartment can also reduce action potential duration gradients by synchronizing repolarization.","NA"

Unlike the other candidates, the tumorigenic potential of ARID2, encoding a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is largely unexplored in CRC. shRNA mediated ARID2 knockdown performed in two different CRC cell lines resulted in significant alterations in transcript levels of cancer-related target genes. More importantly, ARID2 knockdown promoted several tumorigenic features including cell viability, proliferation, ability to override contact inhibition of growth, and migration besides significantly increasing tumor formation ability in nude mice. The observed gain in tumorigenic features were rescued upon ectopic expression of ARID2. Analyses of the TCGA CRC dataset revealed poorer survival in patients with ARID2 alterations. We therefore propose ARID2 as a novel tumor suppressor in CRC.","NA"

Although this theory has been applied to co-infecting parasite species, it has almost always been with a single time lag between co-infecting parasites. Thus, how the timing of parasite species arrival affects co-infections and disease remains poorly understood. To address this gap in the literature, we exposed post-metamorphic Cuban tree frogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis) to Ranavirus, the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a nematode Aplectana hamatospicula, or pairs of these parasites either simultaneously or sequentially at a range of time lags and quantified load of the secondary parasite and host growth, survival and parasite tolerance. Prior exposure to Bd or A. hamatospicula significantly increased viral loads relative to hosts singly infected with Ranavirus, whereas A. hamatospicula loads in hosts were higher when co-exposed to Bd than when co-exposed to Ranavirus. There was a significant positive relationship between time since Ranavirus infection and Bd load, and prior exposure to A. hamatospicula decreased Bd loads compared to simultaneous co-infection with these parasites. Infections with Bd and Ranavirus either singly or in co-infections decreased host growth and survival. This research reveals that time lags between co-infections can affect parasite loads, in line with priority effects theory. As co-infections in the field are unlikely to be simultaneous, an understanding of when co-infections are impacted by time lags between parasite exposures may play a major role in controlling problematic co-infections.","NA"

Allometric equation was used in calculating the biomass of oil palm trunk. Furthermore, destructive methods were used to determine the biomass in other oil palm parts (fronds, leaves, and fruits). Carbon stocks from the other carbon pools in the oil palm plantations were measured which includes understory, litterfall, and soil.

Majority of the carbon stock is found in the oil palm plant (53%), followed by soil (38%), litterfall (6%), and understory, (4%). The average carbon sequestration rate of oil palm plants is estimated to be 4.55 tC/ha/year. It is advised that oil palm expansions should be done on grasslands and barren lands instead of forest lands to avoid incurring ""carbon debts"".

The receptor recognizes cells opsonized with the complement fragment iC3b and to a lesser extend C3dg. While the interaction between the iC3b thioester domain and the ligand binding CR3 M I-domain is now structurally well characterized, additional CR3-iC3b interactions lack structural insight. Using an integrated structural biology approach, we analyze the interaction between iC3b and the headpiece fragment of the CR3 ectodomain. Surface plasmon resonance experiments found an affinity of 30 nM of CR3 for iC3b compared to 515 nM for the iC3b thioester domain. The iC3b1 intermediate formed during factor I degradation is shown to be a CR3 headpiece ligand in addition to iC3b and C3dg. Small angle x-ray scattering analysis reveals that in solution the iC3b-CR3 complex is more compact than either of the individual proteins and prior models of the complex derived by electron microscopy. Overall, the data suggest that the iC3b-CR3 complex is structurally ordered and governed by high affinity.

Leveraging a novel analytic approach, prediction correlation, we investigated the causal interactions within and between large-scale networks of the brain using resting-state fMRI. This technique allows us to characterize information transfer between brain regions in both the spatial (direction) and temporal (duration) scales. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (N=200) we applied prediction correlation techniques to four resting state fMRI runs (total TRs = 4800). Three central observations emerged. First, the strongest and longest duration connections were observed within the somatomotor, visual and dorsal attention networks. Second, the short duration connections were observed for high-degree nodes in the visual and default networks, as well as in hippocampus. Specifically, the connectivity profile of the highest-degree nodes was dominated by efferent connections to multiple cortical areas. Moderate high-degree nodes, particularly in hippocampal regions, showed an afferent connectivity profile. Finally, multimodal association nodes in lateral prefrontal brain regions demonstrated a short duration, bidirectional connectivity profile, consistent with this regions role in integrative and modulatory processing. These results provide novel insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain function.","NA"

We show that the eigenmodes of the Maury operator have a direct physical interpretation as the relaxation, or resistive, modes of the network. We apply these findings to both idealised and image-based models of ventilation in lung airway trees and show that the spectral properties of the Maury matrix characterise the flow asymmetry in these networks more concisely than the Laplacian modes, and that eigenvector centrality in the Maury spectrum is closely related to the phenomenon of ventilation heterogeneity caused by airway narrowing or obstruction.

Thus far, DNA metabarcoding has only reliably identified the presence/absence of a plant species in a pollen sample, but not its relative abundance in a mixed sample. Here we use a system of four congeneric, co-flowering plants in the genus Clarkia and their bee pollinators to (1) develop a molecular method to quantify different Clarkia pollens found on foraging bees; and (2) determine if bee pollinators carry Clarkia pollens in predictable ways, based on knowledge of their foraging behaviors. We develop a molecular method we call quantitative amplicon sequencing (qAMPseq) which varies cycling number (20, 25, 30, and 35 cycles) in polymerase chain reaction (PCR), individually indexing the same samples in different cycle treatments, and sequencing the resulting amplicons. These values are used to approximate an amplification curve for each Clarkia species in each sample, similar to the approach of quantitative PCR, which can then be used to estimate the relative abundance of the different Clarkia species in the sample. Using this method, we determine that bee visitation behaviors are generally predictive of the pollens that bees carry while foraging. We also show that some bees carry multiple species of Clarkia at the same time, indicating that Clarkia likely compete via interspecific pollen transfer. In addition to adding a  missing link between bee visitation behavior and actual pollen transfer, we suggest qAMPseq as another molecular method to add to the developing molecular ecology and pollination biology toolbox.","NA"

Leaf insect herbivory decreased with increasing tree diversity, and predator attack rate on artificial larvae increased with tree density around focal trees.

Since the Late Jurassic, six major squamate groups independently evolved multiple-cusped teeth from a single-cusped common ancestor. Unlike mammals10,11, reversals to lower cusp numbers were frequent in squamates, with varied multiple-cusped morphologies in several groups resulting in heterogenous evolutionary rates. Squamate tooth complexity evolved in correlation with dietary change - increased plant consumption typically followed tooth complexity increases, and the major increases in speciation rate in squamate evolutionary history are associated with such changes. The evolution of complex teeth played a critical role in vertebrate evolution outside Mammalia, with squamates exemplifying a more labile system of dental- dietary evolution.","NA"

Females evolving under budding dispersal produced less female-biased offspring sex ratios than those from the random dispersal selection regimes, contradicting theoretical predictions. In turn, the scale of competition did not have a strong effect on sex allocation. Males evolved under budding dispersal induced less female harm than those exposed to random dispersal, but there was no reduction in female fitness following exposure to multiple mates from either selection regime.

This work highlights that population structure can impact the evolution of sex allocation and sexual conflict. We also discuss how selection on either trait may reciprocally affect the evolution of the other, for example via effects on fecundity.","NA"

Pathogenicity tests in fact revealed the pestification of V. inaequalis, with higher virulence of the agricultural-type population on both wild and domesticated trees.

However, the evolutionary characteristics of KRAB domains, C2H2 zinc fingers and the full protein of KZFPs have not been fully analyzed. As for the drivers of the rapid evolution, its partly due to their coevolution with transposable elements (TEs). But their diverse functions besides inhibiting TEs suggest other reasons exist. Here we address these two issues by the systematic analysis of the divergence time and diversification pattern of KZFPs at three aspects and the functional analysis of the potential target genes besides TEs. We found that old-zinc-finger-containing KZFPs tend to have varied and disordered KRAB domains, indicating there are two ways of the evolution of KZFPs, including the variation of KRAB domains and the diversification of zinc fingers. Among them, the divergence of zinc fingers mainly contributes to the rapid evolution of KZFPs. Thus, we mainly focused on the functional requirements of the evolution of zinc fingers. Different from the classical regulation pattern of this family, we found and experimentally confirmed that KZFPs tend to bind to non-TE regions and can positively regulate target genes. Although most young genes tend to be with a low expression level, young-zinc-finger-containing KZFPs tend to be highly expressed in early embryonic development or early mesoderm differentiation, indicating their particular evolutionarily novel functional roles in these two processes. We further validated a young KZFP, ZNF611, can bind to non-TE region of STK38 gene and positively regulates its expression in ESCs. The emergence of new sequence in STK38 promoter may drive the evolution of zinc fingers in ZNF611. Finally, we proposed a  two-way evolution model of KZFP family.","NA"

We found a strong positive correlation between virulence and reproduction, with substantial variation in both traits maintained within each pathogen population. On average, highly virulent isolates exhibited higher fecundity, which might increase transmission potential in agricultural fields planted to homogeneous hosts at a high density. We further showed that pathogen strains with a narrow host range (i.e. specialists) for fecundity were on average less virulent, and those with a broader host range (i.e. generalists) for virulence were on average less fecund on a given specific host. These trade-offs costs associated with host specialization might constrain the directional evolution of virulence and fecundity.

However, trait evolution along discordant gene trees can also generate these incongruences - a phenomenon known as hemiplasy. Classic phylogenetic comparative methods do not account for discordance, resulting in incorrect inferences about the number of times a trait has evolved, and therefore about convergence. Biological sources of discordance include incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and introgression, but only ILS has received theoretical consideration in the context of hemiplasy. Here, we derive expectations for the probabilities of hemiplasy and homoplasy with ILS and introgression acting simultaneously. We find that introgression makes hemiplasy more likely, suggesting that methods that account for discordance due to ILS alone will be conservative. We also present a method for making statistical inferences about the relative probabilities of hemiplasy and homoplasy in empirical datasets. Our method is implemented in the software package HeIST (Hemiplasy Inference Simulation Tool), and estimates the most probable number of transitions among character states given a set of relationships with discordance. HeIST can accommodate ILS and introgression simultaneously, and can be applied to large phylogenies.

A range of secondary metabolites has been identified from cultures of cyanobacteria and biomass collected from cyanobacterial bloom events. A comprehensive database is necessary to correctly identify cyanobacterial metabolites and advance research on their abundance, persistence and toxicity in natural environments. We consolidated open access databases and manually curated missing information from the literature published between 1970 and March 2020. The result is the database CyanoMetDB, which includes more than 2000 entries based on more than 750 literature references. This effort has more than doubled the total number of entries with complete literature metadata and structural composition (SMILES codes) compared to publicly available databases to this date. Over the past decade, more than one hundred additional secondary metabolites have been identified yearly. We organized all entries into structural classes and conducted substructure searches of the provided SMILES codes. This approach demonstrated, for example, that 65% of the compounds carry at least one peptide bond, 57% are cyclic compounds, and 30% carry at least one halogen atom. Structural searches by SMILES code can be further specified to identify structural motifs that are relevant for analytical approaches, research on biosynthetic pathways, bioactivity-guided analysis, or to facilitate predictive science and modeling efforts on cyanobacterial metabolites. This database facilitates rapid identification of cyanobacterial metabolites from toxic blooms, research on the biosynthesis of cyanobacterial natural products, and the identification of novel natural products from cyanobacteria.

In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the availability of the genome sequence, followed by the resequencing of tomato cultivars and its wild relatives, has provided a prodigious resource for the improvement of traits. A high-quality genome resequencing of 84 tomato accessions and wild relatives generated a dataset that can be used as a resource to identify agronomically important alleles across the genome. Converting this dataset into a searchable database, including information about the influence of SNPs on protein function, provides valuable information about the genetic variations. The database will assist in searching for functional variants of a gene for introgression into tomato cultivars.

ResultsA recent release of better-quality tomato genome reference assembly SL3.0, and new annotation ITAG3.2 of SL3.0, dropped 3,857 genes, added 4,900 novel genes, and updated 20,766 genes. Using the above version, we remapped the data from the tomato lines resequenced under the ""100 Tomato Genome ReSequencing Project"" on new tomato genome assembly SL3.0 and made an online searchable Tomato Genomic Variations (TGV) database. The TGV contains information about SNPs and InDels and expands it by functional annotation of variants with new ITAG3.2 using SIFT4G software. This database with search function assists in inferring the influence of SNPs on the function of a target gene. This database can be used for selecting SNPs, which can be potentially deployed for improving tomato traits.

Exponentially growing data sets require ever more optimization and performance with conventional computing capacities lacking this process. This creates a large overhead for software development in a research area which is primarily interested in solving complex biological problems rather than developing new, performant software solutions. In pure computer science, new structures in the field of web development have produced more efficient processes for container-based software solutions. The advantages of these structures have rarely been explored in a broader scientific scale. This is also the case with the trend of migrating computations from on premise resources to the cloud.

ResultsWe created Bio-Node, a new platform for large scale bio data analysis utilizing cloud compute resources (publicly available at https://bio-node.de). Bio-Node enables building complex workflows using a sophisticated web interface. We applied Bio-Node to implement bioinformatic workflows for rapid metagenome function annotation. We further developed ""Auto-Clustering"", a workflow that automatically extracts the most suited clustering parameters for specific data types and subsequently enables to optimally segregate unknown samples of the same type. Compared to existing methods and approaches Bio-Node improves performance and costs of bioinformatics data analyses while providing an easier and faster development process with focus on reproducibility and reusability.

With such predictive abilities in hand, researchers would be able to more accurately forecast how organisms will evolve and how proteins with novel functions could be engineered, leading to revolutionary advances in medicine and biotechnology. In this work, we assemble the largest reported set of experimental TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase folding free energies and use this data in conjunction with previously acquired fitness data and computational free energy predictions to determine how much of the fitness of {beta}-lactamase can be directly predicted by thermodynamic folding and binding free energies. We focus upon {beta}-lactamase because of its long history as a model enzyme and its central role in antibiotic resistance. Based upon a set of 21 {beta}-lactamase single and double mutants expressly designed to influence protein folding, we first demonstrate that modeling software such as FoldX and PyRosetta designed to compute folding free energies can meaningfully, although not perfectly, predict the experimental folding free energies of single mutants. Interestingly, while these techniques also yield sensible double mutant free energies, we show that they do so for the wrong physical reasons. We then go on to assess how well both experimental and computational folding free energies explain single mutant fitness. We find that folding free energies account for, at most, 24% of the variance in {beta}-lactamase fitness values according to linear models and, somewhat surprisingly, complementing folding free energies with computationally-predicted binding free energies of residues near the active site only increases the folding-only figure by a few percent. This strongly suggests that the majority of {beta}-lactamases fitness is controlled by factors other than free energies. Overall, our results shed a bright light on to what extent the community is justified in using thermodynamic measures to infer protein fitness as well as how applicable modern computational techniques for predicting free energies will be to the large data sets of multiply-mutated proteins forthcoming.","NA"

Therefore, therapeutic targeting of E6 and E7 genes can potentially be used to treat HPV-related cancers. Previous CRISPR/Cas9 studies on inactivation of E6 and E7 genes confirmed cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Here we report that CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout of E6 and E7 can also trigger cellular senescence in HPV18 immortalized HeLa cells. Specifically, HeLa cells in which E6 and E7 were inactivated exhibited characteristic senescence markers like enlarged cell and nucleus surface area, increased {beta}-galactosidase expression, and loss of lamin B1 with detection of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments. Furthermore, the knockout of HPV18 E6 and E7 proteins resulted in upregulation of p53/p21 and pRb/p21 levels in senescent cells. These senescent cells were devoid of characteristic apoptotic markers and re-introduction of codon-modified HPV18 E6 decreased p53 levels.

To support governments and political conventions, spatial guidance is needed to identify which areas should be managed for conservation to generate the greatest synergies between biodiversity and natures contribution to people (NCP). Here we present results from a joint optimization that maximizes improvements in species conservation status, carbon retention and water provisioning and rank terrestrial conservation priorities globally. We found that, selecting the top-ranked 30% (respectively 50%) of areas would conserve 62.4% (86.8%) of the estimated total carbon stock and 67.8% (90.7%) of all clean water provisioning, in addition to improving the conservation status for 69.7% (83.8%) of all species considered. If priority was given to biodiversity only, managing 30% of optimally located land area for conservation may be sufficient to improve the conservation status of 86.3% of plant and vertebrate species on Earth. Our results provide a global baseline on where land could be managed for conservation. We discuss how such a spatial prioritisation framework can support the implementation of the biodiversity and climate conventions.","NA"

We experimentally formed groups of house sparrows with high and low diversity of personality, and found that their physiological state (body condition, physiological stress, and oxidative stress) improved with increasing group-level diversity of personality. These findings demonstrate that group composition affects the condition of group members and individuals benefit from social heterosis (i.e. associating with a diverse set of behavioural types).

Although competence can be difficult to quantify, tick-borne pathogens can provide a useful model system, as larval ticks can become infected only when feeding on a competent host during their first bloodmeal. For tick-borne diseases, competence has been best studied for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), the pathogen that causes Lyme borreliosis, an increasing public health priority across the northern hemisphere. Major reservoirs include several small mammal species, but birds may play an underrecognized role in human risk of acquiring this tick-borne pathogen, given their ability to disperse infected ticks across large spatial scales. Here, we provide a global synthesis of the ecological and evolutionary factors that determine the ability of bird species to infect larval ticks with Bbsl. We find strong phylogenetic patterns in competence, which clusters in thrushes and has evolved multiple times across birds. With boosted regression trees, we distinguish competent birds with 76% accuracy and show competent species are more likely to fledge early, have low baseline corticosterone, breed at high latitudes, and have more diverse migratory movements into their breeding range. We use these trait profiles to predict over 100 likely but unsampled Bbsl-competent birds, including novel concentrations of avian reservoirs in the Neotropics and pelagic zones. Beyond expanding our understanding of avian reservoirs for tick-borne pathogens and generating new hypotheses, our findings also emphasize the need to consider competence in efforts to predict novel hosts of emerging diseases and in the study of multi-host pathogens.","NA"

Current interaction network structures are snapshots of dynamic processes of community assembly (Thompson, 2005), and represent the product of the evolutionary history of interacting species over millions of years. Thus, assessing the deep time mechanisms affecting the assembly of ecological networks are key to better understand biodiversity changes in broader time scales (Jablonski, 2008). Here we integrate tools from macroevolutionary studies with network science to show that more central species in frugivory networks belong to lineages with higher macroevolutionary stability. This association is more pronounced in warmer, wetter, less seasonal environments, which highlights the role of environmental factors in shaping ecological networks. Furthermore, our results suggest that these environments possess a more diverse (either in species number or ecology) assemblage of species that can be sorted during network assembly. Lastly, we found evidence that the macro-evolutionary contribution to network stability changes in geographical space. This reinforces the idea that the macroevolutionary sorting mechanism acts at the regional pool of species, rather than selecting absolute paces of diversification. Hence our results suggest an interplay between ecological roles and diversification regimes in shaping the fate of lineages of plants and seed dispersing birds.","NA"

In the migratory songbird yellow warbler (Setophaga petechia), we test the hypothesis that individuals track similar climates between their breeding and wintering ranges. Further, we examine whether adaptation to local climate might lead to morphological differences among populations and different demographic responses to temporal climate variability. We find a correlation between wintering and breeding precipitation but not temperature regimes at the level of the individual bird. Specifically, birds from the driest wintering regions migrate to the driest breeding regions. Additionally, we find an association between bill size and breeding season precipitation which, given documented climate-associated genomic variation, suggests adaptation to local precipitation gradients might exist on the breeding grounds. Finally, we show geographic variation in the effect of precipitation on demography, with higher precipitation associated with population increases in some regions and declines in others. Taken together, our results suggest that variation in climate optima exists across the breeding range of yellow warblers and provide a potential mechanism for parallel selection across the annual cycle.","NA"

Previous work revealed that the Andean hummingbirds Coeligena bonapartei and C. helianthea lack genetic divergence in the mitochondrial ND2 gene, which shows variation discordant with coloration phenotype but consistent with geography. We sequenced and analyzed complete mitochondrial genomes for C. b. bonapartei, C. b. consita, C. h. helianthea and C. h. tamai to assess whether patterns revealed by ND2 analyses hold when considering the entire mitogenome, and to shed light into the evolutionary history of these hummingbirds. We found very low genetic differentiation in mitogenomes among the four lineages of Coeligena, confirming patterns based on ND2 data. Estimates of genetic differentiation, phylogenies and haplotype network analyses of complete mitogenomes did not separate phenotypically distinct taxa, but were consistent with a previously described pattern of northern vs. southern divergence along the Cordillera Oriental of Colombia. Mitogenomes of C. b. bonapartei and C. h. helianthea are indistinguishable, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting or strong introgression. Mitogenomes of C. b. consita and C. h. tamai are slightly differentiated, but they are more similar to each other than either is to that of its respective nominate subspecies, a result also suggestive of mtDNA introgression despite distinct phenotypic differences. Our results indicate that various evolutionary mechanisms playing out over a complex biogeographic scenario in the Colombian Andes drove divergence in phenotypes and mitochondrial genomes of Coeligena hummingbirds, and lead to alternative hypotheses to be tested with whole-genome analyses.","NA"

We compare morphological and molecular results to highlight discrepancies and reveal possible inference bias. We analyse marker and taxon properties that may bias molecular inferences, with existing softwares and a new approach based on iterative principal component analysis to reduce variance between clusters of samples. For the first time, with both molecular and morphological data, we recover a monophyletic subgenus Urostigma and a clade with all gynodioecious fig trees. However, our analyses show that it is not possible to homogenize evolutionary rates and GC content for all taxa prior to phylogenetic inference and that four competing positions for the root of the molecular tree are possible. The placement of the long-branched section Pharmacosycea as sister to all other fig trees is not supported by morphological data and considered as a result of a long branch attraction artefact to the outgroups. Regarding morphological features and indirect evidence from the pollinator tree of life, the topology that divides the genus Ficus into monoecious versus gynodioecious species appears most likely. Active pollination is inferred as the ancestral state for all topologies, ambiguity remains for ancestral breeding system including for the favored topology, and it appears most likely that the ancestor of fig trees was a freestanding tree. Increasing sampling may improve results and would be at least as relevant as maximizing the number of sequenced regions given the strong heterogeneity in evolutionary rates, and to a lesser extent, base composition among species. Despite morphological plasticity and frequent homoplasy of multiple characters, we advocate giving a central role to morphology in our understanding of the evolution of Ficus, especially as it can help detect insidious systematic errors that tend to become more pronounced with larger molecular data sets.","NA"

To enhance the immune response for our vaccine design, truncated (residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1) has been utilized as an adjuvant at N terminal of both the MEVs. Further molecular models for both the MEVs were prepared and validated for their stable molecular interactions with Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR 3). The codon-optimized cDNA of both the MEVs were further analyzed for their potential of high level of expression in a human cell line. The present study is very significant in terms of molecular designing of prospective CTL and HTL vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the potential to elicit cellular as well as humoral immune response.

Efficient identification of subtypes is particularly important for tracking the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of infectious spread in real-time. In this paper, we utilize an entropy analysis to identify nucleotide sites within SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences that are highly informative of genetic variation, and thereby define an Informative Subtype Marker (ISM) for each sequence. We further apply an error correction technique to the ISMs, for more robust subtype definition given ambiguity and noise in sequence data. We show that, by analyzing the ISMs of global SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, we can distinguish interregional differences in viral subtype distribution, and track the emergence of subtypes in different regions over time. Based on publicly available data up to April 5, 2020, we show, for example: (1) distinct genetic subtypes of infections in Europe, with earlier transmission linked to subtypes prevalent in Italy with later development of subtypes specific to other countries over time; (2) within the United States, the emergence of an endogenous U.S. subtype that is distinct from the outbreak in New York, which is linked instead to subtypes found in Europe; and (3) dynamic emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from localization in China to a pattern of distinct regional subtypes in different countries around the world over time. Our results demonstrate that utilizing ISMs for genetic subtyping can be an important complement to conventional phylogenetic tree-based analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, because ISMs are efficient and compact subtype identifiers, they will be useful for modeling, data-mining, and machine learning tools to help enhance containment, therapeutic, and vaccine targeting strategies for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. We have made the subtype identification pipeline described in this paper publicly available at https://github.com/EESI/ISM.","NA"

The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has so far claimed more than 60,000 lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 displays high transmission rates, their underlying genomic severity is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of the spread of the virus. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighboring countries suggesting that the outbreak is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nsp13-16 (ORF1b polyprotein) and S-Protein within 10 viral isolates from the USA. These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication, indicating highly evolved viral strains circulating in the population of USA than other countries. Furthermore, we found an amino acid addition in nsp16 (mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase) of the USA isolate (MT188341) leading to shift in amino acid frame from position 2540 onwards. Through the construction of SARS-CoV-2-human interactome, we further revealed that multiple host proteins (PHB, PPP1CA, TGF-{beta}, SOCS3, STAT3, JAK1/2, SMAD3, BCL2, CAV1 & SPECC1) are manipulated by the viral proteins (nsp2, PL-PRO, N-protein, ORF7a, M-S-ORF3a complex, nsp7-nsp8-nsp9-RdRp complex) for mediating host immune evasion. Thus, the replicative machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is fast evolving to evade host challenges which need to be considered for developing effective treatment strategies.","NA"

We demonstrate two modes of RTX use - (i) dye-based RT-qPCR assays that require only RTX polymerase, and (ii) TaqMan RT-qPCR assays that use a combination of RTX and Taq DNA polymerases (as the RTX exonuclease does not degrade a TaqMan probe). We also provide straightforward recipes for the purification of this alternative reagent. We anticipate that in low resource or point-of-need settings researchers could obtain the available constructs from Addgene or our lab and begin to develop their own assays, within whatever regulatory framework exists for them.

We lay out protocols for dye-based and TaqMan probe-based assays, in order to best compare with  gold standard reagents. These protocols should form the basis of further modifications that can simplify the assay to the use of overexpressing cells themselves as reagents.

The decision for choosing an upcoming saccade target can be framed as a dilemma: Should the observer further exploit the information near the current gaze position or continue with exploration of other patches within the given scene? While several models attempt to describe the dynamics of saccade target selection, none of them explicitly addresses the underlying Exploration-Exploitation dilemma. Here we propose and investigate a mathematical model motivated by the Exploration-Exploitation dilemma in scene viewing. The model is derived from a minimal set of assumptions that generates realistic eye movement behavior. We implemented a Bayesian approach for model parameter inference based on the models likelihood function. In order to simplify the inference, we applied data augmentation methods that allowed the use of conjugate priors and the construction of an efficient Gibbs sampler. This approach turned out to be numerically efficient and permitted fitting interindividual differences in saccade statistics. Thus, the main contribution of our modeling approach is two-fold; first, we propose a new model for saccade generation in scene viewing. Second, we demonstrate the use of novel methods from Bayesian inference in the field of scan path modeling.

Author summaryThe Exploration-Exploitation dilemma is general concept that has been investigated in human information processing. We investigate whether the Exploration-Exploitation trade-off is a viable approach to model sequences of fixations generated by a human observer in a free viewing task with natural scenes. Variants of the basic model are used to predict to the experimental data based on Bayesian inference. Results indicate a high predictive power for both aggregated data and individual differences across observers. The combination of a novel model with state-of-the-art Bayesian methods lends support to the Exploration-Exploitation framework in the field of eye-movement research.","NA"

Its only European populations are distributed discontinuously along the south-eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, forming plant communities with great ecological value, unique in Europe. As it is an endangered species that makes up plant communities with great palaeoecological significance, the development of species distribution models is of major interest under different climatic scenarios, past, present and future, based on the fact that the climate could play a relevant role in the distribution of this species as well as in the conformation of the communities in which it is integrated. Palaeoecological models were generated for the Maximum Interglacial, Last Maximum Glacial and Middle Holocene periods. The results obtained showed that the widest distribution of this species, and the maximum suitability of its habitat, occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum, when the temperatures of the peninsular southeast were not as contrasting as those of the rest of the European continent and were favored by higher rainfall. Under these conditions, large territories could act as shelters during the glacial period, a hypothesis reflected in the models results for this period, which exhibit a further expansion of G. senegalensis ecological niche. The future projection of models in around 2070, for four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) according to the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC, showed that the most favorable areas for this species would be Campo de Dalias (southern portion of Almeria province) as it presents the bioclimatic characteristics of greater adjustment to G. senegalensis ecological niche model. Currently, these areas are almost totally destroyed and heavily altered by intensive agriculture under plastic, also causing a severe fragmentation of the habitat, which implies a prospective extinction scenario in the near future.","NA"

M.","Biaty Raymond","Wageningen Universiteit en Research","2020-04-16",1,"cc_by","new results","genetics","Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in large human cohorts have identified thousands of loci associated with complex traits and diseases. For identifying the genes and gene-associated variants that underlie complex traits in livestock, especially where sample sizes are limiting, it may help to integrate the results of GWAS for equivalent traits in humans as prior information. In this study, we sought to investigate the usefulness of results from a GWAS on human height as prior information for identifying the genes and gene-associated variants that affect stature in cattle, using GWAS summary data on samples sizes of 700,000 and 58,265 for humans and cattle, respectively. Using Fishers exact test, we observed a significant proportion of cattle stature-associated genes (30/77) that are also associated with human height (odds ratio = 5.1, p = 3.1e-10). Result of randomized sampling tests showed that cattle orthologs of human height-associated genes, hereafter referred to as candidate genes (C-genes), were more enriched for cattle stature GWAS signals than random samples of genes in the cattle genome (p=0.01). Randomly sampled SNPs within the C-genes also tend to explain more genetic variance for cattle stature (up to 13.2%) than randomly sampled SNPs within random cattle genes (p=0.09). The most significant SNPs from a cattle GWAS for stature within the C-genes did not explain more genetic variance for cattle stature than the most significant SNPs within random cattle genes (p=0.87). Altogether, our findings support previous studies that suggest a similarity in the genetic regulation of height across mammalian species. However, with the availability of a powerful GWAS for stature that combined data from 8 cattle breeds, prior information from human-height GWAS does not seem to provide any additional benefit with respect to the identification of genes and gene-associated variants that affect stature in cattle.

Author SummaryProvided that there is a similarity in the biological control of complex traits in different species, the results of genome-wide association study for a given trait in a model species can be utilized as prior information to identify genes and gene-associated variants that affect the same trait in a non-model species. Here we report that the number of genes found to be affecting height in both humans and cattle is more than can be expected by chance, suggesting a similarity in the biology of height in both species. In addition, genes that are associated with height in humans were found to be highly enriched with variants that are strongly associated with height in cattle. Using height as a model trait, we demonstrated that across-species prior information cannot compete with a within-species prior information, with respect to the identification of genes and the gene-associated variants that affect a complex trait. Across-species prior information can be useful, however, when within-species prior information is either unavailable or poor.","NA"

MethodologyThis is a two years retrospective analysis of cases of patients for whom endometrial biopsy was taken at a territory referral hospital in urban Ethiopia. Odds ratios, 95% confidence interval and p-value set at 0.05 were used to determine the statistical significance of the associations.

ResultsA total of 277 patient records were analyzed and mean and the median age of the study patients were 41.89 and 40.00 years respectively. The commonest histopathologic finding was endometrial polyp 66 (23.83%), followed by proliferative endometrium 47 (16.97%) and secretory endometrium 25(9.03%). Endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial malignancy, and pregnancy complications were reported in 9 (3.25%), 13 (4.69%), and 25 (9.03%) of cases respectively. Endometritis was detected in 20(7.22%), while Tuberculous (TB) endometritis was reported in 3(1.08%) of cases only.

Sertraline or aripiprazole significantly increased the permeability of pimozide in Caco-2 cell monolayers. ATPase assay indicated that pimozide is a P-gp substrate, and might act as a P-gp inhibitor at higher concentrations. The values of the kinetic parameters of carrier-mediated efflux, calculated from the concentration dependence of pimozide efflux from LLC-GA5-COL150 cells expressing human P-gp, were as follows: maximum transport rate (Jmax) = 84.9 {+/-} 8.9 pmol/min/mg protein, half-saturation concentration (Kt) = 10.6 {+/-} 4.7 M, first-order rate constant (kd) = 0.67 {+/-} 0.14 pmol/min/mg protein. Further, the efflux ratio of pimozide in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells was significantly decreased in the presence of sertraline or aripiprazole. These results indicate that pimozide is a substrate of P-gp, and its efflux is inhibited by sertraline and aripiprazole.

As transcription is a time-dependent process, it is expected that gene expression will be inversely related to gene length, and this is found to be the case. Here I describe the results of studies performed with the human genome to test whether the gene length/gene expression linkage is affected by two factors, the chromosome where the gene is located and the tissue where it is expressed.

Experimental designStudies were carried out with a database of 2413 human genes that were divided into short, mid-length and long groups. Each of the 24 human chromosomes was then characterized according to the proportion of each gene length group present. A similar analysis was performed with 19 human tissues. The proportion of short, mid-length and long genes was noted for each tissue.

ResultsBoth chromosome and tissue studies revealed new information about the role of gene length in control of gene expression. Chromosome studies led to the identification of two chromosome populations that differ in the level of short gene expression. Tissue studies support the conclusion that short, highly expressed genes are enriched in tissues that produce protein products that are exported from the host cell.","NA"

This included a loss of rare taxa, especially amongst members of the Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Betaproteobacteria, but enrichment in the Fe- and nitrate-reducing Ferribacterium and parasitic Bdellovibrio. These shifted communities were more similar to the contaminated well community, suggesting that geochemical forces substantially influence microbial community diversity and structure. These influences can only be captured through such comprehensive temporal studies, which also enable more robust and accurate predictive models to be developed.","NA"

Sequence data from the 5 region of the cpn60 barcode amplified from the human vaginal microbiome (n=45), and a mock community were used to compare variant calling to de novo assembly of reads, and mapping to a reference sequence database in terms of number of OTU formed, and overall community composition.

The basic unit of information in these traces is the arrival time of individual photons, which carry instantaneous information from the molecule, from which they are emitted, to the detector on timescales as fast as microseconds. Thus, it is theoretically possible to monitor molecular dynamics at such timescales from traces containing only a sufficient number of photon arrivals. In practice, however, traces are stochastic and in order to deduce dynamical information through traditional means-such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and related techniques-they are collected and temporally autocorrelated over several minutes. So far, it has been impossible to analyze dynamical properties of molecules on timescales approaching data acquisition without collecting long traces under the strong assumption of stationarity of the process under observation or assumptions required for the analytic derivation of a correlation function. To avoid these assumptions, we would otherwise need to estimate the instantaneous number of molecules emitting photons and their positions within the confocal volume. As the number of molecules in a typical experiment is unknown, this problem demands that we abandon the conventional analysis paradigm. Here, we exploit Bayesian nonparametrics that allow us to obtain, in a principled fashion, estimates of the same quantities as FCS but from the direct analysis of traces of photon arrivals that are significantly smaller in size, or total duration, than those required by FCS.","10.1103/PhysRevX.10.011021"

Before the formation of the mitotic spindle, multiple visible microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), coalesce into a single focus to serve as an SPB. We propose a  grow-and-catch model, in which cytoplasmic MTs (cMTs) nucleated by MTOCs grow and catch each other, promote MTOC clustering. Our quantitative modeling identifies multiple redundant mechanisms mediated by cMT-cell cortex interactions and inter-cMT coupling, facilitating MTOC clustering within the experimental time frame. Implementing a similar stochastic model in mitotic spindle where MTs  grow-and-catch KTs, we demonstrate that impaired error correction leads to an erroneous partitioning of chromosomes between mother and daughter cells with equal proportions. However, either a marginal delay in the MT nucleation from the SPB of daughter bud (dSPB) or an enhanced MT nucleation from the SPB in mother (mSPB) needs to account for asymmetric chromosome segregation, as observed in Ipl1 depleted cells. Using an analytical model screen, we predict plausible mechanistic conditions for proper spindle positioning. We find that MT buckling together with dynein pull and cortical push maintains proper spindle localization.

Author summaryCells actively self-assemble bipolar spindle to facilitate chromosomal segregation. In the semi-open mitosis of budding yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, before spindle formation, multiple MTOCs embedded on the outer nuclear envelop cluster into a single SPB. The SPB duplicates and organizes spindle, positioning within the daughter bud near the septin ring during anaphase. A mechanistic understanding of MTOC clustering, spindle positioning and chromosomal division in C. neoformans are discussed in coherence with experiments. Our computational MT  grow-and-catch model identified possible redundant mechanisms for timely MTOC clustering via (a) minus-ended motors crosslinking and sliding anti-parallel cMTs from different MTOCs on the nuclear envelop and (b) biased cMTs (Bim1-mediated) sliding along cortex toward septin ring pull MTOCs in presence of suppressed dynein activity. Using an analytical model and stochastic MT dynamics simulations, we screened various MT-based forces to detect steady spindle positioning. Screening results reveal that proper spindle positioning near the septin ring requires MT buckling from the cell cortex. Furthermore, using an extended model with stochastic MT-KT interaction, we predict that impaired MT nucleation from SPB in daughter together with error correction defects leads to unequal chromosomal division.","NA"

Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections.

In addition, variation in size and age at maturity in males can be associated with different reproductive strategies; younger smaller males may gain reproductive success by sneaking in among mating pairs. In both sexes there is a trade-off between older age and increased reproductive success and increased risk of mortality by delaying reproduction. We identified four Y-chromosome haplogroups that showed regional and population-specific variation in frequency using RADseq data for 21 populations of Alaska Chinook salmon. We then characterized the range-wide distribution of these haplogroups using GT-seq assays. These haplogroups exhibited associations with size at maturity in multiple populations suggesting that the lack of recombination between X and Y-chromosomes has allowed Y-chromosome haplogroups to capture different alleles that influence size at maturity.

However, the regulation of biofilm development is very complex and can include multiple, highly interconnected signal transduction/response pathways, which are incompletely understood. We demonstrated previously that in the opportunistic, human pathogen P. aeruginosa, the PP2C-like protein phosphatase SiaA and the di-guanylate cyclase SiaD control the formation of macroscopic cellular aggregates, a type of suspended biofilms, in response to surfactant stress. In this study, we demonstrate that the SiaABC proteins represent a signal response pathway that functions through a partner switch mechanism to control biofilm formation. We also demonstrate that SiaABCD functionality is dependent on carbon substrate availability for a variety of substrates, and that upon carbon starvation, SiaB mutants show impaired dispersal, in particular with the primary fermentation product ethanol. This suggests that carbon availability is at least one of the key environmental cues integrated by the SiaABCD system. Further, our biochemical, physiological and crystallographic data reveals that the phosphatase SiaA and its kinase counterpart SiaB balance the phosphorylation status of their target protein SiaC at threonine 68 (T68). Crystallographic analysis of the SiaA-PP2C domain shows that SiaA is present as a dimer. Dynamic modelling of SiaA with SiaC suggested that SiaA interacts strongly with phosphorylated SiaC and dissociates rapidly upon dephosphorylation of SiaC. Further, we show that the known phosphatase inhibitor fumonisin inhibits SiaA mediated phosphatase activity in vitro. In conclusion, the present work improves our understanding of how P. aeuruginosa integrates specific environmental conditions, such as carbon availability and surfactant stress, to regulate cellular aggregation and biofilm formation. With the biochemical and structural characterization of SiaA, initial data on the catalytic inhibition of SiaA, and the interaction between SiaA and SiaC, our study identifies promising targets for the development of biofilm-interference drugs to combat infections of this aggressive opportunistic pathogen.

Author SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that is feared within clinical environments due to its potential to cause life-threatening acute and chronic infections. One cornerstone of its success is the ability to form and disperse from biofilms, which are self-made, multicellular structures that protect the individual cell from the human immune system and antibiotic treatment. As such, therapies that combine a biofilm-interference strategy and the use of antimicrobial drugs represent one of the promising strategies to tackle infections of this organism. With the current study, we gain a deeper understanding of the SiaABCD mediated biofilm formation in response to clinically relevant environmental conditions. Further, our structural and biochemical characterization of the PP2C-type protein-phosphatase SiaA and the partner switch protein SiaC suggest that both represent promising novel targets for the development of future anti-biofilms drugs based on a signal interference strategy.","NA"

Pack","Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University","2020-04-16",2,"cc_by_nd","new results","neuroscience","Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) modulates brain activity by passing electrical current through electrodes that are attached to the scalp. Because it is safe and non-invasive, it holds great promise as a tool for basic research and clinical treatment. However, little is known about how tACS ultimately influences neural activity. One hypothesis is that tACS affects neural responses directly, by producing electrical fields that interact with the brains endogenous electrical activity. Since the shape and location of these electric fields can be controlled, stimulation could be targeted at brain regions associated with particular behaviors or symptoms. However, an alternative hypothesis is that tACS affects neural activity indirectly, via peripheral sensory afferents. In particular, it has often been hypothesized that tACS acts on nerve fibers in the skin, which in turn provide rhythmic input to central neurons. In this case, there would be little possibility of targeted brain stimulation, as the regions modulated by tACS would depend entirely on the somatosensory pathways originating in the skin around the stimulating electrodes. Here, we directly test these competing hypotheses by recording single-unit activity in the hippocampus and visual cortex of monkeys receiving tACS. We find that tACS entrains neuronal activity in both regions, so that cells fire synchronously with the stimulation. Blocking somatosensory input with a topical anesthetic does not significantly alter these neural entrainment effects. These data are therefore consistent with the direct stimulation hypothesis and suggest that peripheral somatosensory stimulation is not required for tACS to entrain neurons.","NA"

This pressing clinical issue may be resolved by enhancing plasticity in the adult brain. One strategy for triggering robust plasticity in adulthood is to reproduce one of the hallmark physiological events of experience-dependent plasticity observed during the juvenile critical period - rapidly reduce the activity of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons and disinhibit local excitatory neurons. This may be achieved through enhancement of local inhibitory inputs, particularly those of somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons. However, to date the means for manipulating SST interneurons for enhancing cortical plasticity in the adult brain are not known. We show that SST interneuron-selective overexpression of Lypd6, an endogenous nicotinic signaling modulator, enhances ocular dominance plasticity in the adult primary visual cortex (V1). Lypd6 overexpression mediates a rapid experience-dependent increase in the visually evoked activity of SST interneurons as well as a simultaneous reduction in PV interneuron activity and disinhibition of excitatory neurons. Recapitulating this transient activation of SST interneurons using chemogenetics similarly enhanced V1 plasticity. Notably, we show that SST-selective Lypd6 overexpression restores visual acuity in amblyopic mice that underwent early long-term monocular deprivation. Our data in both male and female mice reveal selective modulation of SST interneurons and a putative downstream circuit mechanism as an effective method for enhancing experience-dependent cortical plasticity as well as functional recovery in adulthood.

Significance StatementThe decline of cortical plasticity after closure of juvenile critical period consolidates neural circuits and behavior, but this limits functional recovery from brain diseases and dysfunctions in later life. Here we show that activation of cortical SST interneurons by Lypd6, an endogenous modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), enhances experience-dependent plasticity and recovery from amblyopia in adulthood. This manipulation triggers rapid reduction of PV interneuron activity and disinhibition of excitatory neurons, which are known hallmarks of cortical plasticity during juvenile critical periods. Our study demonstrates modulation of SST interneurons by Lypd6 to achieve robust levels of cortical plasticity in the adult brain and may provide promising targets for restoring brain function in the event of brain trauma or disease.","NA"

Our aim was to assess whether modulation of collinear lateral inhibition can be achieved within a short time-frame using a single 20-minute session of primary visual cortex anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS). Thirteen observers with normal vision performed a 2AFC contrast detection task with collinear flankers positioned at a distance of 2{lambda} from the target (lateral inhibition) or 6{lambda} (control condition). The stimuli were presented 6{degrees} to the left of a central cross and fixation was monitored with an infra-red eye tracker. Participants each completed two randomly sequenced, single-masked stimulation sessions; real anodal tDCS and sham tDCS.

No effects of a-tDCS were observed for the 6{lambda} separation condition.

To ensure veracity we used three weekly sessions and analyzed both resting state and TMS-EEG data. For the TMS responses our analysis verifies known results. For the resting state we introduce the methodology of mean-normalized variation to the EEG analysis (quartile-based coefficient of variation), which allows for a comparison of narrow-band EEG amplitude fluctuations to narrow-band Gaussian noise. This reveals that amplitude fluctuations in the delta, alpha and beta bands of healthy controls are different from those in schizophrenia patients, on time scales of tens of seconds. We conclude that the EEG-measured cortical activity patterns of schizophrenia patients are more similar to noise, both in alpha and beta resting state and in TMS responses.

Cell proliferation is regulated by volume, but in 3D clusters it remains unclear how multiple cells interact to control their size. In this study, we propose a mechano-osmotic model to investigate the evolution of volume dynamics within multicellular systems. Volume control depends on an interplay between multiple cellular constituents, including gap junctions, mechanosensitive ion channels, energy consuming ion transporters, and the actomyosin cortex, that coordinate to manipulate cellular osmolarity. In connected cells, mechanical loading is shown to significantly affect how these components cooperate to transport ions, and precise volume control is impacted by the emergence of osmotic pressure gradients between cells. Consequent increases in cellular ion concentrations drive swelling, while a loss of ions impedes the compression resistance of cells. Combining the modeling framework with novel experiments, we identify how gap junctions can amplify spatial variations in cell volume within multicellular spheroids and, further, describe how the process depends on proliferation-induced solid stress. Our model provides new insight into the role of gap junctions in cancer progression and can help guide the development of therapeutics that target inter- and extra-cellular ion transport.","NA"

THE PAPER EXPLAINEDO_ST_ABSProblemC_ST_ABSIn response to peripheral nerve damage, Schwann cells (SCs) are able to transform into specialized repair cells essential for nerve cell regeneration. Our previous studies indicated that this reactive/adaptive potential of human SCs is not restricted to injured nerve cells but also emerges in response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor cells. The usually benign subtypes of peripheral neuroblastic tumors, i.e. ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas, contain neuronal differentiating tumor cells and are pervaded by various portions of stromal SCs. Of note, the amount of stromal SCs correlates with a favorable tumor behavior and increased patient survival, whereas aggressive subtypes of peripheral neuroblastic tumors, i.e. neuroblastomas, usually lack stromal SCs and have bad prognosis. This enigma prompted us to investigate the molecular wiring and functional state of stromal SCs versus injury-associated repair SCs and how SC signals could be leveraged as therapeutics.

ResultOur study revealed that the cellular state of stromal SCs in ganglioneuromas is in many aspects very similar to human repair SCs in injured nerves as both, stromal SCs and repair SCs, are equipped with distinct nerve repair-associated functions. Hence, we exposed different cell lines, derived from high-risk metastatic neuroblastomas, to primary repair SCs or their secretome. The results demonstrated that repair SCs had a pro-differentiating and anti-proliferative effect of on neuroblastoma cell lines upon direct and/or indirect contact. Searching for secreted anti-tumor factors by transcriptome and proteome analyses identified that the matricellular protein EGFL8 was highly expressed in injured nerves and ganglioneuromas. EGFL8 gene expression in peripheral neuroblastic tumors further correlated with increased patient survival. Indeed, treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with recombinant EGFL8 promoted neuronal differentiation and present EGFL8 as a novel neuritogen.

ImpactThese findings demonstrate that stromal SCs are equipped with the tools to exert nerve repair-associated functions on peripheral neuroblastic tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. We further show that the pool of secreted stromal/repair SC molecules contains yet uncharacterized factors with a therapeutic potential for aggressive neuroblastomas. We conclude that the inherent plasticity (reactive/adaptive potential) of SCs is responsible for the development of usually benign ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas and, thus, is of utmost interest to be exploited in future treatment approaches for aggressive neuroblastoma subtypes.","NA"

We report dysregulated expression of Wwc2, an ill-characterised paralog of the Hippo-signalling activator Kibra/Wwc1, is specifically associated with cell autonomous deficits in embryo cell number and cell division abnormalities, typified by imbalanced daughter cell chromatin segregation. Division phenotypes are also observed during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation, as Wwc2 dysregulation blocks progression to the fertilisation competent stage of meiosis II metaphase arrest, characterised by spindle defects and failed Aurora-A kinase (AURKA) activation. Such cell division defects, each occurring in the absence of centrosomes, are fully reversible by expression of recombinant HA-epitope tagged WWC2, restoring activated oocyte AURKA levels. Additionally, clonal dysregulation implicates Wwc2 in maintaining the pluripotent late blastocyst stage epiblast lineage. Thus, Wwc2 is a novel regulator of meiotic and early mitotic cell divisions, and mouse blastocyst cell-fate.","NA"

However, the function of lncRNA in fibroblast activation is still poorly understood. In this study, we identified growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) as a novel regulator for TGF-{beta}-induced fibroblast activation. GAS5 expression was downregulated in cultured fibroblasts by TGF-{beta} and in resident fibroblasts from bleomycin-treated skin tissues. Overexpression of GAS5 suppressed TGF-{beta}-induced fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation. Mechanistically, GAS5 directly bound Smad3 and promoted Smad3 binding to PPM1A, a Smad3 dephosphatase, and thus accelerated Smad3 dephosphorylation in TGF-{beta}-treated fibroblasts. In addition, GAS5 inhibited fibroblast proliferation. Importantly, local delivery of GAS5 via adenoviral vector suppressed bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis in mice. Collectively, our data revealed that GAS5 suppresses fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis through inhibiting TGF-{beta}/Smad3 signaling, which provides a rationale for an lncRNA-based therapy to treat fibrotic diseases.","NA"

The predictive power of PRS constructed from these studies is substantially lower in non-European ancestry cohorts, although the reasons for this are unclear. To address this question, we investigate the performance of PRS for height in cohorts with admixed African and European ancestry, allowing us to evaluate ancestry-related differences in PRS predictive accuracy while controlling for environment and cohort differences. We first show that that the predictive accuracy of height PRS increases linearly with European ancestry and is largely explained by European ancestry segments of the admixed genomes. We show that differences in allele frequencies, recombination rate, and marginal effect sizes across ancestries all contribute to the decrease in predictive power, but none of these effects explain the decrease on its own. Finally, we demonstrate that prediction for admixed individuals can be improved by using a linear combination of PRS that includes ancestry-specific effect sizes, although this approach is at present limited by the small size of non-European ancestry discovery cohorts.","NA"

Using replicate experiments, we first show how to learn the natural variability of read counts by inferring the distributions of clone sizes as well as an explicit noise model relating true frequencies of clones to their read count.

We focus on the unitary LFP (uLFP) generated by single neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. We first reproduce experimental results for hippocampal basket cells, and in particular how inhibitory uLFP are distributed within hippocampal layers. Next, we calculate the uLFP generated by pyramidal neurons, using morphologically-reconstructed CA3 pyramidal cells. The model shows that the excitatory uLFP is of small amplitude, smaller than inhibitory uLFPs. Indeed, when the two are simulated together, inhibitory uLFPs mask excitatory uLFPs, which might create the illusion that the inhibitory field is generated by pyramidal cells. These results provide an explanation for the observation that excitatory and inhibitory uLFPs are of the same polarity, in vivo and in vitro. These results also show that somatic inhibitory currents are large contributors of the LFP, which is important information to interpret this signal. Finally, the results of our model might form the basis of a simple method to compute the LFP, which could be applied to point neurons for each cell type, thus providing a simple biologically-grounded method to calculate LFPs from neural networks.","NA"

We manipulated the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supplies to oat plants in growth chambers and evaluated interactions between two aphid-vectored Barley and Cereal Yellow Dwarf Viruses: PAV and RPV. We quantified the effect of each virus on the others establishment, within-plant density, and transmission. Co-inoculation significantly increased PAV density when N and P supplies were low and tended to increase RPV density when N supply was high. Co-infection increased PAV transmission when N and P supplies were low and tended to increase RPV transmission when N supply was high. Despite the parallels between the effects of among-pathogen interactions on density and transmission, changes in virus density only partially explained changes in transmission, suggesting that virus density-independent processes contribute to transmission. A mathematical model describing the spread of two viruses through a plant population, parameterized with empirically derived transmission values, demonstrated that nutrition-mediated among-pathogen interactions could affect disease spread. Interactions that altered transmission through virus density-independent processes determined overall disease dynamics. Our work suggests that host nutrition alters disease spread through among-pathogen interactions that modify transmission.","NA"

In the last 10 years reference panels have increased in size by more than 100 fold. Increasing reference panel size improves accuracy of markers with low minor allele frequencies but poses ever increasing computational challenges for imputation methods.

Here we present IMPUTE5, a genotype imputation method that can scale to reference panels with millions of samples. This method continues to refine the observation made in the IMPUTE2 method, that accuracy is optimized via use of a custom subset of haplotypes when imputing each individual. It achieves fast, accurate, and memory-efficient imputation by selecting haplotypes using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT). By using the PBWT data structure at genotyped markers, IMPUTE5 identifies locally best matching haplotypes and long identical by state segments. The method then uses the selected haplotypes as conditioning states within the IMPUTE model.

Using the HRC reference panel, which has ~65,000 haplotypes, we show that IMPUTE5 is up to 30x faster than MINIMAC4 and up to 3x faster than BEAGLE5.1, and uses less memory than both these methods. Using simulated reference panels we show that IMPUTE5 scales sub-linearly with reference panel size. For example, keeping the number of imputed markers constant, increasing the reference panel size from 10,000 to 1 million haplotypes requires less than twice the computation time. As the reference panel increases in size IMPUTE5 is able to utilize a smaller number of reference haplotypes, thus reducing computational cost.

Author summaryGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) typically use microarray technology to measure genotypes at several hundred thousand positions in the genome. However reference panels of genetic variation consist of haplotype data at >100 fold more positions in the genome. Genotype imputation makes genotype predictions at all the reference panel sites using the GWAS data. Reference panels are continuing to grow in size and this improves accuracy of the predictions, however methods need to be able to scale to increased size. We have developed a new version of the popular IMPUTE software than can handle referenece panels with millions of haplotypes, and has better performance than other published approaches. A notable property of the new method is that it scales sub-linearly with reference panel size. Keeping the number of imputed markers constant, a 100 fold increase in reference panel size requires less than twice the computation time.","NA"

The gene network responsible for anthocyanin pigmentation, in particular, has become a model for investigating how genetic changes give rise to phenotypic innovation. In the monkeyflower genus Mimulus, an evolutionarily recent gain of petal lobe anthocyanin pigmentation in M. luteus var. variegatus was previously mapped to genomic region pla2. Here, we use DNA sequence analysis and spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression to identify MYB5a - homologous to the NEGAN transcriptional activator from M. lewisii - as a likely candidate gene within the pla2 region. Transgenic manipulation of gene expression confirms that MYB5a is both necessary and sufficient for petal lobe anthocyanin pigmentation. The deployment of MYB5a/NEGAN to the petal lobe stands in contrast to its more restricted role as a nectar guide anthocyanin activator in other Mimulus species. Transcriptome sequencing of a MYB5a RNAi line reveals the degree to which other regulators of the anthocyanin pathway - including R3 MYB repressors and bHLH and WD40 co-activators - are responsive to the level of expression of MYB5a. Overall, this work reveals that a genetically simple change, which we hypothesize to be a regulatory mutation in cis to MYB5a, has cascading effects on gene expression, not only on the genes downstream of MYB5a but also on all of its known partners in the anthocyanin regulatory network.

This research is motivated by the possibility to restore bladder function in elderly patients or after spinal cord injury using implanted devices, so called bioelectronic medicines. For these devices, nerve-based estimation of intravesical pressure can enable a personalized and on-demand stimulation paradigm, which will be more effective and efficient. In this context, a better understanding of the encoding strategies employed by the body might in the future be exploited by informed decoding algorithms that enable a precise and robust bladderpressure estimation.

ApproachTo this end, we apply information theory to microelectrode-array recordings from the cat sacral dorsal root ganglion while filling the bladder, conduct surrogate data studies to augment the data we have, and finally decode pressure in a simple informed approach.

Main resultsWe find an encoding scheme by different main bladder neuron types that we divide into three response types (slow tonic, phasic, and derivative fibres). We show that an encoding by different bladder neuron types, each represented by multiple cells, offers reliability through within-type redundancy and high information rates through near-independence of different types. Our subsequent decoding study shows a potentially more robust decoding from mean responses of homogeneous cell pools.

SignificanceWe have here, for the first time, analysed the encoding of intravesical pressure by a population of sensory neurons in a principled way using information theory. We show that even a simple adapted decoder can exploit the redundancy in the population to be more robust against cell loss. This work thus paves the way towards principled encoding studies in the periphery and towards a new generation of informed peripheral nerve decoders for bioelectronic medicines.","NA"

Such an encounter leads to the formation of a stable di-ribosome complex, which needs to be resolved by a dedicated machinery. The initial stalling and the subsequent resolution of di-ribosomal complexes requires activity of Makorin and ZNF598 ubiquitin E3 ligases respectively, through ubiquitylation of the eS10 and uS10 sub-units of the ribosome. It is common for the stability of RING E3 ligases to be regulated by an interacting deubiquitylase (DUB), which often opposes auto-ubiquitylation of the E3. Here, we show that the DUB USP9X directly interacts with ZNF598 and regulates its abundance through the control of protein stability in human cells. We have developed a highly specific small molecule inhibitor of USP9X. Proteomics analysis, following inhibitor treatment of HCT116 cells, confirms previous reports linking USP9X with centrosome associated protein stability and reveals loss of ZNF598 and Makorin 2. In the absence of USP9X or following chemical inhibition of its catalytic activity, steady state levels of Makorins and ZNF598 are diminished and the ribosomal quality control pathway is impaired.","NA"

We apply stratified LD score regression (S-LDSC) to 41 independent diseases and complex traits (average N=320K) to evaluate each annotations informativeness for disease heritability conditional on a broad set of coding, conserved, regulatory and LD-related annotations from the baseline-LD model and other sources; as a secondary metric, we also evaluate the accuracy of models that incorporate deep learning annotations in predicting disease-associated or fine-mapped SNPs. We aggregated annotations across all tissues (resp. blood cell types or brain tissues) in meta-analyses across all 41 traits (resp. 11 blood-related traits or 8 brain-related traits). These allelic-effect annotations were highly enriched for disease heritability, but produced only limited conditionally significant results - only Basenji-H3K4me3 in meta-analyses across all 41 traits and brain-specific Basenji-H3K4me3 in meta-analyses across 8 brain-related traits. We conclude that deep learning models are yet to achieve their full potential to provide considerable amount of unique information for complex disease, and that the informativeness of deep learning models for disease beyond established functional annotations cannot be inferred from metrics based on their accuracy in predicting regulatory annotations.","NA"

We propose a Bayesian whole genome regression model, LEMMA, for joint modeling of main genetic effects and gene-environment interactions in large scale datasets such as the UK Biobank, where many environmental variables have been measured. The method estimates a linear combination of environmental variables, called an environmental score (ES), that interacts with genetic markers throughout the genome, and provides a readily interpretable way to examine the combined effect of many environmental variables. The ES can be used both to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to GxE effects, and also to test for GxE effects at genetic variants across the genome. GxE effects can induce heteroscedasticity in quantitative traits and LEMMA accounts for this using robust standard error estimates when testing for GxE effects. When applied to body mass index, systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure in the UK Biobank we estimate that 9.3%, 3.9%, 1.6% and 12.5% of phenotypic variance is explained by GxE interactions, and that low frequency variants explain most of this variance.

We find that prototrophic C. albicans populations differentially and stochastically express cytoprotective epigenetic programs. For all drugs, there is evidence that tolerant individuals partition into distinct subpopulations, each with a unique survival strategy involving different regulatory programs. These responses are weakly related to changes in morphology (shift from white to opaque forms, or shift from yeast to filamentous forms). In turn, those subpopulations that successfully reach resistance each have a distinct multivariate epigenetic response that coordinates the expression of efflux pumps, chaperones, transport mechanisms, and cell wall maintenance. Live cell fluorescent imaging was used to validate predictions of which molecular responses most often led to survival after drug exposure. Together our findings provide evidence that C. albicans has a robust toolkit of short-term epigenetic cytoprotective responses designed to ""buy time"" and increase the chance of acquiring long-term resistance.","NA"

Here we present a large genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) of childhood AGG.

MethodsWe analyzed assessments of AGG for a total of 328,935 observations from 87,485 children (aged 1.5 - 18 years), from multiple assessors, instruments, and ages, while accounting for sample overlap. We performed an overall analysis and meta-analyzed subsets of the data within rater, instrument, and age.

ResultsHeritability based on the overall meta-analysis (AGGall) that could be attributed to Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) was 3.31% (SE=0.0038). No single SNP reached genome-wide significance, but gene-based analysis returned three significant genes: ST3GAL3 (P=1.6E-06), PCDH7 (P=2.0E-06) and IPO13 (P=2.5E-06). All three genes have previously been associated with educational traits. Polygenic scores based on our GWAMA significantly predicted aggression in a holdout sample of children and in retrospectively assessed childhood aggression. We obtained moderate-to-strong genetic correlations (rg s) with selected phenotypes from multiple domains, but hardly with any of the classical biomarkers thought to be associated with AGG. Significant genetic correlations were observed with most psychiatric and psychological traits (range |rg|: 0.19 -.1.00), except for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Aggression had a negative genetic correlation (rg =[~]-0.5) with cognitive traits and age at first birth. Aggression was strongly genetically correlated with smoking phenotypes (range |rg|: 0.46 - 0.60). Genetic correlations between AGG and psychiatric disorders were strongest for mother- and self-reported AGG.

ConclusionsThe current GWAMA of childhood aggression provides a powerful tool to interrogate the genetic etiology of AGG by creating individual polygenic scores and genetic correlations with psychiatric traits.","NA"

The gut mycobiome composition were determined by high-throughput sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) gene amplicons, while the plasma and fecal metabolome was determined by GC-TOF-MS. The gut microbiome of the subjects investigated is home to three main eukaryotic phyla, namely Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota, with genera Penicillium, Candida, and Aspergillus being particularly common. Hypertriglyceridemia was associated with fewer observed fungal species, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix-based analysis showed significant (P<0.05) clustering according to fasting levels of circulating plasma triglycerides (Tg) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol fasting levels, respectively. Interestingly, neither hypertriglyceridemia nor elevated VLDL levels were reflected in the prokaryotic component of the gut microbiome as determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Higher levels of Tg and VLDL cholesterol significantly associates with increased relative abundance of genus Penicillium, possibly mediated by a higher dietary fat intake (ANOVA, P<0.05), and Aspergillus and Guehomyces were positively associated with SCFAs groups. Collectively, these findings suggest that in older adults gut mycobiome dysbiosis is associated with hypertriglyceridemia, a known risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease.","NA"

Despite causing an extraintestinal infection, it harbors few known virulence factors and was assigned into phylogenetic group B1. To evaluate if the EC121 was pathogenic or opportunistic, its genome was sequenced, and an in vitro characterization of some pathogenicity-associated properties was performed. The data retrieved from genome analysis showed that E. coli strain EC121 belongs to the O154:H25 serotype, and to ST101-B1, which was epidemiologically linked to extraintestinal infections and antimicrobial resistance spread as well. Moreover, it was closely related to Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC). Besides, strain EC121 is an MDR strain harboring 14 antimicrobial resistance genes, including blaCTX-M-2, and more than 50 complete virulence genetic clusters, which are reported to be associated either with DEC or ExPEC. The strain also displays the capacity to adhere to a variety of cell lineages, and invade T24 bladder cells, as well as the ability to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces, and survive the bactericidal serum complement activity. Additionally, it is virulent in the Galleria mellonella model. Altogether, E. coli EC121 unveiled to be a pathogen powered by its multi-drug resistance characteristic. Carry out studies providing accurate information about the virulence potential of all kinds of MDR strains are essential because these studies will help in the development of alternative therapies of infection management and spread control of MDR strains.

Authors summaryThe phylogenetic origin of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli is mostly associated with phylogroup B2, and the majority of the studies regarding extraintestinal infection focus on the most virulent strains, which might also present multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype. Strains belonging to phylogroup B1 and isolated from extraintestinal infections are considered as opportunist pathogens and have their virulence neglected. We focus our study in one MDR strain isolated from bloodstream infection that belongs to phylogenetic group B1 to enlarge the knowledge about the virulence of this kind of strain. We demonstrated that the EC121 is capable of adheres to intestinal and bladder human cells, and invades the latter one; it survives to human serum bactericidal effects and produces biofilm. Additionally, the in vivo assay confirmed the EC121 virulence, showing that it should be considered a pathogenic strain. The genetic analyzes highlighted important aspects of EC121 which are typical from strains of sequence type 101, like its involvement in the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and its relationship with extraintestinal infection from diverse sources. Information concerning the virulence of MDR strains is important for the development of global actions treating the spread of antimicrobial resistance, as well as to elucidate the pathogenesis of strains that were considered as an opportunist.","NA"

This study was motivated by our interest in better understanding the microbiome structure and composition of the ascidian, Synoicum adareanum, in which the bioactive macrolide that has specific activity to melanoma, palmerolide A (PalA), was found. PalA bears structural resemblance to a combined nonribosomal peptide polyketide, that has similarities to microbially-produced macrolides. We conducted a spatial survey to assess both PalA levels and microbiome composition in S. adareanum in a region of the Antarctic Peninsula near Anvers Island (64{degrees} 46'S, 64{degrees} 03'W). PalA was ubiquitous and abundant across a collection of 21 ascidians (3 subsamples each) sampled from seven sites across the Anvers Island archipelago. The microbiome composition (V3-V4 16S rRNA gene sequence variants) of these 63 samples revealed a core suite of 21 bacteria, 20 of which were distinct from regional bacterioplankton. Co-occurrence analysis yielded several potentially interacting subsystems and, although the levels of PalA detected were not found to correlate with specific sequence variants, the core members appeared to occur in a preferred optimum and tolerance range of PalA levels. Taking these results together with an analysis of biosynthetic potential of related microbiome taxa indicates a core microbiome with substantial promise for natural product biosynthesis that likely interact with the host and with each other.","NA"

Recent evidence suggests that D2R and D3R antagonism oppositely affect the locomotor-activating effects of cocaine, but whether this pattern extends to opioid-induced hyperactivity remains unresolved.

ObjectiveThis study compared the impact of selective D2R vs. D3R antagonists on the locomotor-activating effects of acute and repeated morphine administration in mice. Catalepsy following D2R vs. D3R antagonism alone or in combination with morphine was also assessed.

MethodsC57Bl/6J mice were pretreated with either the highly-selective D3R antagonist PG01037 (vehicle, 10.0 mg/kg) or the selective D2R antagonist L-741,626 (vehicle, 10.0 mg/kg) and tested for 1) locomotor activity induced by acute morphine administration (10.0 - 56.0 mg/kg), 2) locomotor sensitization following repeated morphine administration (56.0 mg/kg), or 3) catalepsy after administration of either antagonist alone or in combination with morphine (10.0 - 56.0 mg/kg).

ResultsIn locomotion studies, both PG01037 and L-741,626 shifted the acute morphine dose-response function rightward/downward, although the inhibitory effect of L-741,626 pretreatment was more robust. Likewise, PG01037 pretreatment partially attenuated, while L-741,626 pretreatment fully abolished, morphine-induced locomotor sensitization. L-741,626 produced catalepsy that was blunted by morphine, whereas PG01037 did not induce catalepsy under any conditions.

ConclusionsD2R or D3R antagonism attenuates morphine-induced locomotor activity and sensitization. D2R antagonism produces a stronger suppression of these effects, but also induced modest cataleptic effects which were not observed following D3R antagonism. The results lend additional support to the investigation of selective D3R antagonists as treatments for OUD.","NA"

We explored the effect of light spectral quality on ARI in de-rooted Norway spruce seedlings as well as on hormone metabolism with sensitive mass spectrometry-based methods. We coupled this to gene expression analysis to identify potential signaling pathways and to extensive anatomical characterization to investigate ARI at the cellular level. We showed that in contrast to white light and blue light, red light promoted ARI likely by reducing jasmonate (JA) and JA-isoleucine biosynthesis and repressing the accumulation of isopentyl-adenine-type cytokinins and abscisic acid. We confirmed that exogenously applied JA and/or CK inhibit ARI, and found that they possibly act in the same pathway. The negative effect of JA was confirmed at the histological level. We showed that JA represses the early events of ARI. In conclusion, RL promotes ARI by repressing the accumulation of the wound-induced phytohormones JA and CK.

Surface receptor-mediated immunity has been extensively studied but in authentic interactions between plants and microbial pathogens, its presence impedes study of intracellular receptor-mediated immunity alone. How these two immune pathways interact is poorly understood. Here, we reveal mutual potentiation between these two recognition-dependent defense pathways. Recognition by surface receptors activates multiple protein kinases and NADPH oxidases, whereas intracellular receptors primarily elevate abundance of these proteins. Reciprocally, the intracellular receptor-dependent hypersensitive cell death response is strongly enhanced by activation of surface receptors. Activation of either immune system alone is insufficient to provide effective resistance against Pseudomonas syringae. Thus, immune pathways activated by cell-surface and intracellular receptors mutually potentiate to activate strong defense that thwarts pathogens. By studying the activation of intracellular receptors in the absence of surface receptor-mediated immunity, we have dissected the relationship between the two distinct immune systems.

Here, we describe the validation of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A comparison of antibody profiles detected on the array from control sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic versus convalescent blood specimens from virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrates complete discrimination of these two groups. This array can be used as a diagnostic tool, as an epidemiologic tool to more accurately estimate the disease burden of COVID-19, and as a research tool to correlate antibody responses with clinical outcomes.","NA"

In particular, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an established contributor to multiple sclerosis, lupus, and other disorders. Previously, we demonstrated that the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) transactivating protein occupies up to half of the risk loci for a set of seven autoimmune disorders. To further examine the mechanistic roles played by EBNA2 at these loci on genome-wide scale, we globally examined gene expression, chromatin accessibility, chromatin looping, and EBNA2 binding, in a B cell line that was 1) uninfected, 2) infected with a strain of EBV lacking EBNA2, or 3) infected with a strain that expresses EBNA2. We identified >400 EBNA2-dependent differentially expressed human genes and >4,000 EBNA2 binding events in the human genome. ATAC-seq analysis revealed >3,000 regions in the human genome with EBNA2-dependent chromatin accessibility, and HiChIP-seq data revealed >2,000 regions where EBNA2 altered chromatin looping interactions. Importantly, autoimmune genetic risk loci were highly enriched at the sites of these EBNA2-dependent chromatin-altering events. We present examples of autoimmune risk genotype-dependent EBNA2 events, nominating genetic risk mechanisms for autoimmune risk loci such as ZMIZ1 and CD80. Taken together, our results reveal important interactions between host genetic variation and EBNA2-driven disease mechanisms. Further, our study highlights a critical role for EBNA2 in rewiring human gene regulatory programs through rearrangement of the chromatin landscape and nominates these interactions as components of genetic mechanisms that influence the risk of multiple autoimmune diseases.","NA"

X.","Marcel A. de Leeuw","GeneCreek, Inc.","2020-04-17",2,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","cancer biology","BackgroundThe microbiome is thought to play a role in the development of gastric cancer (GC). Several studies have put forward putatively carcinogenic species in addition to Helicobacter pylori, but are not in perfect alignment, possibly due to variable parameters in the experiments, including downstream processing. Meta-analyses have not been published so far, so there is lack in clinical guidance beyond H. pylori eradication therapy.

MethodsHere, we analysed gastric mucosa samples from nine public data sets, including GC samples. Using both unsupervised and supervised learning, we defined fine grain bacterial networks of gastric mucosa and identified species associated with tumor status of samples.

ResultsWe found anatomic locations and cohort regions among the possible factors leading to the observation of study specific gastric microbiomes. Despite this variability, the periodontal species Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra and Peptostreptococcus stomatis were found in association with tumor status in several datasets. The three species were predicted to be in interaction by ecological network analysis and also formed the intersection of tumor associated species between four GC data sets and five colorectal cancer (CRC) data sets we reanalyzed. We formulated a probiotic composition putatively competing with the GC pathogen spectrum, from correlation analysis in a large superset of gut samples (n=17,800) from clinical- and crowd-sourced studies.

ImplicationsThe overlapping bacterial pathogen spectrum between two gastrointestinal tumor types, GC and CRC, has implications for etiology, treatment and prevention. In vitro testing results reported in literature suggest H. pylori eradication treatment should be efficient against the GC pathogen spectrum, yet the existence of an upstream periodontal reservoir is of concern. To address this, we propose longer term use of the formulated probiotics composition.","NA"

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes a condition characterized by high fever, headache, rash, and joint pain. Recent investigations reveal presence of bone lesions and erosive arthritis in the joints of CHIKV infected patients, indicating an association of bone pathology with CHIKV infection. However, the molecular mechanism underlying CHIKV-induced bone pathology remains poorly defined. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) contribute to bone homeostasis by differentiating into osteogenic cells which later mature to form the bone. Disruption of osteogenic differentiation and function of BMSCs lead to bone pathologies. Studies show that virus infections can alter the properties and function of BMSCs. However, to date, pathogenesis of CHIKV infection in this context has not been studied. In the current study, we investigated the susceptibility of BMSCs and osteogenic cells to CHIKV and studied the effect of infection on these cells. To our knowledge, for the first time we report that CHIKV can productively infect BMSCs and osteogenic cells. We also observed a decreased gene expression of the major regulator of osteogenic differentiation, RUNX2 in CHIKV infected osteogenic cells. Furthermore, impaired functional properties of osteogenic cells i.e. decreased production and activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and matrix mineralization were observed in the presence of CHIKV infection. Thus, we conclude that CHIKV likely impairs osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs indicating a possible role of BMSCs in altering bone homeostasis during CHIKV infection.

ImportancePresently, no vaccines or treatment options are available for CHIKV infection. Joint pain is one of the major concerns. Although studies have shown an association between bone pathology and infection, the molecular pathogenesis in context of bone pathology is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that BMSCs and BMSC-derived osteogenic cells are susceptible to CHIKV infection and infection likely alters function of the osteogenic cells. This study highlights altered osteogenic differentiation as a possible mechanism for causing the bone pathology observed in CHIKV pathogenesis.","NA"

These enzymes known to possess auxiliary activity are produced by numerous bacterial and fungal species to assist in the degradation of cellulosic biomass. In this study, we annotated and performed structural analysis of an uncharacterized thermostable LPMO from Penicillium funiculosum (PfLPMO9) in an attempt to understand nature of this enzyme in biomass degradation. PfLPMO9 exhibited 75% and 36% structural identity to Thermoascus aurantiacus (TaLPMO9A) and Lentinus similis (LsLPMO9A), respectively. Analysis of the molecular interactions during substrate binding revealed that PfLPMO9 demonstrated a higher binding affinity with a {Delta}G free energy of -46 k kcal/mol when compared with that of TaLPMO9A (-31 kcal/mol). The enzyme was further found to be highly thermostable at elevated temperature with a half-life of [~]88 h at 50 {degrees}C. Furthermore, multiple fungal genetic manipulation tools were employed to simultaneously overexpress this LPMO and Cellobiohydrolase I (CBH1) in catabolite derepressed strain of Penicillium funiculosum, PfMig188, in order to improve its saccharification performance towards acid pretreated wheat straw (PWS) at 20% substrate loading. The resulting transformants showed [~]200% and [~]66% increase in LPMO and Avicelase activities, respectively. While the secretomes of individually overexpressed LPMO and CBH1-strains increased saccharification of PWS by 6% and 13%, respectively, over PfMig188 at same enzyme concentration, the simultaneous overexpression of these two genes led to 20% increase in saccharification efficiency over PfMig188, which accounted for 82% saccharification of PWS at 20% substrate loading.

ImportanceEnzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass by cellulases continues to be a significant bottleneck in the development of second-generation bio-based industries. While efforts are being intensified at how best to obtain indigenous cellulase for biomass hydrolysis, the high production cost of this enzyme remains a crucial challenge confronting its wide availability for efficient utilization of cellulosic materials. This is because it is challenging to get an enzymatic cocktail with balanced activity from a single host. This report provides for the first time the annotation and structural analysis of an uncharacterized thermostable lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) gene in Penicillium funiculosum and its impact in biomass deconstruction upon overexpression in catabolite derepressed strain of P. funiculosum. Cellobiohydrolase I (CBH1) which is the most important enzyme produced by many cellulolytic fungi for saccharification of crystalline cellulose was further overexpressed simultaneously with the LPMO. The resulting secretome was analyzed for enhanced LPMO and exocellulase activities with the corresponding improvement in its saccharification performance at high substrate loading by [~]20% using a minimal amount of protein.","NA"

Recent advancements have made it possible to generate and analyse genome-wide PPI networks en masse by coupling Y2H with next-generation sequencing technology. However, one of the major challenges of yeast two-hybrid assay is the large amount of false-positive hits caused by auto-activators (AAs), which are proteins that activate the reporter genes without the presence of an interacting protein partner. Here, we have developed a negative selection to minimize these auto-activators by integrating the pGAL2-URA3 fragment into the yeast genome. Upon activation of the pGAL2 promoter by an AA, yeast cells expressing URA3 cannot grow in media supplemented with 5-Fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). Hence, we selectively inhibit the growth of yeast cells expressing auto-activators and thus minimizing the amount of false-positive hits. Here, we have demonstrated that auto-activators can be successfully removed from a Marchantia polymorpha cDNA library using pGAL2-URA3 and 5-FOA treatment, in liquid and solid-grown cultures. Furthermore, since URA3 can also serve as a marker for uracil autotrophy, we propose that our approach is a valuable addition to any large-scale Y2H screen.","NA"

Thus, three quarters of the recorded vGAT neurons in the ZI-LH were most active during sleep. In the NREM-max group Ca2+ fluorescence anticipated the initiation of NREM sleep onset and remained high throughout sleep (NREM and REM sleep). In the REM-max neurons Ca2+fluorescence increased before the onset of REM sleep and stayed elevated during the episode.

Several studies have suggested that the propagation direction of travelling waves can be task-dependent. For example, a recent EEG study from our group found that forward waves (i.e. occipital to frontal, FW waves) were observed during visual processing, whereas backward waves (i.e. frontal to occipital, BW waves) mostly occurred in the absence of sensory input. These EEG recordings, however, were obtained from different experimental sessions and different groups of subjects. To further examine how the waves direction changes between task conditions, 13 participants were tested on a target detection task while EEG signals were recorded simultaneously. We alternated visual stimulation (5 s display of visual luminance sequences) and resting state (5 s of black screen) within each single trial, allowing us to monitor the moment-to-moment progression of travelling waves. As expected, the waves direction was closely linked with task conditions (visual processing vs. rest state). First, FW waves from occipital to frontal regions, absent during rest, emerged as a result of visual processing, while BW waves in the opposite direction dominated in the absence of visual inputs, and were reduced (but not eliminated) by external visual inputs. Second, during visual stimulation (but not rest), both waves coexisted on average, but were negatively correlated. That is, when the FW waves were stronger than expected based on alpha amplitude alone, the BW waves tended to be weaker, and vice-versa. In summary, we conclude that the functional role of travelling waves is closely related with their propagating direction, with stimulus-evoked FW waves supporting visual processing and spontaneous BW waves involved more in top-down control.","NA"

Posttraining optogenetic stimulation of this pathway enhances retention of spatial memories. Evidence also indicates that intra-BLA administration of memory-enhancing drugs increases protein levels of activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (ARC) in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and that blocking ARC in the DH impairs spatial memory consolidation. Yet, whether optical manipulations of the BLA-mEC pathway after spatial training also alter ARC in the DH is unknown. To address this question, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats received optogenetic stimulation of the BLA-mEC pathway immediately after spatial training using a Barnes maze and, 45 min later, were sacrificed for ARC analysis. Initial experiments found that spatial training increased ARC levels in the DH of rats above those observed in control rats and rats that underwent a cued-response version of the task. Optogenetic stimulation of the BLA-mEC pathway following spatial training, using parameters effective at enhancing spatial memory consolidation, enhanced ARC protein levels in the DH of male rats without affecting ARC levels in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) or somatosensory cortex. In contrast, similar optical stimulation decreased ARC protein levels in the DLS of female rats without altering ARC in the DH or somatosensory cortex.

However, as pulmonary hypertension is only partially reversible by oxygen administration, other etiological factors are likely involved. In human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary artery remodeling contributes to the development of pulmonary hypertension. In rodent models, pulmonary vascular remodeling is present as a consequence of allergic airway inflammation. The present study investigated the presence of remodeling of the pulmonary arteries in severe equine asthma, its distribution throughout the lungs, and its reversibility following long-term antigen avoidance strategies and inhaled corticosteroid administration. Using histomorphometry, the total wall area of pulmonary arteries from different regions of the lung of asthmatic horses and controls was measured. The smooth muscle mass of pulmonary arteries was also estimated on lung sections stained for -smooth muscle actin. Reversibility of vascular changes in asthmatic horses was assessed after 1 year of antigen avoidance alone or treatment with inhaled fluticasone. Pulmonary arteries showed increased wall area in apical and caudodorsal lung regions of asthmatic horses in both exacerbation and remission. The pulmonary arteries smooth muscle mass was similarly increased. Both treatments reversed the increase in wall area. However, normalization of the vascular smooth muscle mass was observed only after treatment with antigen avoidance, but not with fluticasone. In conclusion, severe equine asthma is associated with remodeling of the pulmonary arteries consisting in an increased smooth muscle mass. The resulting narrowing of the artery lumen could enhance hypoxic vasoconstriction, contributing to pulmonary hypertension. Vascular smooth muscle mass normalization is better achieved by antigen avoidance than with inhaled corticosteroids.","NA"

Nevertheless, only a few published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed separately in each sex. The reported enrichment of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) among GWAS-associated SNPs suggests a potential role of sex-specific eQTLs in the sex-specific genetic mechanism underlying complex traits.

To explore this scenario, we performed a genome-wide analysis of sex-specific whole blood RNA-seq eQTLs from 3,447 individuals. Among 9 million SNP-gene pairs showing sex-combined associations, we found 18 genes with significant sex-specific cis-eQTLs (FDR 5%). Our phenome-wide association study of the 18 top sex-specific eQTLs on >700 traits unraveled that these eQTLs do not systematically translate into detectable sex-specific trait-associations. Power analyses using real eQTL- and causal effect sizes showed that millions of samples would be necessary to observe sex-specific trait associations that are fully driven by sex-specific cis-eQTLs. Compensatory effects may further hamper their detection. In line with this observation, we confirmed that the sex-specific trait-associations detected so far are not driven by sex-specific cis-eQTLs.","NA"

Most afferents receive inputs from bouton terminals that contact type II hair cells as well as from calyx terminals that cover the basolateral walls of type I hair cells. Calyces have an abundance of different subtypes of KCNQ (Kv7) potassium channels and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and receive cholinergic efferent inputs from neurons in the brainstem. We investigated whether mAChRs affected membrane properties and firing patterns of calyx terminals through modulation of KCNQ channel activity. Patch clamp recordings were performed from calyx terminals in central regions of the cristae of the horizontal and anterior canals in 13 - 18 day old Sprague-Dawley rats. KCNQ mediated currents were observed as voltage sensitive currents with slow kinetics (activation and deactivation), resulting in spike frequency adaptation so that calyces at best fired a single action potential at the beginning of a depolarizing step. Activation of mAChRs by application of oxotremorine methiodide or inhibition of KCNQ channels by linopirdine dihydrochloride decreased voltage activated currents by [~]30%, decreased first spike latencies by [~]40%, decreased spike thresholds by [~]50%, and resulted in continuous firing during depolarizing steps. Interestingly, some of the calyces showed spontaneous discharge in the presence of these drugs. Together, these findings suggest that cholinergic efferents can modulate the response properties and encoding of head movements by afferents.","NA"

Oxidative stress causes dysfunction of GABAergic parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVI), which are crucial for the coordination of neuronal synchrony during sensory- and cognitive-processing. Mitochondria are the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neurons and they control synaptic activity through their roles in energy production and intracellular calcium homeostasis. We have previously shown that in male mice transient blockade of NMDA receptors during development (subcutaneous injections of 30 mg/kg ketamine (KET) on postnatal days 7, 9, and 11) results in long-lasting alterations in synaptic transmission and reduced parvalbumin expression in the adult prefrontal cortex (PFC), contributing to a behavioral phenotype that mimics multiple symptoms associated with schizophrenia. These changes correlate with oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial function in both PVI and pyramidal cells. Here, we show that genetic deletion (Ppif-/-) of the mitochondrial matrix protein cyclophilin D (CypD) prevents perinatal KET-induced increases in ROS and the resulting deficits in PVI function, and changes in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the PFC. Deletion of CypD also prevented KET-induced behavioral deficits in cognitive flexibility, social interaction, and novel object recognition. Taken together, these data highlight how mitochondrial activity may play an integral role in modulating PVI-mediated cognitive processes.

Significance StatementMitochondria are important modulators of oxidative stress and cell function, yet how mitochondrial dysfunction affects cell activity and synaptic transmission in psychiatric illnesses is not well understood. NMDA receptor blockade with ketamine during development causes oxidative stress, dysfunction of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVI), and long-lasting physiological and behavioral changes. Here we show that mice deficient for the mitochondrial matrix protein cyclophilin D show robust protection from PVI dysfunction following perinatal NMDAR-blockade. Mitochondria serve as an essential node for a number of stress-induced signaling pathways and our experiments suggest that failure of mitochondrial redox regulation can contribute to PVI dysfunction.","NA"

Recent studies applying dimensionality reduction techniques to resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) have unveiled neurocognitively meaningful connectivity gradients that are present in both human and primate brains, and appear to differ meaningfully among individuals and clinical populations. Here, we provide a critical assessment of the suitability of connectivity gradients for biomarker discovery. Using the Human Connectome Project (discovery subsample=209; two replication subsamples= 209x2) and the Midnight scan club (n=9), we tested the following key biomarker traits - reliability, reproducibility and predictive validity - of functional gradients. In doing so, we systematically assessed the effects of three analytical settings, including i) dimensionality reduction algorithms (i.e., linear vs. non-linear methods), ii) input data types (i.e., raw time series, [un-]thresholded functional connectivity), and iii) amount of the data (R-fMRI time-series lengths). We found that the reproducibility of functional gradients across algorithms and subsamples is generally higher for those explaining more variances of whole-brain connectivity data, as well as those having higher reliability. Notably, among different analytical settings, a linear dimensionality reduction (principal component analysis in our study), more conservatively thresholded functional connectivity (e.g., 95-97%) and longer time-series data (at least [&ge;]20mins) was found to be preferential conditions to obtain higher reliability. Those gradients with higher reliability were able to predict unseen phenotypic scores with a higher accuracy, highlighting reliability as a critical prerequisite for validity. Importantly, prediction accuracy with connectivity gradients exceeded that observed with more traditional edge-based connectivity measures, suggesting the added value of a low-dimensional gradient approach.

Animal studies demonstrated that Purkinje cells (PCs) are especially vulnerable for hypoxic-ischemic injury. In neonates, however, the extent and pattern of PC injury has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of PC injury in the cerebellar vermis of term born neonates with HIE.

MethodsTerm born neonates with HIE that underwent post-mortem autopsy of the cerebellar vermis were included. Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stained sections of the vermis were used to determine total PC count and morphology (normal, abnormal or non-classified) at the bases and crown of the folia and of the lobules in both the anterior and posterior lobes. Differences in PC count and PC morphology between the anterior and posterior lobe and between the bases and crown were calculated using the paired samples T-test or Wilcoxon-signed rank test.

ResultsThe total number of PCs were significantly higher at the crown compared to the bases (p<0.001) irrespective of the precise location.

The monovalent cation proton antiporter (CPA) superfamily comprises Na+/H+ exchanger (NHX), K+ efflux antiporter (KEA), and cation/H+ exchanger (CHX) subfamily proteins, which play vital functions in maize salt tolerance.

ResultsA total of 35 ZmCPA genes were identified in maize, and they were phylogenetically classified into 13 ZmNHXs, 16 ZmCHXs and 6 ZmKEAs. ZmCPA genes have a conserved gene structure, with the determined introns range from 11 to 25, 0 to 5 and 16 to 19 in ZmNHXs, ZmCHXs, ZmKEAs, respectively. All proteins have transmembrane domains, with an average transmembrane number of 8, 10, and 10 in ZmNHX, ZmCHX and ZmKEA proteins, respectively. Transient expression in maize protoplasts showed that ZmCHX16 and ZmNHX8 are located in the cell membrane. All ZmCHX subfamily genes showed lower expression compared to ZmNHX and ZmKEA subfamilies. Diverse expression in the 60 tissues and modulated expression in response to salt stress suggested ZmCPAs role in maize development and salt stress. Yeast complementary experiment revealed the function of ZmNHX8, ZmCHX8, -12, -14, -16 and ZmKEA6 in salt tolerance. Maize mutants zmnhx8 and zmkea6 further validated the important function of ZmNHX8 and ZmKEA6 in salt tolerance. Phosphorylation sites and cis-acting regulation elements analyses indicated that phosphorylation and transcriptional regulation may be involved in salt tolerance of ZmCPA genes.

Considerable research efforts are thus currently focused on the generation of synthetic methylotrophs by transferring methanol assimilation pathways into established bacterial production hosts. In this study, we used an iterative combination of dry and wet approaches to design, implement and optimize this metabolic trait in the most common chassis, E. coli. Through in silico modeling, we designed a new route that ""mixed and matched"" two methylotrophic enzymes: a bacterial methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh) and a dihydroxyacetone synthase (Das) from yeast. To identify the best combination of enzymes to introduce into E. coli, we built a library of 266 pathway variants containing different combinations of Mdh and Das homologues and screened it using high-throughput 13C-labeling experiments. The highest level of incorporation, 22% of labeled methanol carbon into the multi-carbon compound PEP, was obtained using a variant composed of a Mdh from A. gerneri and a codon-optimized version of P. angusta Das. Finally, the activity of this new synthetic pathway was further improved by engineering strategic metabolic targets identified using omics and modelling approaches. The final synthetic strain had 1.5 to 5.9 times higher methanol assimilation in intracellular metabolites and proteinogenic amino acids than the starting strain did. Broadening the repertoire of methanol assimilation pathways is one step further toward synthetic methylotrophy in E. coli.","NA"

Progression is accompanied by a switch to an invasive cell phenotype. Nutrient-limiting environments exhibit chemotaxis with aggressive morphologies characteristic of invasion. The mTOR pathway senses essential nutrients, informing the cell to respond with either increased chemotaxis and nutrient uptake or cell cycle progression. Randomized clinical trials have shown that mTOR inhibitors (mTOR-I) improve the outcome of metastatic breast cancer patients. However, there are considerable differences between and within tumors that impact the effectiveness of mTOR-I, including differences in access to nutrients. It is unknown how co-existing cells differ in their response to nutrient limitations and how this impacts invasion of the metapopulation as a whole. We integrate modeling with microenvironmental perturbations data to investigate invasion in nutrient-limiting environments inhabited by one or two cancer cell subpopulations. Hereby subpopulations are defined by their energy efficiency and chemotactic ability. We calculate the invasion-distance traveled by a homogeneous population. For heterogeneous populations, our results suggest that an imbalance between nutrient efficacy and chemotactic superiority accelerates invasion. Such imbalance will segregate the two populations spatially and only one type will dominate at the invasion front. Only if these two phenotypes are balanced do the two populations compete for the same space, which decelerates invasion. We investigate ploidy as a candidate biomarker of this phenotypic heterogeneity to discern circumstances when inhibiting chemotaxis amplifies innternal competition and decelerates tumor progression, from circumstances that render clinical consequences of chemotactic inhibition unfavorable.

SignificanceA better understanding of the nature of the double-edged sword of high ploidy is a prerequisite to personalize combinationtherapies with cytotoxic drugs and inhibitors of signal transduction pathways such as MTOR-Is.","NA"

However, neurocognitive deficits affecting educational attainment in individuals with ADHD could be risk factors for Alzheimers later in life while hyper plasticity of the brain in ASD and strong positive genetic correlations of ASD with IQ and educational attainment could be protective against Alzheimers.

MethodsWe estimated the bidirectional total causal effects of genetic liability to ADHD and ASD on Alzheimers disease through two-sample Mendelian randomization. We investigated their direct effects, independent of educational attainment and IQ, through Multivariable Mendelian randomization.

ResultsThere was limited evidence to suggest that genetic liability to ADHD (OR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.02, p=0.39) or ASD (OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.01, p=0.70) was associated with risk of Alzheimers disease. Similar causal effect estimates were identified when the direct effects, independent of educational attainment (ADHD: OR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.01, p=0.07; ASD: OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.00, p=0.28) and IQ (ADHD: OR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.02. p=0.29; ASD: OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.01, p=0.99), were assessed.

ConclusionsIn the first study to date investigating the causal associations between genetic liability to ADHD, ASD and Alzheimers, within an MR framework, we found limited evidence to suggest a causal effect.

Tau seeds enhance the propagation of disease along with its contribution to microglia-mediated inflammation. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to exert the anti-inflammatory property to microglia by modulating cell membrane compositions. The immunomodulatory function of omega-3 fatty acids exerts anti-inflammatory property to microglia. Owing to the imparted anti-inflammatory nature enhance phagocytosis and increased migration property has been observed in microglia. The dietary omega-3 fatty acids are found to change the lipid composition of the cell membrane that predominated many signaling cascade and by modulating specific receptor response. Thus the omega-3 fatty acids influence microglial response in Tauopathy.

MethodsN9 microglia cells were exposed to extracellular full-length Tau monomer and aggregates along with ALA (- Linolenic acid) to study the internalization of exposed Tau. The degradation of internalized Tau studied with the endosomal markers Rab5 and Rab7. The final degradation step in phagocytosis has been studied with LAMP-2A as lysosomal markers. The changes in the rate of migration of microglia were assessed by wound-scratch assay along with Microtubule organizing center (MTOC) reorientation were studied after exposure of Tau and ALA as the property of highly migratory microglia. The role of actin in phagocytosis and migration was observed with the study of actin structures lamellipodia, filopodia, and membrane ruffling. The formation of extensive actin branching in lamellipodia and membrane ruffling was studied with the help of ARP2/3 complex for nucleating actin network.

ResultsThe increased phagocytosis of extracellular Tau monomer and aggregates has been observed upon ALA exposure to microglia cells. The intracellular degradation of internalized Tau species was targeted by early and late endosomal markers Rab5 and Rab7. The increase levels of LAMP-2A and colocalization with internalized Tau indicated the degradation via lysosome. These results indicate the degradation of internalized Tau species in the presence of ALA instead of getting accumulated in the cell. The enhanced migratory ability of microglia in the presence of ALA induces the MTOC repolarization and reduces the nuclear-centrosomal axis polarity and favorable anterior positioning of MTOC. The increased migration also complemented with the enhance actin remodeling through lamellipodia, filopodia and membrane ruffles formation along with Iba-1 protein. The high density of ARP2/3 complex at the leading ends of migratory microglia confirmed the extensive branching of actin filaments on ALA exposure.

ConclusionsTau seeds greatly contributes to the spread of disease, one way to reduce the spreading is to reduce the presence of extracellular Tau seed. Microglia could be influenced to reduce extracellular Tau seed with dietary fatty acids. Our results suggest that dietary fatty acids ALA significantly enhance phagocytosis and intracellular degradation of internalized Tau. The actin dynamics and enhanced migration supports the phagocytosis process. Our approach provides the insights of beneficial role of ALA as antiinflammatory dietary supplement to treat AD.","NA"

It grows wild in a wide range of altitude in the Indian Himalayan region and contains some important phytochcemicals which possess remarkable medicinal properties. The plant contains terpenoid like Forskolin in its roots.

ObjectiveConsidering the medicinal importance of C. forskohlii, being the only source of Forskolinand its availability over a wide altitude range, the effect of altitude on the metabolic diversity and forskolin content was assessed using the HPTLC and HPLC.

MethodsFive populations of Coleus forskohlii collected from five locations of varying altitude from Uttarakhand, India. The plant roots were extracted with methanol by soxhlet extraction. The metabolic diversity was analyzed by employing HPTLC fingerprinting while forskolin was extracted and quantified by HPLC.

ResultsSignificant differences were observed in the phytochemical composition through the HPTLC chromatograms among the studied population across the altitudes. The Gopeshwar population (1488m) showed highest number of bands on HPTLC chromatogram each of which corresponds to acompound. Results of HPLC shows differences in forskolin quantity in studied populations and the Piaplkoti population(1339m) showed highest forskolin accumulation.

ConclusionThe present study confirms that altitude and changing environment affects the nature and quantity of secondary metabolites in C. forskohlii and the environmental conditions might be instrumental factor for intraspecific metabolic diversity. The Pipalkoti (1339m) and Gopeshwar (1488m) populations were found suitable for the forskolin production as well as other metabolites and these two populations can be propagated for commercial use.","NA"

A substantial amount of data demonstrates that chronic neuroinflammation can accelerate neurodegenerative pathologies, while epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that the use of anti-inflammatory agents may be neuroprotective. In AD, chronic neuroinflammation results in the upregulation of cyclooxygenase and increased production of prostaglandin H2, a precursor for many vasoactive prostanoids. While it is well-established that many prostaglandins can modulate the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, the role of prostacyclin (PGI2) in the brain is poorly understood. We have conducted studies to assess the effect of elevated prostacyclin biosynthesis in a mouse model of AD. Upregulated prostacyclin expression significantly worsened multiple measures associated with amyloid disease pathologies. Mice overexpressing both amyloid and PGI2 exhibited impaired learning and memory and increased anxiety-like behavior compared with non-transgenic and PGI2 control mice. PGI2 overexpression accelerated the development of amyloid accumulation in the brain and selectively increased the production of soluble amyloid-{beta} 42. PGI2 damaged the microvasculature through alterations in vascular length and branching; amyloid expression exacerbated these effects. Our findings demonstrate that chronic prostacyclin expression plays a novel and unexpected role that hastens the development of the AD phenotype.","NA"

We use the bioassay to measure degradation half-lives of the {beta}-lactam antibiotics mecillinam, aztreonam and cefotaxime in widely-used bacterial growth media based on MOPS and Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. We find that mecillinam degradation can occur rapidly, with a half-life as short as 2 hours in MOPS medium at 37{degrees}C and pH 7.4, and 4-5 hours in LB, but that adjusting the pH and temperature can increase its stability to a half-life around 6 hours without excessively perturbing growth.

However, FPE also increases with absolute latitude, precipitation and (all else equal) with temperature. The temperature effect is opposite to what would be expected based on the short-term physiological response of respiration rates to temperature. It implies top-down regulation of forest carbon loss, perhaps reflecting the higher carbon costs of nutrient acquisition in colder climates. Current ecosystem models do not reproduce this phenomenon.

We previously demonstrated how the explosive phenotypic diversification of East African cichlids is attributed to diverse molecular mechanisms, including accelerated regulatory sequence evolution and gene expression divergence. To investigate these mechanisms across species at a genome-wide scale, our novel network-based approach identifies ancestral and extant gene co-expression modules along a phylogeny, and by integrating associated regulators, predicts candidate regulatory regions implicated in traits under selection in cichlids. As a case study, we present data from a well-studied adaptive trait - the visual system - for which we report striking cases of network rewiring for visual opsin genes, identify discrete regulatory variants, and investigate the plausibility of their association with cichlid visual system evolution. In regulatory regions of visual opsin genes, in vitro assays confirm that transcription factor binding site mutations disrupt regulatory edges across species, and segregate according to lake species phylogeny and ecology, suggesting GRN rewiring in radiating cichlids.

Currently, the use alternative growth promoters is increasing and more information is needed on their capability to select for antimicrobial resistance. We investigated the impact of different growth promoters on the pig fecal resistome and microbiome. The growth promoters were carbadox (antibiotic), copper sulfate and zinc oxide (metal) or mushroom powder (natural product). Six pens of seven weanling piglets per treatment were used in a 33-day growth trial. Fecal samples were taken from one median weight female and male pig per pen, samples from the same pen were pooled, and DNA was isolated. Relative antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) and mobile genetic element (MGE) abundances were measured using high-throughput qPCR array with 382 primers and the bacterial community composition was investigated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Only modest changes were observed in community structure and resistome in response to growth promoters, but more ARGs were co-occurring with MGEs in growth promoter group samples than in the control group samples. The taxonomic structure could not be linked to resistome structure in the growth promoter groups. These results suggest that horizontal gene transfer might be more important mechanism in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in response to growth promotion than the selection of resistant bacteria. Thus, ARG mobility should be taken into account when designing new antimicrobial use policies and antimicrobial resistance surveillances.

ImportanceDue to increasing antimicrobial drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria, international health organizations are advising livestock and poultry industries to limit the use of antimicrobials in growth promotion. Together with growing consumer concerns regarding antimicrobial use in animal agriculture, markets are favorable to alternative growth promoters. Since the interest towards enhancing animal productivity and health through microbiome approaches is also increasing, it is important to study the linkages between the resistome and bacterial community structure to avoid enriching ARGs in animal microbiomes. Our study explores the influences of different growth promoters on the bacterial community and resistome compositions and we show that replacing the use of antibiotics with alternative growth promoters is probably an insufficient antibiotic resistance mitigation strategy and that resistance gene mobility might be an underestimated factor in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance through animal agriculture.","NA"

Loss of MBNL protein function through sequestration by CUG or CCUG RNA repeats is largely responsible for the phenotypes of the human genetic disorder myotonic dystrophy (DM). We generated the first stable zebrafish (Danio rerio) models of DM-associated MBNL loss of function through mutation of the three zebrafish mbnl genes. In contrast to mouse models, zebrafish double and triple homozygous mbnl mutants were viable to adulthood. Zebrafish mbnl mutants displayed disease-relevant physical phenotypes including decreased body size and impaired movement. They also exhibited widespread alternative splicing changes, including the misregulation of many DM-relevant exons. Physical and molecular phenotypes were more severe in compound mbnl mutants than in single mbnl mutants, suggesting partially redundant functions of Mbnl proteins. The high fecundity and larval optical transparency of this complete series of zebrafish mbnl mutants will make them useful for studying DM-related phenotypes and how individual Mbnl proteins contribute to them, and for testing potential therapeutics.","NA"

ACT-iPSC-CM generated from individuals with CD20+ B-cell lymphoma cancer who had received high doses of DOX and suffered cardiac dysfunction were observed to be persistently more susceptible to DOX toxicity compared to control-iPSC-CM. ACT-iPSC-CM exhibited increased DOX-dependent disorganized myofilament structure and cell death, as well as higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to controls. Importantly, analysis of engineered heart muscle (EHM) from ACT-iPSC-CM showed an impaired DOX-dependent mechanical functionality. Transcriptome profiles of EHM are in line with a disturbed adjustment to DOX-dependent alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis in ACT-iPSC-CM. Furthermore, genetic variants in different cardiac key regulators were uncovered.

In conclusion, we developed the first human iPSC-CM and EHM model of DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction in patients with B-cell lymphoma. Our results suggest that DOX-related stress resulted in decreased contractile activity and finally in heart failure in ACT patients.

Some important factors that determine shoal choice are shoal size, familiarity and species composition. However, individuals and species often exhibit distinct shoaling preferences. Individual differences in shoaling preferences may also be related to personality traits such as boldness and sociability. In this study, we examined the link between shoaling decisions and personality traits in a hatchery reared population of an endangered megafish, the Deccan Mahseer (Tor khudree). We found that this fish exhibits a distinct preference for larger shoals at ratios of 1:2 or greater. However, they did not prefer to associate with an isolated familiar individual over unfamiliar ones or with a member of their own species over an invasive species. Moreover, shoaling preferences in individuals did not correlate with their boldness or sociability. These results suggest that hatchery reared mahseers which are reintroduced into natural habitats may shoal with invasive species, negatively affecting their viability. Modifying social behaviour of mahseers by amending rearing practices may be a useful strategy to improve outcomes of restocking interventions.","NA"

Multi-modal analyses of both microbes and host cells in a spatially-resolved fashion would enable studies into these complex interactions in native tissue environments, potentially in clinical specimens. While techniques to preserve each of the microbial and host cell compartments have been used to examine tissues and microbes separately, we endeavored to develop approaches to simultaneously analyze both compartments. Herein, we established an original method for mucus preservation using Poloxamer 407 (also known as Pluronic F-127), a thermoreversible polymer with mucus-adhesive characteristics. We demonstrate that this approach can preserve spatially-defined compartments of the mucus bi-layer in the colon and the bacterial communities within, compared with their marked absence when tissues were processed with traditional formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pipelines. Additionally, antigens for antibody staining of host cells were preserved and signal intensity for 16S rRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was enhanced in Poloxamer-fixed samples. This in turn enabled us to integrate multi-modal analysis using a modified multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) protocol. Importantly, we have formulated Poloxamer 407 to polymerize and crosslink at room temperature for use in clinical workflows. These results suggest that the fixative formulation of Poloxamer 407 can be integrated into biospecimen collection pipelines for simultaneous analysis of microbes and host cells.","NA"

The strength of the stalk rind, commonly measured as rind penetrometer resistance (RPR), is an important contributor to stalk lodging resistance. To enhance RPR genetic architecture, we conducted selection mapping on populations developed by 15 cycles of divergent selection for high (C15-H) and low (C15-L) RPR. We also performed time-course transcriptome and metabolic analyses on developing stalks of high (Hrpr1) and low (Lrpr1) RPR inbred lines derived from the C15-H and C15-L populations, respectively. Divergent selection significantly altered allele frequencies at 3,656 and 3,412 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the C15-H and C15-L populations, respectively. While the majority of the SNPs under selection were unique, 110 SNPs were common in both populations indicating the fixation of alleles with alternative effects. Remarkably, preferential selection on the genomic regions associated with lignin and polysaccharide biosynthesis genes was observed in C15-H and C15-L populations, respectively. This observation was supported by higher lignification and lower extractability of cell wall-bound sugars in Hrpr1 compared to Lrpr1. Tricin, a monolignol important for incorporation of lignin in grass cell walls, emerged as a key determinant of the different cell wall properties of Hrpr1 and Lrpr1. Integration of selection mapping with transcriptomics and previous genetic studies on RPR identified 40 novel candidate genes including ZmMYB31, ZmNAC25, ZmMADS1, two PAL paralogues, two lichenases, ZmEXPA2, ZmIAA41, and Caleosin.

Rtf1 function requires phosphorylation of Spt5, an essential RNAPII processivity factor. Spt5 is phosphorylated within its C-terminal domain (CTD) by cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9), catalytic component of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). Rtf1 recognizes phosphorylated Spt5 (pSpt5) through its Plus3 domain. Since Spt5 is a unique target of Cdk9, and Rtf1 is the only known pSpt5-binding factor, the Plus3/pSpt5 interaction is thought to be a key Cdk9-dependent event regulating RNAPII elongation. Here we dissect Rtf1 regulation by pSpt5 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We demonstrate that the Plus3 domain of Rtf1 (Prf1 in S. pombe) and pSpt5 are functionally distinct, and that they act in parallel to promote Prf1 function. This alternate Plus3 domain function involves an interface that overlaps with the pSpt5 binding site and that can interact with single-stranded nucleic acid or with the Polymerase Associated Factor (PAF) Complex in vitro. We further show that the C-terminal region of Prf1, which also interacts with PAF, has a similar parallel function with pSpt5.

Ubiquitously expressed chromatin regulators modulate these networks, yet the mechanisms governing how tissue-specificity of their function is achieved are poorly understood. BRD4, a member of the BET (Bromo- and Extra-Terminal domain) family of ubiquitously expressed acetyl-lysine reader proteins, plays a pivotal role as a coactivator of enhancer signaling across diverse tissue types in both health and disease, and has been implicated as a pharmacologic target in heart failure. However, the cell-specific role of BRD4 in adult cardiomyocytes remains unknown. Here, we show that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of BRD4 in adult mice leads to acute deterioration of cardiac contractile function with mutant animals demonstrating a transcriptomic signature enriched for decreased expression of genes critical for mitochondrial energy production. Genome-wide occupancy data show that BRD4 enriches at many downregulated genes and preferentially co-localizes with GATA4, a lineage determining cardiac transcription factor not previously implicated in regulation of adult cardiac metabolism. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that BRD4 and GATA4 form a complex in a bromodomain-independent manner, revealing a new interaction partner for BRD4 that has functional consequences for target transactivation and may allow for locus and tissue specificity. These results highlight a novel role for a BRD4-GATA4 module in cooperative regulation of a cardiomyocyte specific gene program governing bioenergetic homeostasis in the adult heart.","NA"

This gene is most well known for its role in regulating blood pressure. But in recent times, its drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community because it may also serve as a doorway of sorts, enabling viruses like SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells. Our researchers looked at the ACE2 gene in more than 200,000 people, comparing their exact DNA sequences to see where there are differences among people. Variation in the DNA sequence of a gene is common and is sometimes meaningless. But other times, small changes in the DNA sequence can alter the protein that is made from that gene. In this case the ACE2 gene makes the ACE2 protein, which is what the SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with. We found a lot of variation between individuals and checked to see if that variation coincided with any traits (i.e., people with variant X tend to have high blood pressure more often than people without variant X). All of the traits we looked at were non-COVID-19-related traits, meaning we havent asked these people anything about COVID-19 yet (this is because these DNA sequences were collected before the pandemic).

We found that there are a number of variations observed among people in a specific part of the ACE2 gene. These variations are expected to alter the shape or functionality of a specific part of the ACE2 protein: The part that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We dont yet know what the real-life significance of this variation is, but its possible that these variants decrease the proteins ability to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thus decreasing the persons likelihood of being infected. We can speculate that there will be a spectrum of vulnerability to COVID-19 among people, where some people are more vulnerable than others, and that variants in this part of the ACE2 gene may be one of the reasons. The research we presented here shines a light on this part of the ACE2 gene and may give future researchers a direction to go in as they try to figure out what makes people vulnerable to COVID-19 and similar viruses.","NA"

In this circuit, a main sensory neuron class sends parallel outputs to several interneuron classes. We found that the removal of one of these interneuron classes impairs chemotaxis to attractive odors, revealing a prominent path for information flow in the circuit. To alleviate these deficiencies, we sought to reinforce a remaining neural pathway. We used genetically engineered electrical synapses for this purpose, and observed the successful recovery of chemotaxis performance. However, we were surprised to find that the recovery was largely mediated by inadvertently formed left-right lateral electrical connections within individual neuron classes. Our analysis suggests that these additional electrical synapses help restore circuit function by amplifying weakened neuronal signals in the damaged circuit.

We characterized both linear and threshold relationships between topographic and edaphic variables and SLA and developed a conceptual model of these relationships. We found that the depth of the soil active layer above permafrost was significantly and positively correlated with SLA for both coniferous and deciduous boreal tree species. Intraspecific SLA variation was associated with a fivefold increase in net primary production, suggesting that changes in active layer depth due to permafrost thaw could strongly influence ecosystem productivity. While this is an exploratory study to begin understanding SLA variation in a non-contiguous permafrost system, our results indicate the need for more extensive evaluation across larger spatial domains.

Obstruction of tear drainage causes a range of ocular surface disorders. Hitherto, genetics of tear duct development and obstruction has been scarcely explored. Here we report that a severe Prickle 1 hypomorph mouse line exhibited epiphora. This phenotype was due to blockage of the tear drainage by the incompletely formed nasolacrimal duct (NLD) and lacrimal canaliculi (CL). Further analysis revealed that the precocious eyelid opening, previously observed in the same type of Prickle 1 mutants, is also caused by tear duct dysplasia. A comparison of wild type, the Prickle 1 hypomorph and null mutants revealed a dose-dependent requirement of Prickle 1 for tear duct outgrowth. As a key component of a set of six Wnt/PCP core proteins, Prickle 1 usually works together with other PCP components. An investigation of expression of Wnt/PCP core genes demonstrated three of the six PCP components in tear duct, supporting the notion of context-dependent organization of PCP protein complexes. Furthermore, expression of Fgfr2/Fgf10 and p63 genes, mutations of which are associated with NLD and CL hypoplasia in human, were not altered in Prickle 1 mutant mice.

Recently, splicing of elncRNAs was shown to be associated with elevated enhancer activity. However, whether splicing of elncRNA transcripts is a mere consequence of accessibility at highly active enhancers or if elncRNA splicing directly impacts enhancer function, remains unanswered.

We analysed genetically driven changes in elncRNA expression, in humans, to address this outstanding question. We showed that splicing related motifs within multi-exonic elncRNAs evolved under selective constraints during human evolution, suggesting the processing of these transcripts is unlikely to have resulted from transcription across spurious splice sites. Using a genome-wide and unbiased approach, we used nucleotide variants as independent genetic factors to directly assess the causal relationship that underpin elncRNA splicing and their cognate enhancer activity. We found that the splicing of most elncRNAs is associated with changes in chromatin signatures at cognate enhancers and target mRNA expression.

We conclude that efficient and conserved processing of enhancer-associated elncRNAs contributes to enhancer activity.","NA"

COVID-19-associated deaths are mainly attributed to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Recent work demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lung. To better understand ACE2 abundance and expression patterns in the lung we interrogated our in-house single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset containing 70,085 EPCAM+ lung epithelial cells from paired normal and lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a diverse repertoire of airway lineages that included alveolar type I and II, bronchioalveolar, club/secretory, quiescent and proliferating basal, ciliated and malignant cells as well as rare populations such as ionocytes. While the fraction of lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 was low (1.7% overall), alveolar type II (AT2, 2.2% ACE2+) cells exhibited highest levels of ACE2 expression among all cell subsets. Further analysis of the AT2 compartment (n = 27,235 cells) revealed a number of genes co-expressed with ACE2 that are important for lung pathobiology including those associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; HHIP), pneumonia and infection (FGG and C4BPA) as well as malarial/bacterial (CD36) and viral (DMBT1) scavenging which, for the most part, were increased in smoker versus light or non-smoker cells. Notably, DMBT1 was highly expressed in AT2 cells relative to other lung epithelial subsets and its expression positively correlated with ACE2. We describe a population of ACE2-positive AT2 cells that co-express pathogen (including viral) receptors (e.g. DMBT1) with crucial roles in host defense thus comprising plausible phenotypic targets for treatment of COVID-19.","NA"

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air (via respiratory droplets and/or aerosols) between ferrets. Intranasal inoculation of donor ferrets resulted in a productive upper respiratory tract infection and long-term shedding, up to 11 to 19 days post-inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 transmitted to four out of four direct contact ferrets between 1 and 3 days after exposure and via the air to three out of four independent indirect recipient ferrets between 3 and 7 days after exposure. The pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets was similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus was isolated from all positive animals, showing that ferrets were productively infected via either route.

Several virulence factors participate in this process, including the open reading frame (ORF) BAB1_0270 codifying of a Zinc-dependent metalloproteinase. Here, its contribution in the process of intracellular adaptation was analyzed by infecting RAW264.7 macrophages with the mutant B. abortus {Delta}270 strain. Results showed that this Zinc-dependent metalloproteinase is a cytoplasmic protein that conforms an operon with a transcriptional regulator, which may constitute a type II toxin-antitoxin system. Functionally, this Zinc-dependent metalloproteinase participated neither in the adherence nor the initial intracellular traffic of B. abortus in macrophages. Nevertheless, its deletion significantly increased the co-localization of B. abortus {Delta}270 with phagolysosomal cathepsin D, reducing both its co-localization with calnexin, present in endoplasmic reticulum derived vesicles, and its intracellular replication within macrophages. Besides, B. abortus {Delta}270-infected macrophages produced significantly higher levels of TNF-, IL-6, CD80 and CD86 than B. abortus 2308, even when several genes involved in virulence (vjbR, hutC, bvrR, virB1) were up-regulated in this mutant. Finally, its deletion significantly reduced the capacity of B. abortus {Delta}270 to adapt, grow and express several virulence factors under acidic conditions. Based on these results, we discuss the role of this Zinc-dependent metalloproteinase in the regulation of the virulence of this pathogen, concluding that it contributes significantly to the intracellular adaptation of B. abortus 2308 during the infection of macrophages.

Author summaryBrucella abortus is the causative agent of the brucellosis, a highly contagious diseases. A Zinc-dependent metalloproteinase contributes significantly in the intracellular survival. Here, we demonstrate that this metalloproteinase has homology with ImmA/IrrE proteases, which are involved in the bacterial resistance to hostile environment. Furthermore, it conforms a gene pair with a transcriptional regulator, being required by B. abortus to escape from phagolysosomes, to achieve the endoplasmic reticulum and replicate within macrophages. Its deletion from B. abortus stimulated the macrophages, which produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory proteins. This pathogen showed a reduced ability to adapt and grow under acidic conditions, which would negatively affect its escape from phagolysosomes and consequently, stimulating macrophages. Therefore, this work describes how this Zinc-dependent metalloproteinase significantly contributes in the intracellular adaptation of B. abortus 2308 in macrophages.","NA"

Monocytes and macrophages play an important role in CMV dissemination from the site of infection to target organs. Moreover, macrophages are specialized in pathogen sensing and respond to infection by secreting cytokines and interferons. In murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a model for human cytomegalovirus, several genes required for efficient replication in macrophages have been identified, but their specific functions remain poorly understood. Here we show that MCMV m139, a gene of the conserved US22 gene family, encodes a protein that interacts with the DEAD box helicase DDX3, a protein involved in pathogen sensing and interferon (IFN) induction, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5. DDX3 and UBR5 also participate in the transcription, processing, and translation of a subset of cellular mRNAs. We show that m139 inhibits DDX3-mediated IFN-{beta} induction and is necessary for efficient viral replication in bone-marrow derived macrophages. In vivo, m139 is crucial for viral dissemination to local lymph nodes and to the salivary glands. An m139-deficient MCMV also replicated to lower titers in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. This replication defect was not accompanied by increased IFN-{beta} transcription, but was rescued by knockout of either DDX3 or UBR5. Moreover, m139 co-localized with DDX3 and UBR5 in viral replication compartments in the cell nucleus. These results suggest that m139 inhibits DDX3-mediated IFN-{beta} production in macrophages and antagonizes DDX3 and UBR5-dependent functions related to RNA metabolism in endothelial cells.

Author SummaryHuman cytomegalovirus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes severe infections in immunocompromised individuals. The virus infects certain types, such as macrophages and endothelial cells, to ensure its dissemination within the body. Little is known about the viral factors that promote a productive infection of these cell types. The identification of critical viral factors and the molecular pathways they target can lead to the development of novel antiviral treatment strategies. Using the mouse cytomegalovirus as a model, we studied the viral m139 gene, which is important for virus replication in macrophages and endothelial cells and for dissemination in the mouse. This gene encodes a protein that interacts with the host proteins DDX3 and UBR5. Both proteins are involved in gene expression, and the RNA helicase DDX3 also participates in mounting an innate antiviral response. By interacting with DDX3 and UBR5, m139 ensures efficient viral replication in endothelial cells. Importantly, we identify m139 as a new viral DDX3 inhibitor, which curtails the production of interferon in macrophages.","NA"

The objective of this work was to evaluate the validity of the diagnosis of HBV in blood banks, based on studies published in the world scientific literature from 2000 to 2018.

MethodsWe used a Meta-analysis of random effects with application of a search and selection protocol according to Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Reproducibility, completeness and quality assessment were affirmed with QUADAS, a tool for assessing diagnostics. The parameters of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, odds ratio and ROC curve were analyzed in MetaDisc with 95% confidence.

ResultsFrom 4,061 studies screened, only 12 complied with the protocol, and the compliant studies included a population of 17,391 healthy people and 1,229 infected. The compliant studies evaluated mainly immunodiagnostics (ELISA) using HB surface antigen (HBsAg) and less frequently anti-HBc (HB core antigen) and PCR. The tests for HBsAg presented sensitivity of 94.1% (95% CI = 92.9% - 95.1%), specificity 98.2% (95% CI = 97.8% - 98.6%), diagnostic OR of 1721 (95% CI = 607.18 - 4418.8) and Area Under the Curve of 99.7%.

BepC was initially reported to act in concert with BepF in triggering major actin cytoskeletal rearrangements that result in the internalization of a large bacterial aggregate by the so-called  invasome. Later, infection studies with bepC deletion mutants and ectopic expression of BepC have implicated this effector in triggering an actin-dependent cell contractility phenotype characterized by fragmentation of migrating cells due to deficient rear detachment at the trailing edge, and BepE was shown to counterbalance this remarkable phenotype. However, the molecular mechanism of how BepC triggers cytoskeletal changes and the host factors involved remained elusive. Using infection assays, we show here that T4SS-mediated transfer of BepC is sufficient to trigger stress fiber formation in non-migrating epithelial cells and additionally cell fragmentation in migrating endothelial cells. Interactomic analysis revealed binding of BepC to a complex of the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 and the serine/threonine-protein kinase MRCK. Knock-out cell lines revealed that only GEF-H1 is required for mediating BepC-triggered stress fiber formation and inhibitor studies implicated activation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway downstream of GEF-H1. Ectopic co-expression of tagged versions of GEF-H1 and BepC truncations revealed that the C-terminal  Bep intracellular delivery (BID) domain facilitated anchorage of BepC to the plasma membrane, whereas the N-terminal  filamentation induced by cAMP (FIC) domain facilitated binding of GEF-H1. While FIC domains typically mediate post-translational modifications, most prominently AMPylation, a mutant with quadruple amino acid exchanges in the putative active site indicated that the BepC FIC domain acts in a non-catalytic manner to activate GEF-H1. Our data support a model in which BepC activates the RhoA/ROCK pathway by re-localization of GEF-H1 from microtubules to the plasma membrane.

Author SummaryA wide variety of bacterial pathogens evolved numerous virulence factors to subvert cellular processes in support of a successful infection process. Likewise, bacteria of the genus Bartonella translocate a cocktail of effector proteins (Beps) via a type-IV-secretion system into infected cells in order to interfere with host signaling processes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, apoptosis control, and innate immune responses. In this study, we demonstrate that BepC triggers actin stress fiber formation and a linked cell fragmentation phenotype resulting from distortion of rear-end retraction during cell migration. The ability of BepC to induce actin stress fiber formation is directly associated with its ability to bind GEF-H1, an activator of the RhoA pathway that is sequestered in an inactive state when bound to microtubules, but becomes activated upon release to the cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that BepC is anchored via its BID domain to the plasma membrane where it recruits GEF-H1 via its FIC domain, eventually activating the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway and leading to stress fiber formation.","NA"

MATERIALS AND METHODSONCOhabitats open web service was used to obtain the cerebral blood volume at the infiltrated peripheral edema for MRI studies of 50 glioblastoma patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive: TCGA-GBM. ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were carried out in order to assess the association between vascular features and the subtypes. For assessing specific differences, Mann-Whitney U-test was conducted. Finally, the association of overall survival with molecular and vascular features was assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox models.

RESULTSANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests for the maximum cerebral blood volume at the infiltrated peripheral edema between the four subclasses yielded false discovery rate corrected p-values of <0.001 and 0.02, respectively. This vascular feature was significantly higher (p=0.0043) in proneural patients compared to the rest of the subtypes while conducting Mann-Whitney U-test. The multivariate Cox model pointed to redundant information provided by vascular features at the peripheral edema and proneural subtype when analyzing overall survival.

In the current work, there were no statistically significant differences in key echocardiographic parameters between male and female C57Bl/6 mice in response to acute adrenergic stimulation. After chronic adrenergic stimulation, there was similar degree of cardiac dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis in male and female mice. Similarly, chronic isoproterenol administration induced hypertrophic and fibrotic genes in hearts of male and female mice to the same extent. Intriguingly, gonadectomy of male and female mice did not have a significant impact on isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction as compared to sham-operated animals. The current work demonstrated lack of significant sex-related differences in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, dysfunction, and fibrosis in C57Bl/6 mice.

We tested the association of this summary measure for implementation strength with household data from the 2015 Malawi Demographic Health Survey (DHS). We found that areas with stronger implementation of FP programs had higher odds of women using modern contraceptives compared with areas with weaker implementation. The association of ISA with use of modern contraception was different by education, marital status, and geography. After controlling for these factors, we found that the adjusted odds of using a modern contraceptive was three times higher in catchment areas with high implementation strength compared to those with lower strength.

ConclusionMetrics that summarize how strongly FP programs are being implemented were used to show a statistically significantly positive relationship between increasing implementation strength and higher rates of modern contraceptive use. Decisionmakers at the various levels of health authority can use this type of summary measure to better understand the combined impact of their diverse FP programming and inform future programmatic and policy decisions. The findings also reinforce the idea that having a well-supported and supplied cadre of community health workers supplementing FP provision at the health facility can be an important health systems mechanism, especially in rural settings and to target youth populations.","NA"

Furthermore, available models describing growth are infrequently combined with computational approaches capable of handling large data sets. We apply a mechanistic model to evaluate whether selection of restored habitat can affect individual growth. We used mark-recapture to collect size and growth data on sub-yearling Chinook salmon and steelhead in restored and unrestored habitat in five sampling years (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2016). Modeling strategies differed for the two species: For Chinook, we compared growth patterns of individuals recaptured in restored habitat over 15-60 d with those not recaptured regardless of initial habitat at marking. For steelhead, we had enough recaptured fish in each habitat type to use the model to directly compare habitats. The model generated spatially explicit growth parameters describing size of fish over the growing season in restored vs. unrestored habitat. Model parameters showed benefits of restoration for both species, but that varied by year and time of season, consistent with known patterns of habitat partitioning among them. The model was also supported by direct measurement of growth rates in steelhead and by known patterns of spatio-temporal partitioning of habitat between these two species. Model parameters described not only the rate of growth, but the timing of size increases, and is spatially explicit, accounting for habitat differences, making it widely applicable across taxa. The model usually supported data on density differences among habitat types in Chinook, but only in a couple of cases in steelhead. Modeling growth can thus prevent overconfidence in distributional data, which are commonly used as the metric of restoration success.","NA"

Improved CAR T cell immunotherapy requires a better understanding of the interplay between CAR T cell doses and tumor burden, administration protocol, toxicity, resistance to immunotherapy, among other features. We developed a three-compartment mathematical model to describe tumor response to CAR T cell immunotherapy in immunodeficient mouse models. It encompasses interactions between tumor cells, effector and long-term memory CAR T cells such as tumor induced immunosuppression effects, conversion of memory T cells into effector T cells in the presence of tumor cells, and individual specificities considered as uncertainties in the parameters of the model. The model was able to represent two different immunotherapy scenarios with different CAR receptors and tumor targets reported in the literature. Further in silico studies considering different dosing quantities and tumor burden showed that the proposed model can represent the three possible therapy outcomes: tumor elimination, equilibrium, and escape. We found that therapy effectiveness may also depend on small variations in the parameter values, regarded as intrinsic individual specificities, as T cell proliferation capacity, as well as immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment factors. These issues may significantly reduce the chance of tumor elimination. In this way, the developed model provides potential use for assessing different CAR T cell protocols and associated efficacy without further in vivo experiments.","NA"

Mathematical modelling and simulations of evolutionary rescue in spatially or otherwise structured populations showed that intermediate migration rates can often maximize the probability of rescue in gradually or abruptly deteriorating habitats. These theoretical results corroborate the positive effect of gene flow on evolutionary rescue that has been identified in experimental yeast populations. The observations that gene flow can facilitate adaptation are in seeming conflict with traditional population genetics results that show that gene flow usually hampers (local) adaptation. Identifying conditions for when gene flow facilitates survival chances of populations rather than reducing them remains a key unresolved theoretical question. We here present a simple analytically tractable model for evolutionary rescue in a two-deme model with gene flow. Our main result is a simple condition for when migration facilitates evolutionary rescue, as opposed as no migration. We further investigate the roles of asymmetries in gene flow and / or carrying capacities, and the effects of density regulation and local growth rates on evolutionary rescue.","NA"

A formal justification for such continual evolution ultimately relies on the ""invasion implies substitution""-principle. Here, whenever a mutant allele causing a small phenotypic change can successfully invade a population, the ancestral (or wild-type) allele will be replaced, whereby fostering gradual phenotypic change if the process is repeated. It has been argued that this principle holds in a broad range of situations, including spatially and demographically structured populations experiencing frequency and density dependent selection under demographic and environmental fluctuations. However, prior studies have not been able to account for all aspects of population structure, leaving unsettled the conditions under which the ""invasion implies substitution""-principle really holds. In this paper, we start by laying out a program to explore and clarify the generality of the ""invasion implies substitution""-principle. Particular focus is given on finding an explicit and functionally constant representation of the selection gradient on a quantitative trait. Using geometric singular perturbation methods, we then show that the ""invasion implies substitution""-principle generalizes to well-mixed and scalar-valued polymorphic multispecies ecological communities that are structured into finitely many demographic (or physiological) classes. The selection gradient is shown to be constant over the evolutionary timescale and that it depends only on the resident phenotype, individual growth-rates, population steady states and reproductive values, all of which are calculated from the resident dynamics. Our work contributes to the theoretical foundations of evolutionary ecology.","NA"

Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource limited environments.

FindingsWe present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics which are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences, and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2.

Data, however, show that most of the known plasmids are non-transmissible. How are they maintained? Plasmid carriage costs are measured in competition assays between two microbes, with and without plasmid, where the cost is given by relative differences in growth rate. Here I report that plasmids change more traits than growth rate, and for some traits carrying plasmids can be beneficial. The growth dynamics of two constructs of Escherichia coli revealed that lag and yield are also sensitive to plasmid carriage. One of the constructs (R) bears a non-transmissible plasmid with a tetracycline-resistance gene. Its growth rate was, indeed, slower than its sensitive counterparts (S). But, crucially, it also attained higher yields. Since competition studies seek differences in growth rate only, the sensitivity of yield to plasmid carriage introduced unforeseen benefits: R-cells persisted alongside S in competition assays that favoured yield--without using tetracycline--for more than 80 generations. Importantly, determining the boundaries of  mutant selection windows follows identical rationale. Favouring yield meant R-cells were selected below the minimal selective concentration, suggesting that resistant mutants are selected with less exposure than previously thought. Thus, metrics that rely exclusively on growth rate, particularly density-independent growth rate such as fitness, may lead to unreliable predictions.","NA"

In contrast, its paralog, CTCFL is normally only present in testis. However, it is also aberrantly expressed in many cancers. While it is known that shared and unique zinc finger sequences in CTCF and CTCFL enable CTCFL to bind competitively to a subset of CTCF binding sites as well as its own unique locations, the impact of CTCFL on chromosome organization and gene expression has not been comprehensively analyzed in the context of CTCF function. Using an inducible complementation system, we analyze the impact of expressing CTCFL and CTCF-CTCFL chimeric proteins in the presence or absence of endogenous CTCF to clarify the relative and combined contribution of CTCF and CTCFL to chromosome organization and transcription.

ResultsWe demonstrate that the N terminus of CTCF interacts with cohesin which explains the requirement for convergent CTCF binding sites in loop formation. By analyzing CTCF and CTCFL binding in tandem we identify phenotypically distinct sites with respect to motifs, targeting to promoter/intronic intergenic regions and chromatin folding. Finally, we reveal that the N, C and zinc finger terminal domains play unique roles in targeting each paralog to distinct binding sites, to regulate transcription, chromatin looping and insulation.

ConclusionThis study clarifies the unique and combined contribution of CTCF and CTCFL to chromosome organization and transcription, with direct implications for understanding how their co-expression deregulates transcription in cancer.","NA"

Recently, Shh signaling components have been found to be expressed at the synaptic level in the postnatal brain, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of synaptic transmission. Using in utero electroporation of constitutively active and dominant-negative forms of the Shh co-receptor smoothened (Smo), we studied the role of Smo signaling in the development and maturation of GABAergic transmission in the somatosensory cortex. Our results show that enhancing Smo activity during development accelerates the shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA in dependence on functional expression of potassium-chloride cotransporter type 2 (KCC2). On the other hand, blocking Smo activity maintains GABA response in a depolarizing state in mature cortical neurons resulting in altered chloride homeostasis and increased seizure susceptibility. This study reveals an unexpected function of Smo signaling on the regulation of chloride homeostasis through the control of KCC2 cell surface stability and on the timing of the GABA inhibitory/excitatory shift in brain maturation.

Neuroimaging shows that beat perception strongly engages the motor system even in the absence of movement, but few efforts have been made to connect neurocomputational properties of the motor system to beat perception. Here we hypothesize three specific, interacting roles for the motor system in beat perception: predictive timing of beats by neuronal population clocks reset through the basal ganglias direct pathway, periodic motor facilitation by entrained hyperdirect pathway drive to basal ganglia, and balancing top-down and bottom-up influences on beat perception through striatal dopaminergic modulation. This leads to testable predictions about the motor systems contribution to auditory cognition.

HighlightsThe Action Simulation for Auditory Prediction (ASAP) hypothesis posits that covert anticipatory timing of a musical beat is performed by the motor system.

Beats may be anticipated by an adjustable-speed (""relative"") timer in the supplementary motor area, initiated and reset like a movement via the basal ganglia direct pathway.

Beta oscillations (known to fluctuate with the beat) may be an anti-kinetic ""hold"" signal that scaffolds motor entrainment and beat timer resetting.

The sliding clamp needs to be actively opened and installed onto DNA by a clamp loader ATPase of the AAA+ family. The human clamp loader Replication Factor C (RFC) and sliding clamp PCNA are both essential and play critical roles in several diseases. Despite decades of study, no structure of human RFC has been resolved. Here, we report the structure of human RFC bound to PCNA by cryo-EM to an overall resolution of ~3.4 [A]. The active sites of RFC are fully bound to ATP analogs, which is expected to induce opening of the sliding clamp. However, we observe the complex in a conformation prior to PCNA opening, with the clamp loader ATPase modules forming an over-twisted spiral that is incapable of binding DNA or hydrolyzing ATP. The autoinhibited conformation observed here has many similarities to a previous yeast RFC:PCNA crystal structure, suggesting that eukaryotic clamp loaders adopt a similar autoinhibited state early on in clamp loading. Our results point to a  Limited Change/Induced Fit mechanism in which the clamp first opens, followed by DNA binding inducing opening of the loader to release auto-inhibition. The proposed change from an over-twisted to an active conformation reveals a novel regulatory mechanism for AAA+ ATPases.

With the recent advancements in sequencing techniques, sufficient genomic data has become available to train models that predict the evolutionary statistical energies, but there is still inadequate experimental data to directly predict functional effects. One approach to overcome this data scarcity is to apply transfer learning and train more models with available datasets. In this study, we propose a set of transfer learning algorithms we call TLmutation, which implements a supervised transfer learning algorithm that transfers knowledge from survival data of a protein to a particular function of that protein. This is followed by an unsupervised transfer learning algorithm that extends the knowledge to a homologous protein. We explore the application of our algorithms in three cases. First, we test the supervised transfer on 17 previously published deep mutagenesis datasets to complete and refine missing datapoints. We further investigate these datasets to identify which mutations build better predictors of variant functions. In the second case, we apply the algorithm to predict higher-order mutations solely from single point mutagenesis data. Finally, we perform the unsupervised transfer learning algorithm to predict mutational effects of homologous proteins from experimental datasets. These algorithms are generalized to transfer knowledge between Markov random field models. We show the benefit of our transfer learning algorithms to utilize informative deep mutational data and provide new insights into protein variant functions. As these algorithms are generalized to transfer knowledge between Markov random field models, we expect these algorithms to be applicable to other disciplines.","NA"

Here, we find that APOBEC3A-mediated cellular RNA editing can also be induced by influenza or Maraba virus infections of normal human macrophages, and by interferons in tumor-associated macrophages. Gene knockdown and RNA_Seq analyses show that APOBEC3A mediates C>U RNA editing of 209 exonic/UTR sites in 203 genes during M1 polarization. The highest level of deleterious C>U RNA editing occurred in THOC5, encoding a nuclear mRNA export protein implicated in M-CSF-driven macrophage differentiation. Knockdown of APOBEC3A reduces pro-inflammatory M1 markers including IL6, IL23A and IL12B gene expression, CD86 surface protein expression, and TNF-, IL-1{beta} and IL-6 cytokine secretion, and increases glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Thus, APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase plays an important role in transcriptomic and functional polarization of M1 macrophages.","NA"

Another is for neurons to separately encode letter distortions and combinations. Here, we provide evidence for the latter using neural recordings in the monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex. Neurons encoded letter distortions as a product of letter and distortion tuning, and letter combinations as a sum of letters. These rules were sufficient for perfect CAPTCHA decoding and were also present in neural networks trained for word recognition.

Rapid and informed guidance of epidemic (research) responses to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires quick compilation and integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge. As a case study we chose the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that started in 2015 to develop a proof-of-concept knowledge repository. To extract data from available sources and build a computationally tractable and comprehensive molecular interaction map we applied generic knowledge management software for literature mining, expert knowledge curation, data integration, reporting and visualisation. A multi-disciplinary team of experts, including clinicians, virologists, bioinformaticians and knowledge management specialists, followed a pre-defined workflow for rapid integration and evaluation of available evidence. While conventional approaches usually require months to comb through the existing literature, the initial ZIKV KnowledgeBase (ZIKA KB) was completed within a few weeks. Recently we updated the ZIKA KB with additional curated data from the large amount of literature published since 2016 and made it publicly available through a web interface together with a step-by-step guide to ensure reproducibility of the described use case (S4). In addition, a detailed online user manual is provided to enable the ZIKV research community to generate hypotheses, share knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and interactively explore and interpret data (S5). A workflow for rapid response during outbreaks was generated, validated and refined and is also made available. The process described here can be used for timely structuring of pathophysiological knowledge for future threats. The resulting structured biological knowledge is a helpful tool for computational data analysis and generation of predictive models and opens new avenues for infectious disease research.

Author summaryDuring the recent ZIKV outbreak there was little information about the interactions between Zika virus and the host, however, the massive research response lead to a steep increase in the number of relevant publications within a very short period of time. At the time, there was no structured and comprehensive database available for integrated molecular and physiological data and knowledge about ZIKV infection. Researchers had to manually review the literature (amounting to over 5000 articles on ZIKV during our last update of the ZIKA KB in September 2018) to extract information about host-pathogen interaction and affected molecular, cellular and organ pathways. We explored the use of automated literature analysis and a defined cooperative effort between experts from various scientific, biomedical and information-technology domains to rapidly compile existing pathophysiological knowledge as a potential tool to support investigations during an emergency. This tool is contrasted with conventional approaches that would take months to comb through the massive amount of existing literature. In addition to providing background information for research, scientific publications can be processed to transform textual information into complex networks, which can be integrated with existing knowledge resources to suggest novel hypotheses that potentially contribute to innovative infectious disease research approaches. This study shows that the knowledge extraction and mapping process required to inform clinical and research responses to an emerging epidemic can be efficiently and effectively executed with a dedicated and trained group of experts, a validated process and the necessary tools. Our results further provide an overview of ZIKV biology, allow prediction of drug efficacy and indentify specific host factors and signalling pathways affected by ZIKV.","NA"

We describe the efficient isolation and characterization of cyclic peptide binders from genetically encoded combinatorial libraries using yeast surface display. Here, peptide cyclization is achieved by disuccinimidyl glutarate-mediated crosslinking of amine groups within a linear peptide sequence that is expressed as a yeast cell surface fusion. Using this approach, we first screened a library of cyclic heptapeptides by magnetic selection and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), to isolate binders for a model target (lysozyme) with low micromolar binding affinity (KD ~ 1.2 - 3.7 {micro}M). The isolated peptides bound lysozyme selectively, and only when cyclized. Importantly, we showed that yeast surface displayed cyclic peptides could be used to efficiently obtain quantitative estimates of binding affinity, without chemical synthesis of the selected peptides. Subsequently, to demonstrate broader applicability of our approach, we isolated cyclic heptapeptides that bind human interleukin-17 (IL-17) using yeast-displayed IL-17 as a target for magnetic selection, followed by FACS using recombinant IL-17. Molecular docking simulations and follow-up experimental analyses identified a candidate cyclic peptide that binds IL-17 in its receptor binding region with moderate affinity (KD ~ 300 nM). Taken together, our results show that yeast surface display can be used to efficiently isolate and characterize cyclic peptides generated by chemical modification from combinatorial libraries.","NA"

Full fat and defatted powder samples were prepared from non-fermented and fermented mealworm pastes. Then the crude protein, crude fat and dry matter contents, pH, bulk density, colour, water and oil binding capacity, foaming capacity and stability, emulsion capacity and stability, protein solubility, quantity of free amino groups and protein composition of the powders were evaluated. Regardless of the starter culture used, fermentation significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the crude and soluble protein content of the non-defatted mealworm powders and in general impaired their water and oil binding, foaming- and emulsifying properties. Defatting of the powders improved most functional properties studied, except the protein solubility, water binding capacity, foaming capacity and emulsion stability. The o-phthaldialdehyd assay revealed that the amount of free amino groups increased during fermentation, which may be attributed to proteolysis of mealworm proteins by the starters. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the soluble proteins of fermented powders were composed of molecules of lower molecular mass compared to non-fermented powders. As the molecular sizes of the soluble proteins decreased, it is clear that also the protein structure was modified by the fermentation process, which in turn led to changes in functional properties. It was concluded that fermentation of mealworms in general does not contribute to the functional properties studied in this work. Nevertheless, the results confirmed that the properties of non-fermented powders are comparable to other food protein sources.","NA"

Here, we show that on this platform ion mobility is beneficial for cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS). Cross-linking reagents covalently link amino acids in close proximity, resulting in peptide pairs after proteolytic digestion. These cross-linked peptides are typically present at low abundance in the background of normal peptides, which can partially be resolved by using enrichable cross-linking reagents. Even with a very efficient enrichable cross-linking reagent, like PhoX, the analysis of cross-linked peptides is still hampered by the co-enrichment of peptides connected to a partially hydrolyzed reagent - termed mono-linked peptides. For experiments aiming to uncover protein-protein interactions these are unwanted byproducts. Here, we demonstrate that gas-phase separation by ion mobility enables the separation of mono-linked peptides from cross-linked peptide pairs. A clear partition between these two classes is observed at a CCS of 500 [A]2 and a monoisotopic mass of 2 kDa, which can be used for targeted precursor selection. A total of 50 - 70% of the mono-linked peptides are prevented from sequencing, allowing the analysis to focus on sequencing the relevant cross-linked peptide pairs. In applications to both simple proteins and protein mixtures and a complete highly complex lysate this approach provides a substantial increase in detected cross-linked peptides.","NA"

We herein examined the cell viability, colony formation, cell migration, COX-2 reporter activity, the protein expressions of CXCR4, CXCL12, COX-2, VEGF, Caspase-3, BAX and Bcl-2. We have observed that the suppression of miR-144-3p significantly increased the cell proliferation and migration and decreased the apoptosis. Moreover, the downregulation of miR-144-3p markedly increased the COX-2, CXCR4, CXCL12 and VEGF expression in OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells.

Several studies have put forward putatively carcinogenic species in addition to Helicobacter pylori, but are not in perfect alignment, possibly due to variable parameters in the experiments, including downstream processing. Meta-analyses have not been published so far, so there is lack in clinical guidance beyond H. pylori eradication therapy.

MethodsHere, we analysed gastric mucosa samples from nine public data sets, including GC samples. Using both unsupervised and supervised learning, we defined fine grain bacterial networks of gastric mucosa and identified species associated with tumor status of samples.

ResultsWe found anatomic locations and cohort regions among the possible factors leading to the observation of study specific gastric microbiomes. Despite this variability, the periodontal species Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra and Peptostreptococcus stomatis were found in association with tumor status in several datasets. The three species were predicted to be in interaction by ecological network analysis and also formed the intersection of tumor associated species between four GC data sets and five colorectal cancer (CRC) data sets we reanalyzed. We formulated a probiotic composition putatively competing with the GC pathogen spectrum, from correlation analysis in a large superset of gut samples (n=17,800) from clinical- and crowd-sourced studies.

ImplicationsThe overlapping bacterial pathogen spectrum between two gastrointestinal tumor types, GC and CRC, has implications for etiology, treatment and prevention. In vitro testing results reported in literature suggest H. pylori eradication treatment should be efficient against the GC pathogen spectrum, yet the existence of an upstream periodontal reservoir is of concern. To address this, we propose longer term use of the formulated probiotics composition.","NA"

By tethering the TSC complex to lysosomes, G3BP1 suppresses signaling through the metabolic master regulator mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1). Like the known TSC complex subunits, G3BP1 suppresses phenotypes related to mTORC1 hyperactivity in the context of tumors and neuronal dysfunction.

We found that some MCCs undergo apoptosis, but that the majority trans-differentiate into secretory cells. Trans-differentiation involves loss of ciliary gene expression, cilia retraction and lysosomal degradation. Apoptosis and trans-differentiation are both induced by a changing signaling environment through Notch, Jak/STAT, Thyroid hormone and mTOR signaling, and trans-differentiation can be inhibited by Rapamycin. This demonstrates that even cells with extreme differentiation features can undergo direct fate conversion. Our data further suggest that the reactivation of this developmental mechanism in adults can drive tissue remodeling in human chronic airway disease, a paradigm resembling cancer formation and progression.","NA"

By comparing phenological metrics calculated from intensive systematic inventory data with those from opportunistic museum records for bee species spanning a range of functional traits, we explored biases and limitations of data types to determine best practices for bee monitoring and assessment. We compiled half a million records of wild bee occurrence from opportunistic museum collections and six systematic inventory efforts, focusing analyses on 45 well-represented species that spanned five functional traits: sociality, nesting habits, floral specialization, voltinism, and body size. We then used permutation tests to evaluate differences between data types in estimating three phenology metrics: flight duration, number of annual abundance peaks, and date of the highest peak. We used GLMs to test for patterns of data type significance across traits. All 45 species differed significantly in the value of at least one phenology metric depending on the data type used. The date of the highest abundance peak differed for 40 species, flight duration for 34 species, and the number of peaks for 15 species. The number of peaks was more likely to differ between data types for larger bees, and flight duration was more likely to differ for larger bees and specialist bees. Our results reveal a strong influence of data type on phenology metrics that necessitates consideration of data source when evaluating changes in phenological activity, possibly applicable to many taxa. Accurately assessing phenological change may require expanding wild bee monitoring and data sharing.","NA"

Here, we utilized a unique dataset of 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to study cross-species conservation of ACE2 and its likelihood to function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We designed a five-category ranking score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between receptor and virus, classifying all species from very high to very low. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories, and only catarrhine primates in the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 binding, and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (<0.1%) variants in 10/25 binding sites.

Thousands of cells from each colony were profiled both at early and late time points post-treatment in order to infer survival trajectories from initial drug tolerance to drug resistance. We find that prototrophic C. albicans populations differentially and stochastically express cytoprotective epigenetic programs. For all drugs, there is evidence that tolerant individuals partition into distinct subpopulations, each with a unique survival strategy involving different regulatory programs. These responses are weakly related to changes in morphology (shift from white to opaque forms, or shift from yeast to filamentous forms). In turn, those subpopulations that successfully reach resistance each have a distinct multivariate epigenetic response that coordinates the expression of efflux pumps, chaperones, transport mechanisms, and cell wall maintenance. Live cell fluorescent imaging was used to validate predictions of which molecular responses most often led to survival after drug exposure. Together our findings provide evidence that C. albicans has a robust toolkit of short-term epigenetic cytoprotective responses designed to ""buy time"" and increase the chance of acquiring long-term resistance.","NA"

IL-1{beta} induces neuronal hyperexcitability and is released under conditions of psychological stress and fever; both known triggers of clinical HSV reactivation. IL-1{beta} treatment of sympathetic neurons induced histone phosphorylation, and importantly HSV reactivation, which was dependent on both DLK and neuronal excitability. Thus, HSV co-opts an innate immune pathway resulting from IL-1 stimulation of sympathetic neurons to induce reactivation from latency.","NA"

Existing methods for detection of gastrointestinal colonization of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are limited to specific organisms or resistance mechanisms. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a more rapid and agnostic diagnostic approach for microbiome and resistome investigations. We determined if mNGS can detect MDRO from rectal swabs in concordance with standard microbiology results.

MethodsWe performed and compared mNGS performance on short-read Illumina MiSeq (N=10) and long-read Nanopore MinION (N=4) platforms directly from peri-rectal swabs to detect vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative organisms (CRO).

ResultsWe detected E. faecium (N=8) and E. faecalis (N=2) with associated van genes (9/10) in concordance with VRE culture-based results. We studied the microbiome and identified CRO organisms, P. aeruginosa (N=1), E. cloacae (N=1), and KPC-producing K. pneumoniae (N=1). Nanopore real-time detection detected the blaKPC gene in 2.5 minutes and provided genetic context (blaKPC harbored on pKPC_Kp46 IncF plasmid). Illumina sequencing provided accurate allelic variant determination (i.e., blaKPC-2) and strain typing of the K. pneumoniae (ST-15). Conclusions: We demonstrated an agnostic approach for surveillance of MDRO, examining advantages of both short and long-read mNGS methods for AMR detection.","NA"

Previous studies indicate that these motor sampling patterns modulate neuronal excitability in sensory brain regions by entraining brain rhythms, a process termed motor-initiated entrainment. Additionally, rhythms of the external environment, that are independent of internal motor commands, are also capable of entraining rhythmic brain activity. The goal of our study was twofold. First, we aimed to investigate the properties of motor-initiated entrainment in the auditory system using the most prominent motor sampling pattern in primates, eye movements. Second, we wanted to determine whether/how motor-initiated entrainment by eye movements interacts with visual environmental entrainment. By examining laminar profiles of neuronal ensemble activity in the primary auditory cortex of non-human primates, we found that while motor-initiated entrainment has a suppressive, visual environmental entrainment has an enhancive effect. We also found that the two processes are temporally coupled during free viewing, and their temporal relationship ensures that their effect on neuronal ensemble excitability is complementary rather than interfering. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that motor and sensory systems continuously interact in orchestrating the brains rhythmic context for the optimal sampling of our multisensory environment.","NA"

Animals licked to report the presence of the target sequence. Mice could respond to the earliest possible cues allowing discrimination, effectively solving the task as a  detection of change problem, but enhanced their performance when deliberating for longer. Optogenetic inactivation showed that both primary somatosensory  barrel cortex (S1bf) and secondary somatosensory cortex were necessary for sequence recognition. Two-photon imaging of calcium activity in S1bf layer 2/3 revealed that, in well-trained animals, neurons had heterogeneous selectivity to multiple task variables including not just sensory input but also the animals action decision and the trial outcome (presence or absence of a predicted reward). A large proportion of neurons were activated preceding goal-directed licking, thus reflecting the animals learnt response to the target sequence rather than the sequence itself; these neurons were found in S1bf as soon as mice learned to associate the rewarded sequence with licking. In contrast, learning evoked smaller changes in sensory responses: neurons responding to stimulus features were already found in naive mice, and training did not generate neurons with enhanced temporal integration or categorical responses. Therefore, in S1bf sequence learning results in neurons whose activity reflects the learnt association between the target sequence and licking, rather than a refined representation of sensory features.","NA"

Expression of Cx26DN in glial cells of a circumscribed region of the medulla -the caudal parapyramidal area - reduced the adaptive change in tidal volume and minute ventilation by approximately 30%. As central chemosensors mediate about 70% of the total response to hypercapnia, CO2-sensing via Cx26 contributed about 45% of the centrally-mediated ventilatory response to CO2.

Male offspring were bred with untreated female mice until the F3 generation was produced. Our results revealed that transient exposure of the F0 gestating female to arsenic can result in decreased sperm quality and histological abnormalities in testes of male offspring in the F1 and F3 generations.

We addressed this question in two subspecies of Clarkia xantiana (Onagraceae), California winter annuals that diverged approximately 65,000 years ago and that are adapted, partly by differences in flowering time, to native ranges that differ in precipitation.

MethodsIn these subspecies and in F5 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between them we scored drought-adaptation traits related to phenology (times to seed germination and to flowering) and tissue water relations (measures of succulence; pressure-volume curve parameters), in common environments.

ResultsSubspecies differed distinctly. The one native to more arid environments had some trait values associated with drought adaptation (e.g., early flowering and high succulence) but had higher osmotic potential at full turgor and lost turgor at higher water potential, indicating poorer tolerance of dehydration. Traits that differed between subspecies exhibited substantial genetic variation, with broad-sense heritability from 0.09 (stem succulence) to 0.43 (time to flowering). The genetic correlation structure suggests facilitated evolution of some trait combinations that might enhance drought adaptation (e.g., high succulence plus low turgor loss point), but the subspecies exhibit some trait combinations that do not follow genetic correlations.

ConclusionsAs lineages diverged in their potential to escape drought by early flowering, other traits diverged as well. Genetic architecture might facilitate some correlated evolutionary responses to drought, but particular trait combinations also can evolve despite apparent genetic constraints.","NA"

Increasing the spacer length beyond six nucleotides destabilizes mRNA-ribosome interactions and results in a 5-10 fold reduction of the translocation rate.

The first opportunity for a protein to fold occurs during translation, when the ribosome and surrounding environment can affect the energy landscape of the nascent chain. However, quantifying these environmental effects is challenging due to the ribosomal proteins and rRNA, which preclude most spectroscopic measurements of protein energetics. We have applied two gel-based approaches, pulse proteolysis and force-peptide arrest assays, to probe the folding and unfolding pathways of RNase H ribosome-stalled nascent chains. We find that ribosome-stalled RNase H has an increased unfolding rate compared to free RNase H, which completely accounts for observed changes in protein stability and indicates that the folding rate is unchanged. Using arrest peptide-based force-profile analysis, we assayed the force generated during the folding of RNase H on the ribosome. Surprisingly, we find that population of the RNase H folding intermediate is required to generate sufficient force to release the SecM stall and that readthrough of the stall sequence directly correlates with the stability of the folding intermediate. Together, these data imply that the folding pathway of RNase H is unchanged on the ribosome. Furthermore, our data indicate that the ribosome promotes unfolding while the nascent chain is proximal to the ribosome, which may limit the deleterious effects of misfolding and assist in folding fidelity.","NA"

However, the production of cement, which is used as a binding material in concrete, causes more than 5% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and has therefore a significant contribution to climate change and global warming. Due to increasing environmental awareness and international climate goals, there is a need for emission-reduced materials, that can replace conventional concrete in certain applications. One path to produce a solid, concrete-like construction material is microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). As a calcium source in MICP, crushed limestone, which mainly consists out of CaCO3, can be dissolved with acids, for example lactic acid. The pH evolution during crystallization and dissolution processes provides important information about kinetics of the reactions. However, previous research on MICP has mainly been focused on macro-scale pH evolution and on characterization of the finished material. To get a better understanding of MICP it is important to be able to follow also local pH changes in a sample. In this work we present a new method to study processes of MICP at micro-scale in situ and in real time. We present two different methods to monitor the pH changes during the precipitation process of CaCO3. In the first method, the average pHs of small sample volumes are measured in real time, and pH changes are subsequently correlated with processes in the sample by comparing to optical microscope results. The second method is introduced to follow local pH changes at a grain scale in situ and in real time. Furthermore, local pH changes during the dissolution of CaCO3 crystals are monitored. We demonstrate that these two methods are powerful tools to investigate pH changes for both MICP precipitation and CaCO3 dissolution for knowledge-based improvement of MICP-based material properties.

The high proportion of zero counts in a typical scRNA-seq data matrix has garnered particular attention, and lead to widespread but inconsistent use of terminology such as ""dropout"" and ""missing data."" Here, we argue that much of this terminology is unhelpful and confusing, and outline simple ways of thinking about models for scRNA-seq data that can help avoid this confusion. The key ideas are: (1) observed scRNA-seq counts reflect both the actual expression level of each gene in each cell and the measurement process, and it is important for models to explicitly distinguish contributions from these two distinct factors; and (2) the measurement process can be adequately described by a simple Poisson model, a claim for which we provide both theoretical and empirical support. We show how these ideas lead to a simple, flexible statistical framework that encompasses a number of commonly used models and analysis methods, and how this framework makes explicit their different assumptions and helps interpret their results.

Elastic-net regression was used to develop a DNA-methylation predictor of Pace of Aging, called DunedinPoAm for Dunedin (P)ace (o)f (A)ging (m)ethylation. Validation analyses showed DunedinPoAm was associated with functional decline in the Dunedin Study and more advanced biological age in the Understanding Society Study, predicted chronic disease and mortality in the Normative Aging Study, was accelerated by early-life adversity in the E-risk Study, and DunedinPoAm prediction was disrupted by caloric restriction in the CALERIE trial. DunedinPoAm generally outperformed epigenetic clocks. Findings provide proof-of-principle for DunedinPoAm as a single-time-point measure of a persons pace of biological aging.","NA"

Here we uncovered a specialized mode of Mec1/ATR signaling triggered by the extensive nucleolytic processing (resection) of DNA ends. Cells lacking RAD9, a checkpoint activator and an inhibitor of resection, exhibit a selective increase in Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of proteins associated with single strand DNA transactions, including the ssDNA binding protein Rfa2, the translocase/ubiquitin ligase Uls1 and the HR-regulatory Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 (STR) complex. Extensive Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of the STR complex, mostly on the Sgs1 helicase subunit, promotes an interaction between STR and the DNA repair scaffolding protein Dpb11. Fusion of Sgs1 to phosphopeptide-binding domains of Dpb11 strongly impairs HR-mediated repair, supporting a model whereby Mec1 signaling regulates STR upon hyper-resection to influence recombination outcomes. Overall, the identification of a distinct mode of Mec1 signaling triggered by hyper-resection highlights the multi-faceted action of this kinase in the coordination of checkpoint signaling and HR-mediated DNA repair.","NA"

One powerful means of transformation involves interactions between excitatory thalamocortical neurons that carry data to cortex and inhibitory neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) that regulate flow of those data3-6. Despite enduring recognition of the TRNs importance7-9, understanding of its cell types, their organization, and their functional properties has lagged that of the thalamocortical systems it controls.

Here we address this, investigating somatosensory and visual circuits of the TRN. First, in the somatosensory TRN we observed two groups of genetically defined neurons that are topographically segregated, physiologically distinct, and connect reciprocally with independent thalamocortical nuclei via dynamically divergent synapses. Calbindin-expressing cells, located in the central core, connect with the ventral posterior nucleus (VP), the primary somatosensory thalamocortical relay. In contrast, somatostatin-expressing cells, residing along the surrounding edges of TRN, synapse with the posterior medial thalamic nucleus (POM), a higher-order structure that carries both top-down and bottom-up information10-12. The two TRN cell groups process their inputs in pathway-specific ways. Synapses from VP to central TRN cells evoke rapid currents that depress deeply during repetitive activity, driving phasic spike output. In contrast, synapses from POM to edge TRN cells evoke slower, sustained currents that drive more persistent spiking. Differences in intrinsic physiology of TRN cell types, including state-dependent bursting, also contribute to these output dynamics. Thus, processing specializations of the two TRN circuits appear to be tuned to the types of signals they carry--the primary central circuit to discrete sensory events, and the higher-order edge circuit to temporally distributed signals integrated from multiple sources. Central and edge circuits of the visual TRN and their associated thalamocortical nuclei closely resemble those of the somatosensory circuits. These results provide fundamental insights about how subnetworks of TRN neurons could differentially process distinct classes of thalamic information.","NA"

Meanwhile, researchers increasingly employ multivariate predictive models that aggregate information across a large number of features to predict outcomes of interest, but the test-retest reliability of predicted outcomes of these models has not previously been systematically studied. Here we apply ten predictive modeling methods to resting state connectivity maps from the Human Connectome Project dataset to predict 61 outcome variables. Compared to mean reliability of individual resting state connections (0.44), we find mean reliability of the predicted outcomes of predictive models is higher for all ten methods. For the two most reliable methods, Brain Basis Set and Support Vector Regression, mean reliability of predicted outcomes was above 0.67, higher than the 0.60 threshold that is conventionally considered ""good"". We additionally identified three mechanisms that help to explain why predicted outcomes of predictive models have higher reliability than individual features.

The current study demonstrates that APP signals to the nucleus causing the generation of aggregates comprising its adapter protein FE65 and the tumour suppressor proteins p53 and PML. The PML nuclear body generation, known to be of relevance in virus defence and cell division, is induced and fusion occurs over time depending on APP signalling. We further show that the nuclear aggregates of APP C-terminal (APP-CT) fragments together with PML and FE65 are present in the aged human brain but not in cerebral organoids differentiated from iPS cells. Notably, human Alzheimers disease brains reveal a highly significant loss of these nuclear aggregates in areas with high plaque load compared to plaque-free areas of the same individual. Based on these results we conclude that APP-CT signalling to the nucleus takes place in the aged human brain and is potentially involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Taken the current knowledge on PML bodies into account, we hypothesize a new role for APP as a twofold virus response protein. The APP-dependent defence strategy includes A{beta}-virus interaction at the extracellular matrix and APP-CT driven PML aggregation in the nucleus to encapsulate the viral nucleic acid. This defence strategy preferentially occurs in high-plaque regions of the human brain and overstimulation of this pathway results in a pyrrhic victory.","NA"

To investigate the plant response to CLas, we enriched for proteins surrounding the phloem in an HLB susceptible sweet orange variety, Washington navel (Citrus sinensis (L) Osbeck). Quantitative proteomics revealed global changes in the citrus proteome after CLas inoculation. Plant metabolism and translation were suppressed, while defense-related proteins including proteases and protease inhibitors were induced in the vasculature. Specific serine proteases were upregulated in Washington navel in the presence of CLas based on quantitative proteomics. Subsequent activity-based protein profiling revealed genotype-specific variation in serine protease activity in other C. sinensis sweet orange varieties. Plant peroxidases involved in extracellular ROS production or scavenging were induced in vascular enriched tissues based on quantitative proteomics. While peroxidase transcript accumulation was induced in CLas infected sweet orange varieties, peroxidase enzymatic activity varied between varieties, supporting the genotype-specific regulation of enzymatic activity. The observations in the current study highlight dynamic global reprogramming of the citrus vascular proteome and genotype-specific regulation of different enzyme classes in response to CLas infection.

OBIF performs full factorial analysis of feature expression data from single vs. dual factor exposures to identify molecular clusters that reveal synergy-mediating pathways, functions and regulators. As a practical demonstration, OBIF analyzed a therapeutic dyad of immunostimulatory small molecules that induces synergistic protection against influenza A pneumonia. OBIF analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data identified biologically relevant, unanticipated cooperation between RelA and cJun that we subsequently confirmed to be required for the synergistic antiviral protection. To demonstrate generalizability, OBIF was applied to data from a diverse array of Omics platforms and experimental conditions, successfully identifying the molecular clusters driving their synergistic responses. Hence, OBIF is a phenotype-driven systems model that supports multiplatform exploration of synergy mechanisms.

Here, we report the generation of synthetic nanobodies, known as sybodies, against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. In an expeditious process taking only twelve working days, sybodies were selected entirely in vitro from three large combinatorial libraries, using ribosome and phage display. We obtained six strongly enriched sybody pools against the isolated RBD and identified 63 unique anti-RBD sybodies which also interact in the context of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It is anticipated that compact binders such as these sybodies could feasibly be developed into an inhalable drug that can be used as a convenient prophylaxis against COVID-19. Moreover, generation of polyvalent antivirals, via fusion of anti-RBD sybodies to additional small binders recognizing secondary epitopes, could enhance the therapeutic potential and guard against escape mutants.

Drosophila blood cells (hemocytes) are dominated by a lineage of cells considered to be the functional equivalents of mammalian macrophages (plasmatocytes). Until very recently plasmatocytes were thought to be a homogeneous population. Here, we identify enhancer elements that label subpopulations of plasmatocytes, which vary in abundance across the lifecourse of the fly. We demonstrate that these plasmatocyte subpopulations behave in a functionally-distinct manner when compared to the overall population, including more potent migratory responses to injury and decreased clearance of apoptotic cells within the developing embryo. Additionally, these subpopulations display differential localisation and dynamics in pupae and adults, hinting at the presence of tissue-resident macrophages in the fly. Our enhancer analysis also allows us to identify novel candidate genes involved in plasmatocyte behaviour in vivo. Misexpression of one such enhancer-linked gene (calnexin14D) in all plasmatocytes improves wound responses, causing the overall population to behave more like the subpopulation marked by the calnexin14D-associated enhancer. Finally, we show that, we are able to modulate the number of cells within some subpopulations via exposure to increased levels of apoptotic cell death, thereby decreasing the number of plasmatocytes within more wound-responsive subpopulations. Taken together our data demonstrates the existence of macrophage heterogeneity in Drosophila and identifies mechanisms involved in the specification and function of these plasmatocyte subpopulations. Furthermore, this work identifies key molecular tools with which Drosophila can be used as a highly genetically-tractable, in vivo system to study the biology of macrophage heterogeneity.","NA"

Cholesterol is a minor lipid component of chylomicrons; however, whether or not a shortage of cholesterol attenuates chylomicron assembly is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of NPC1L1 inhibition on trans-epithelial lipid transport, and chylomicron assembly and secretion in enterocytes. Caco-2 cells, an absorptive epithelial model, grown onto culture inserts were given lipid micelles from the apical side, and chylomicron-like triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein secreted basolaterally were analyzed after a 24-h incubation period in the presence of ezetimibe up to 50 M. The secretion of lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B48 were reduced by adding ezetimibe (30%, p<0.01 and 34%, p<0.05, respectively). Additionally, ezetimibe accelerated intracellular apoB protein degradation by approximately 2.8-fold and activated sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 by approximately 1.5-fold: These are indicators whether the cells are sensing cellular cholesterol shortage. Thus, ezetimibe appeared to limit cellular cholesterol mobilization required for lipoprotein assembly. In such conditions, large lipid droplet formation in Caco-2 cells and the enterocytes in mice were induced, implying that unprocessed triglyceride was sheltered in these compartments. Although ezetimibe did not reduce the post-prandial lipid surge appreciably in triolein-infused mice, the results of the present study indicated that NPC1L1-mediated supply chylomicron with cholesterol may participate in a novel regulatory mechanism for the efficient chylomicron assembly and secretion.","NA"

We sought to identify nanostructural properties that predispose nanoparticles to accumulate in pulmonary marginated neutrophils, and therefore to target severely inflamed lungs. We designed a library of nanoparticles and conducted an in vivo screen of biodistributions in naive mice and mice treated with lipopolysaccharides. We found that supramolecular organization of protein in nanoparticles predicts uptake in inflamed lungs. Specifically, nanoparticles with agglutinated protein (NAPs) efficiently home to pulmonary neutrophils, while protein nanoparticles with symmetric structure (e.g. viral capsids) are ignored by pulmonary neutrophils. We validated this finding by engineering protein-conjugated liposomes that recapitulate NAP targeting to neutrophils in inflamed lungs. We show that NAPs can diagnose acute lung injury in SPECT imaging and that NAP-like liposomes can mitigate neutrophil extravasation and pulmonary edema arising in lung inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that ischemic ex vivo human lungs selectively take up NAPs, illustrating translational potential. This work demonstrates that structure-dependent interactions with neutrophils can dramatically alter the biodistribution of nanoparticles, and NAPs have significant potential in detecting and treating respiratory conditions arising from injury or infections.","NA"

The most severe cases of malaria present complications of the host circulatory system, which may cause clogging and rupture of blood vessels, leading to death or important sequelae. Because of the previously suggested role of thrombin and platelet aggregation in Plasmodium falciparum biology, we hypothesized that one of the GPCR-like proteins identified in the genome of the parasite, P. falciparum serpentine receptor 12 (PfSR12), could be a thrombin-activated GPCR. To test this hypothesis we used a series of Bioluminescence and Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)-based biosensors to investigate the signaling activity of PfSR12. Using an Obelin based biosensor, thrombin promoted a PfSR12-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ rise in HEK293 cells. This Ca2+ mobilization was accompanied by DAG formation and PKC activation as detected using DAG and PKC BRET-based biosensors indicating a Gq/PLC/IP3 signaling pathway. The role of Gq was confirm using Gq/11 knockout HEK293 cells as well as the Gq-selective inhibitor, YM254890. Further investigation revealed that PfSR12 is not itself a thrombin receptor but rather promotes the increase of cell surface expression of an endogenous thrombin receptor. This chaperone-like effect was not selective for thrombin receptors as PfSR12 expression also promoted an increased muscarinic type 3 receptor (M3R)-promoted DAG and PKC responses. This increase response was accompanied by an increase in surface expression of M3R. Our data indicate that PfSR12 acts as a chaperone and increases the expression of several GPCRs resulting in increased responsiveness to various hormones of mammalian cells that could contribute to the deleterious effects of Plasmodium falciparum infection.","NA"

Here we produce a de novo assembly of the New World malaria mosquito, Anopheles albimanus by integrating Oxford Nanopore sequencing, Illumina, Hi-C and optical mapping. This 172.6 Mbps female assembly, which we call AalbS3, is obtained by scaffolding polished large contigs (contig N50=13.7 Mbps) into three chromosomes. All chromosome arms end with telomeric repeats, which is the first in mosquito assemblies and represents a significant step towards the completion of a genome assembly. These telomeres consist of tandem repeats of a novel 30-32 bp telomeric repeat unit (TRU) and are confirmed by analysing the termini of long reads and through both chromosomal in situ hybridization and a Bal31 sensitivity assay. The AalbS3 assembly included previously uncharacterized centromeric and rDNA clusters and more than doubled the content of transposable elements and other repetitive sequences. This telomere-to-telomere assembly, although still containing gaps, represents a significant step towards resolving biologically important but previously hidden genomic components. The comparison of different scaffolding methods will also inform future efforts to obtain reference-quality genomes for other mosquito species.

We describe novel telomeric repeats that are confirmed by analysis of long reads and by telomere hybridization assays.

However, the efficacy of GC therapy and whether the GC therapy should be based on the status of RAI are highly controversial. Critical barriers include technical limitations in properly identifying RAI in septic patients and a lack of RAI animal model.

ObjectivesWe established a new RAI animal model to test our hypothesis that precision medicine approach should be used for GC sepsis therapy - only applying GC to a subgroup of septic mice with RAI.

MethodsWe generated SF1CreSR-BIfl/fl conditional knockout mice. The mice exhibited specific depletion of SR-BI expression in adrenal gland, resulting in a lack of production of inducible GC in response to ACTH stimulation or sepsis, but the mice had normal basal GC levels. Mice were treated with cecal ligation and puncture to develop sepsis. Mice were also supplemented with or without GC to study the effect of GC in sepsis therapy. Plasma and organs were collected for biochemical assays. BODIPY  FL-conjugated Escherichia coli was used for phagocytosis assay. Macrophages were used to study effects of GC on inflammatory responses.

Measurements and Main ResultsUsing SF1CreSR-BIfl/fl mice as a RAI model, we found that mice with RAI were susceptible to CLP-induced sepsis compared to controls (6.7% survival in SF1CreSR-BIfl/fl mice versus 86.4% in SR-BIfl/fl mice; p=0.0001). Supplementation of hydrocortisone significantly improved survival in CLP-treated SF1CreSR-BIfl/fl mice. Surprisingly, wild type mice receiving GC treatment exhibited significantly less survival compared to wild type mice without GC treatment. We further found that, in contrast to wild type mice which displayed a well-controlled systemic inflammatory response, the mice with RAI featured a persisted systemic response as shown by high levels of plasma inflammatory cytokines/chemokines 20 hours post CLP, and supplementation of GC kept the inflammatory response under control. In vitro analysis revealed that stress level of GC is required to suppress inflammatory response through modulating MAPK signaling in macrophages.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate that RAI is a risk factor and an endotype for sepsis, and GC treatment benefits mice with RAI but harms mice without RAI. We further demonstrate that inducible GC functions to keep the systemic inflammatory response under control through modulating MAPK signaling, but mice with RAI lose such protection and supplementation of GC regains the protection. Our study provides a proof of concept to support the use of a precision medicine approach for sepsis therapy - selectively applying GC therapy for a subgroup of patients with RAI.","NA"

Technology-aided assessments should provide a sensitive and objective characterization of upper limb impairments, but often provide arm weight support and neglect the importance of the hand, thereby questioning their functional relevance. The Virtual Peg Insertion Test (VPIT) addresses these limitations by quantifying arm movements and grip forces during a goal-directed manipulation task without arm weight support. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential and robustness of the VPIT metrics to inform on sensorimotor impairments in arm and hand, and especially identify the functional relevance of the detected impairments.

MethodsArm and hand sensorimotor impairments were systematically characterized in 30 chronic stroke patients using conventional clinical scales and the VPIT. For the latter, ten previously established kinematic and kinetic core metrics were extracted and compared to conventional clinical scales of impairment and activity limitations. Additionally, the robustness of the VPIT metrics was investigated by analyzing their clinimetric properties (test-retest reliability, measurement error, and learning effects).

ResultsTwenty-three of the participants, the ones with mild to moderate sensorimotor impairments and without strong cognitive deficits, were able to successfully complete the VPIT protocol (duration 16.6 min). The VPIT metrics detected impairments in arm and hand in 90.0% of the participants, and were sensitive to increased muscle tone and pathological joint coupling. Most importantly, moderate to high significant correlations between conventional scales of activity limitations and the VPIT metrics were found, thereby indicating their functional relevance when grasping and transporting lightweight objects as well as dexterous finger manipulations. Lastly, the robustness of three out of the ten VPIT core metrics in post-stroke individuals was confirmed.

ConclusionsThis work provides evidence that technology-aided assessments requiring goal-directed manipulations without arm weight support can provide an objective, robust, and clinically feasible way to assess functionally relevant sensorimotor impairments in arm and hand in chronic post-stroke individuals with mild to moderate deficits. This allows better identifying impairments with high functional relevance and can contribute to optimizing the functional benefits of neurorehabilitation interventions.

We compile a literature overview of model-based approaches used to simulate or optimize the response to single RT sessions or to longterm RT plans in terms of strength, power, muscle mass, or local muscular endurance by varying the loading scheme. To the best of our knowledge, contributions employing a predictive model to algorithmically optimize loading schemes for different training goals are nonexistent in the literature. Thus, we propose to set up optimal control problems as follows. For the underlying dynamics, we use a phenomenological model of the time course of maximum voluntary isometric contraction force. Then, we provide mathematical formulations of key performance indicators for loading schemes identified in sport science and use those as objective functionals or constraints. We then solve those optimal control problems using previously obtained parameter estimates for the elbow flexors. We discuss our choice of training goals, analyze the structure of the computed solutions, and give evidence of their real-life feasibility. The proposed optimization methodology is independent from the underlying model and can be transferred to more elaborate physiological models once suitable ones become available.","NA"

In cows, particularly, milk production is observed to decline as a response to food shortage and climatic stress, leading to atypical lactation curves that are barely described by current lactation models. Here, we relied on five million monthly milk records from over 200,000 Braunvieh and Original Braunvieh cows to devise a new model accounting for transhumance, and test the influence of environmental, physiological, and morphological factors on cattle productivity. Counter to expectations, environmental conditions in the mountain showed a globally limited impact on milk production during transhumance, with cows in favourable conditions producing only 10% less compared to cows living in adverse conditions, and with precipitation in spring and altitude revealing to be the most production-affecting variables. Conversely, physiological factors as lactation number and pregnancy stage presented an important impact over the whole lactation cycle with 20% difference in milk production, and may therefore alter the way animals respond to transhumance. Finally, the considered morphological factors (cow height and foot angle) presented a smaller impact during the whole lactation cycle (10% difference in milk production). The present findings can help farmers to establish sustainable strategies for alleviating the negative effects of transhumance on productivity and preserving this important livestock practice.","NA"

However, except for allosteric activators of SIRT1-catalyzed reactions that are limited to particular substrates, a general framework for the design of sirtuin-activating compounds has been lacking. Recently, we introduced a general mode of sirtuin activation that is distinct from the known modes of enzyme activation, establishing biophysical properties of small molecule modulators that can, in principle, result in enzyme activation for various sirtuins and substrates. Here, we characterize small molecules reported in the literature to activate the SIRT3 enzyme, using a variety of computational, biochemical and biophysical techniques including protein-ligand docking, molecular dynamics simulation, numerical reaction dynamics simulation, kinetic assays and thermodynamic assays with multiple substrates and protocols. In particular, we identify the mechanism of action of the compound honokiol on the human SIRT3 enzyme, modeling its effect on active site conformational degrees of freedom and demonstrating how it nonallosterically activates the human SIRT3 enzyme under physiologically relevant conditions.

Using RNA sequencing, we determined the effect of external pH alkalinisation or sodium stress on gene expression. Data show that each condition triggers transcriptional responses with a low degree of overlap. By sequencing the transcriptomes of the null mutant, the role of SltA in the abovementioned homeostasis mechanisms was also studied. Results show that the transcriptional role of SltA is wider than initially expected and implies, for example, the positive control of the PacC-dependent ambient pH regulatory pathway.

Crystallographic analysis reveals that mAb 4G2 binds to a multi-domain site on Gc in the pre-fusion state, and that Fab binding is incompatible with the conformational changes of the Gc that are required for host cell entry. Cryo-electron microscopy of PUUV-like particles treated with Fab 4G2 demonstrates that the antibody binds to monomeric Gc at breaks in the Gn-Gc lattice, highlighting the immunological accessibility of Gc monomers on the mature hantavirus surface and the plastic nature of the higher-order lattice assembly.

This enabled us to discern neural states coding for immediately and prospectively task-relevant items, and to examine how these states contribute to WM-based decisions. We identified two qualitatively different neural states: a functionally latent state encoded both items, was unrelated to performance on the current trial, but predictive of performance accuracy over longer time scales.

Recently, C9ORF72, together with SMCR8 and WDR41, has been shown to regulate autophagy and function as Rab GEF. However, the precise function of C9ORF72 remains unclear. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the human C9ORF72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex at a resolution of 3.2 [A]. The structure reveals the dimeric assembly of a heterotrimer of C9ORF72-SMCR8-WDR41. Notably, the C-terminal tail of C9ORF72 and the DENN domain of SMCR8 play critical roles in the dimerization of the two protomers of the C9ORF72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex. In the protomer, C9ORF72 and WDR41 are joined by SMCR8 without direct interaction. WDR41 binds to the DENN domain of SMCR8 by the C-terminal helix. Interestingly, the prominent structural feature of C9ORF72-SMCR8 resembles that of the FLNC-FNIP2 complex, the GTPase activating protein (GAP) of RagC/D. Structural comparison and sequence alignment revealed that Arg147 of SMCR8 is conserved and corresponds to the arginine finger of FLCN, and biochemical analysis indicated that the Arg147 of SMCR8 is critical to the stimulatory effect of the C9ORF72-SMCR8 complex on Rab8a and Rab11a. Our study not only illustrates the basis of C9ORF72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex assembly but also reveals the GAP activity of the C9ORF72-SMCR8 complex.

Significance StatementC9ORF72, together with SMCR8 and WDR41, has been shown to form a stable complex that participates in the regulation of membrane trafficking. We report the cryo-EM structure of the C9ORF72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex at atomic resolution. Notably, the stoichiometry of the three subunits in the C9ORF72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex is 2:2:2. Interestingly, the C-termini of C9ORF72 and the DENN domain of SMCR8 mediate the dimerization of the two C9ORF72-SMCR8-WDR41 protomers in the complex. Moreover, WDR41 binds to the DENN domain of SMCR8 by the C-terminal helix without direct contact with C9ORF72. Most importantly, the C9ORF72-SMCR8 complex works as a GAP for Rab8a and Rab11a in vitro, and the Arg147 of SMCR8 is the arginine finger.","NA"

A.","Luiz A Peternelli","Universidade Federal de Vicosa.","2020-04-18",1,"cc_no","new results","genomics","BackgroundThe identification of genomic regions involved in agronomic traits is the primary concern for sugarcane breeders. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) leverage the sequence variations to bridge phenotypes and genotypes. However, their effectiveness is limited in species with high ploidy and large genomes, such as sugarcane. As an alternative, a regional heritability mapping (RHM) method can be used to capture genetic signals that may be missed by GWAS by combining genetic variance from neighboring regions. We used RHM to screen the sugarcane genome aiming to identify regions with higher heritability associated with agronomic traits. We considered percentage of fiber in sugarcane bagasse (FB), apparent percentage of sugarcane sucrose (PC), tonnes of pol per hectare (TPH), and tonnes of stalks per hectare (TSH).

MethodsSequence-capture data of 508 sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) clones from a breeding population under selection were processed for variant calling analysis using the sugarcane genome cultivar R570 as a reference. A set of 375,195 single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected after quality control. RHM was conducted by splitting the sugarcane genome into windows of 2 Mb length.

ResultsWe selected the windows explaining > 20% of the total genomic heritability for TPH (64 windows - 5,654 genes) and TSH (72 windows - 6,050 genes), and > 15% for PC (16 windows - 1,517 genes) and FB (17 windows - 1,615 genes). The top five windows that explained the highest genomic heritability ranged from 20.8 to 24.6% for FB (629 genes), 18.0 to 22.0% for PC (452 genes), 53.8 to 66.0% for TPH (705 genes), and 59.5 to 67.4% for TSH (413 genes). The functional annotation of genes included in those top five windows revealed a set of genes that encode enzymes that integrate carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways.

ConclusionsThe selection of windows that explained the large proportions of genomic heritability allowed us to identify genomic regions containing a set of genes that are related to the agronomic traits in sugarcane. These windows spanned a region of 58.38Mb, which corresponds to 14.28% of the reference assembly in the sugarcane genome. We contend that RHM can be used as an alternative method for sugarcane breeders to reduce the complexity of the sugarcane genome.","NA"

Here, we show in a lethal paramyxovirus model that Pam2-ODN-enhanced survival is associated with robust virus inactivation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which occurs prior to internalization by lung epithelial cells. However, we also found that mortality in sham-treated mice temporally corresponded with CD8+ T cell-enriched lung inflammation that peaks on days 11-12 after viral challenge, when the viral burden has waned to a scarcely detectable level. Pam2-ODN treatment blocked this injurious inflammation by reducing the viral burden, and alternatively, depleting CD8+ T cells 8 days after viral challenge also decreased mortality. These findings reveal opportunities for targeted immunomodulation to protect susceptible individuals against the morbidity and mortality of respiratory viral infections.","NA"

These shells are primarily composed of the polysaccharide chitin. V. cholerae-chitin interactions are critical for the growth, evolution, and waterborne transmission of cholera. This is due, in part, to chitin inducing changes in gene expression in this pathogen. Here, we sought to identify factors that influence chitin-induced expression of one locus, the chitobiose utilization operon (chb), which is required for the uptake and catabolism of the chitin disaccharide. Through a series of genetic screens, we identified that the master regulator of quorum sensing, HapR, is likely a direct repressor of the chb operon. We also found that the levels of HapR in V. cholerae are regulated by the ClpAP protease. Furthermore, we show that the canonical quorum sensing cascade in V. cholerae regulates chb expression in a HapR-dependent manner. Through this analysis we found that signaling via the species-specific autoinducer CAI-1, but not the inter-species autoinducer AI-2, influences chb expression. This phenomenon of species-specific regulation may enhance the fitness of this pathogen in its environmental niche.

ImportanceIn nature, bacteria live in multicellular and multispecies communities. Microbial species can sense the density and composition of their community through chemical cues using a process called quorum sensing (QS). The marine pathogen Vibrio cholerae forms communities on the chitinous shells of crustaceans in its aquatic reservoir, which is critical for the survival, evolution, and waterborne transmission of this pathogen. Here, we show that V. cholerae uses QS to regulate the expression of one locus required for V. cholerae-chitin interactions.","NA"

We also documented the effect of VLPs on bacterial hosts: we explain different bacterial  ultrastructural types detected in bryozoan tissues as stages in the gradual destruction of prokaryotic cells caused by viral multiplication during the lytic cycle. We speculate that viruses destroying bacteria regulate symbiont numbers in the bryozoan hosts, a phenomenon known in some insects. We develop two hypotheses explaining exo- and endogenous circulation of the viruses during the life-cycle of B. neritina. Finally, we compare unusual  sea-urchin-like structures found in the collapsed bacteria in P. sinuosa with so-called metamorphosis associated complexes (MACs) known to trigger larval metamorphosis in a polychaete worm.

ImportanceComplex symbiotic systems, including metazoan hosts, their bacterial symbionts and bacteriophages are widely studied using vertebrate models whereas much less is known about invertebrates. Our ultrastructural research revealed replication of the viruses and/or activation of virus related elements in the bacterial symbionts inhabiting tissues of the marine colonial invertebrates (phylum Bryozoa). The virus activity in the bacterial cells that are believed to be transmitted exclusively vertically is of a special importance. In addition, in the bacterial symbionts of one of the bryozoan hosts we observed the massive replication of the structures seemingly related to the Metamorphosis associated complexes (MAC). To our knowledge, MACs were never reported in the animal prokaryotic symbionts.

However, little is known about the evolution of sensorimotor integration. Mormyrid fishes generate stereotyped electric pulses (electric organ discharge [EOD]) for communication and active sensing. The EOD has diversified extensively, especially in duration, which varies across species from 0.1 to over 10 ms. In the electrosensory hindbrain, a corollary discharge that signals the timing of EOD production provides brief, precisely timed inhibition that effectively blocks responses to self-generated EODs. However, corollary discharge inhibition has only been studied in a few species, all with short duration EODs. Here, we asked how corollary discharge inhibition has coevolved with the diversification of EOD duration. We addressed this question by comparing 7 mormyrid species having varied EOD duration. For each individual fish, we measured EOD duration and then measured corollary discharge inhibition by recording evoked potentials from midbrain electrosensory nuclei. We found that delays in the onset of corollary discharge inhibition were strongly correlated with EOD duration as well as delay to the first peak of the EOD. In addition, we showed that electrosensory receptors respond to self-generated EODs with spikes occurring in a narrow time window immediately following the first peak of the EOD. Direct comparison of time courses between the EOD and corollary discharge inhibition revealed that the inhibition overlaps the first peak of the EOD. Our results suggest that internal delays have shifted the timing of corollary discharge inhibition to optimally block responses to self-generated signals.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCorollary discharges are internal copies of motor commands that are essential for brain function. For example, corollary discharge allows an animal to distinguish self-generated from external stimuli. Despite widespread diversity in behavior and its motor control, we know little about the evolution of corollary discharges. Mormyrid fishes generate stereotyped electric pulses used for communication and active sensing. In the electrosensory pathway that processes communication signals, a corollary discharge inhibits sensory responses to self-generated signals. We found that fish with long duration pulses have delayed corollary discharge inhibition, and that this time-shifted corollary discharge optimally blocks electrosensory responses to the fishs own signal. Our study provides the first evidence for evolutionary change in sensorimotor integration related to diversification of communication signals.","NA"

Recent single cell studies revealed how non-parenchymal cells, such as macrophages, hepatic stellate cells, and endothelial cells, heterogeneously respond to NAFLD. However, it remains to be characterized how hepatocytes, the major constituents of the liver, respond to nutritional overload in NAFLD. Here, using droplet-based single cell RNA-sequencing (Drop-seq), we characterized how the transcriptomic landscape of individual hepatocytes is altered in response to high-fat diet (HFD) and NAFLD. We showed that entire hepatocytes population undergoes substantial transcriptome changes upon HFD, although the patterns of alteration were highly heterogeneous with zonation-dependent and -independent effects. Periportal (zone 1) hepatocytes downregulated many zone 1-specific marker genes, while a small number of genes mediating gluconeogenesis were upregulated. Pericentral (zone 3) hepatocytes also downregulated many zone 3-specific genes; however, they upregulated several genes that promote HFD-induced fat droplet formation, consistent with findings that zone 3 hepatocytes accumulate more lipid droplets. Zone 3 hepatocytes also upregulated ketogenic pathways as an adaptive mechanism to HFD. Interestingly, many of the top HFD-induced genes, which encode proteins regulating lipid metabolism, were strongly co-expressed with each other in a subset of hepatocytes, producing a variegated pattern of spatial co-localization that is independent of metabolic zonation. In conclusion, our current dataset provides a useful resource for understanding hepatocellular alteration during NAFLD at single cell level.","NA"

Many studies have focused on their characteristic opercular flaring, while the less aggressive and less energetically costly lateral display have been comparatively understudied. Many factors have been shown to influence aggression in Bettas, notably body length and the personality trait of boldness, however, the role that colour plays in determining an individuals aggressiveness is much less clear. The role of colour has only been briefly studied, and based on human interpretations of colour, i.e. limited to what the receivers eyes and sensory systems actually can process and discriminate, with results suggesting blue males are more aggressive than red males. Using male-male interactions, measuring opercular flaring and lateral display we found that colour and personality do play a role in determining the degree of aggressiveness in Betta splendens. Blue-finned males were more aggressive, performing longer lateral displays more frequently. Blue fins are a phenotype observed in wild type males and is likely selected for to allow visual cues to travel through the murky water they inhabit. Body mass was positively correlated with lateral display frequency, and opercular flare frequency and duration. Finally, neophobic individuals - individuals that were less willing to approach a novel object - were more aggressive, performing significantly more lateral displays. This indicates that personality may impact fighting strategy, with males either choosing to end conflicts quickly with more aggressive displays or to outlast their opponent with less energetically costly displays.","NA"

The distribution of these mutations in HNSCC suggests that they are likely to be inactivating. Inhibition of CASP8 has been reported to sensitize cancer cells to necroptosis, a unique cell death mechanism. Here, we evaluated how CASP8 regulates necroptosis in HSNCC using cell line models and syngeneic mouse xenografts. In vitro, knockdown of CASP8 rendered HNSCCs susceptible to necroptosis induced by a second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) mimetic, Birinapant, when combined with pan-caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-FMK or Emricasan. Strikingly, inhibition of CASP8 function via knockdown or Emricasan treatment was associated with enhanced radiation killing by Birinapant through induction of necroptosis. In a syngeneic mouse model of oral cancer, Birinapant, particularly when combined with radiation delayed tumor growth and enhanced survival under CASP8 loss. Exploration of molecular underpinnings of necroptosis sensitivity confirmed that the level of functional receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase-3 (RIP3), a key enzyme in the necroptosis pathway was crucial in determining susceptibility to this mode of death. Although an in vitro screen revealed that many HNSCC cell lines were resistant to necroptosis due to low levels of RIP3, patient tumors maintain RIP3 expression and should therefore remain sensitive. Collectively, these results suggest that targeting the necroptosis pathway with SMAC mimetics, especially in combination with radiation, may be a relevant therapeutic approach in HNSCC with compromised CASP8 status, provided that RIP3 function is maintained.

SignificanceCASP8 status regulates necroptotic death in HNSCC and this pathway can be exploited therapeutically.","NA"

Studies have shown that miR-874 (miR-874) inhibitors can reduce H2O2-induced cardiomyocyte necrosis and may have a therapeutic effect on heart failure in terms of cardiomyocyte necrosis. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment is to study the other effects of miR-874 and miR-146a on the key pathways in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. In this study, the roles of miR-874 antagomiR and miR-146a in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were analyzed. we investigated the level of miR-874 expression in H9C2 cardiomyocytes after miR-874 antagomiR transfection and found that the miR-874 expression in the H9C2 cells transfected with miR-874 antagomiR group was significantly lower than that in the control group. The results showed that miR-874 was successfully knocked down by the transfection of miR-874 antagomiR. Our results demonstrated that miR-874 inhibition has no effect on the activity of Caspase-3/7 in cardiomyocytes. miR-874 antagomiR has no effect on the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts, whereas it can inhibit the activity of caspase-8 in cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, the potential effect of miR-874 antagomiR on cardiac remodeling associated genes were examined. miR-874 antagomiR had no effect on SERCA2a mRNA level in H9C2 cells. In addition, miR-874 antagomiR were able to down-regulate the mRNA level of MMP9 and had no effect on MMP2 mRNA levels in H9C2 cells. Finally, The concentration of Ca2+ was measured using Fluo-4 NW Calcium Assay Kits following transfection of miRNAs or negative control in primary cardiomyocytes. miR-874 antagomiR was found to have no effect on Ca2+ concentration in cardiomyocytes. the concentration of Ca2+ in the cardiomyocytes transfected with miR-146a mimics was significantly lower than the mimic negative control group. In summary, miR-874 antagomiR and miR-146a may have a therapeutic effect on heart failure, but may also have side effects on heart failure treatment. Therefore, miR-874 antagomiR should be further studied to provide a basis for the development of drugs for heart failure.","NA"

Two important, but anthropogenically altered, sources of selection on dispersal are climate and habitat continuity. Despite the likelihood these global drivers of selection act simultaneously on plant populations, their combined effects on dispersal are rarely examined. To understand the interactive effect of climate and habitat continuity on dispersal potential, we study Geum triflorum - a perennial grassland species that spans a wide range of environments, including both continuous prairie and isolated alvar habitats. We explore how the local climate of the growing season and habitat continuity (continuous vs isolated) interact to alter dispersal potential. We find a consistent interactive effect of local climate and habitat continuity on dispersal potential. Across continuous prairie populations, an increased number of growing degree days favors traits that increase dispersal potential. However, for isolated alvar populations, dispersal potential tends to decrease as the number of growing degree days increase. Our findings suggest that under continued warming, populations in continuous habitats will benefit from increased gene flow, while isolated populations will become increasingly segregated, with reduced potential to track shifting fitness optima.","NA"

The multilocus data were initially used to characterize interspecific hybrids. Introgression (F2 hybrids) was only confirmed in hatchlings of F1 hybrid females (hawksbill x loggerhead), indicating that introgression was either previously overestimated and F2 hybrids may not survive to adulthood, or the first-generation hybrid females nesting in Brazil were born as recent as few decades ago. Phylogenetic analyses using nuclear markers recovered the mtDNA-based Indo-Pacific and Atlantic lineages for hawksbill turtles, demonstrating a deep genetic divergence dating from the early Pliocene. In addition, loggerhead turtles that share a common feeding area and belong to distinct Indo-Pacific and Atlantic mtDNA clades present no clear genetic differentiation at the nuclear level.

We identified genome-wide repair hotspots exhibiting high-level nucleotide excision repair immediately after UV irradiation. We show that such repair hotspots do not result from hypersensitivity to DNA damage, and are thus not damage hotspots. We find that the earliest repair occurs preferentially in promoters and enhancers from open-chromatin regions. The repair hotspots are also significantly enriched for frequently interacting regions and superenhancers, both of which are themselves hotspots for local chromatin interactions.

We show that elimination of this confounding can reduce both Type I and Type II errors, and demonstrate the effect of approach on real data.

ResultsWe apply this method to two publicly available datasets, and demonstrate its ability to reduce the potential confounding of differences in expression due the species-specific intraerythrocytic development cycle from strain-specific differences in drug response. We show that the application of cyclical regression covariates has minimal impact on the pool of transcripts identified as significantly different in a dataset generated from single timepoint clinical blood samples with low variance for developmental stage and a profound impact on another clinical data set with more variance among the samples for developmental stage.

The presence of segregating polymorphisms inside miRNA loci and their corresponding 3UTR binding sites might disrupt canonical conserved miRNA-mRNA pairing, thus modifying gene expression patterns.

ResultsWe aimed to investigate the variability of miRNA genes and their putative binding sites by analyzing whole-genome sequences from 120 pigs and wild boars from Europe and Asia. In total, 285 SNPs residing within miRNA loci were detected. From these, 221 were located in precursor regions, whereas 52 and 12 mapped to mature and seed regions, respectively. Moreover, a total of 109,724 polymorphisms were identified in predicted 7mer-m8 miRNA binding sites within porcine 3UTRs. A principal components analysis revealed a clear genetic divergence between Asian and European samples, which was particularly strong for 3UTR sequences. We also observed that miRNA genes show reduced polymorphism compared with other non-miRNA regions. To assess the potential consequences of miRNA polymorphisms, we sequenced the genomes of 5 Duroc pigs and, by doing so, we identified 15 miRNA SNPs that were genotyped in the offspring (N = 345) of the five boars. Association analyses between miRNA SNPs and hepatic and muscle microarray data allowed us to identify 4 polymorphisms displaying significant associations. Particularly interesting was the rs319154814 polymorphism (G/A), located in the apical loop of the ssc-miR-326 precursor sequence. This polymorphism is predicted to cause a subtle hairpin rearrangement that improves the accessibility to processing enzymatic factors.

ConclusionsPorcine miRNA genes show a reduced variability, particularly in the seed region which plays a critical role in miRNA binding. Although it is generally assumed that SNPs mapping to the seed region are the ones with the strongest consequences on mRNA expression, we show that a SNP mapping to the apical region of ssc-miR-326 is associated with the mRNA expression of several of its predicted targets. This result suggests that porcine miRNA variability mapping within and outside the seed region could have important regulatory effects on gene expression.","NA"

Among them, trial number and inter-trial interval (ITI) are key factors to induce long-term retention. However, it is still unclear how individual training trials contribute to mechanisms underlying memory formation and stabilization. Contextual conditioning in Neohelice granulata has traditionally elicited associative long-term memory (LTM) after 15 spaced (ITI = 3 min) trials. Here, we show that LTM in crabs can be induced after only two training trials by increasing the ITI to 45 min (2t-LTM) and maintaining the same training duration as in traditional protocols. This new LTM observed was preserved for at least 96 h, exhibited protein synthesis dependence during consolidation and reconsolidation as well as context-specificity. Moreover, we demonstrate that 2t-LTM depends on inter-trial and post-training ERK activation showing a faster phosphorylation after the second trial compared to the first one. In summary, we present a new training protocol in crabs with reduced number of trials that shows associative features similar to traditional spaced training. This novel protocol allows intra-training manipulation and the assessment of individual trial contribution to LTM formation.","NA"

To provide a baseline for state-related and task-related events, we quantified oscillation features in resting-state recordings. We used two invasively-recorded electrophysiology datasets: one from human, and one from non-human primate auditory system. After removing event related potentials, we used a wavelet transform based method to quantify oscillation features. We identified about 2 million oscillation events, classified within traditional frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, high gamma. Oscillation events of 1-44 cycles were present in at least one frequency band in 90% of the recordings, consistent across human and non-human primate. Individual oscillation events were characterized by non-constant frequency and amplitude. This result naturally contrasts with prior studies which assumed such constancy, but is consistent with evidence from event-associated oscillations. We measured oscillation event duration, frequency span, and waveform shape. Oscillations tended to exhibit multiple cycles per event, verifiable by comparing filtered to unfiltered waveforms. In addition to the clear intra-event rhythmicity, there was also evidence of inter-event rhythmicity within bands, demonstrated by finding that coefficient of variation of interval distributions and Fano Factor measures differed significantly from a Poisson distribution assumption. Overall, our study demonstrates that rhythmic oscillation events dominate auditory cortical dynamics.","NA"

The most well-known effect of unexpected events is the interruption of attentional engagement (distraction). We tested whether unexpected events interrupt attentional representations by activating a neural mechanism for inhibitory control. This mechanism is most well-characterized within the motor system. However, recent work showed that it is automatically activated by unexpected events and can explain some of their non-motor effects (e.g., on working memory representations). Here, human participants attended to lateralized flickering visual stimuli, producing steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) in the scalp-electroencephalogram. After unexpected sounds, the SSVEP was rapidly suppressed. Using a functional localizer (stop-signal) task and independent component analysis, we then identified a fronto-central EEG source whose activity indexes inhibitory motor control. Unexpected sounds in the SSVEP task also activated this source. Using single-trial analyses, we found that sub-components of this source differentially relate to sound-related SSVEP changes: while its N2 component predicted the subsequent suppression of the attended-stimulus SSVEP, the P3 component predicted the suppression of the SSVEP to the unattended stimulus. These results shed new light on the processes underlying fronto-central control signals and have implications for phenomena such as distraction and the attentional blink.","NA"

An integral part of programming is code comprehension: the ability to process individual program tokens, combine them into statements, which, in turn, combine to form a program. What cognitive and neural mechanisms support this ability to process computer code? Here, we used fMRI to investigate the role of two candidate brain systems in code comprehension: the multiple demand (MD) system, typically recruited for math, logic, problem solving, and executive function, and the language system, typically recruited for linguistic processing. Across two experiments, we examined brain responses to code written in two programing languages: Python, a text-based programming language (Experiment 1) and ScratchJr, a graphical programming language for children (Experiment 2). To isolate neural activity evoked by code comprehension per se rather than by processing program content, we contrasted responses to code problems with responses to content-matched sentence problems. We found that the MD system exhibited strong bilateral responses to code in both experiments. In contrast, the language system responded strongly to sentence problems, but only weakly or not at all to code problems. We conclude that code comprehension relies primarily on domain-general executive resources, demonstrating that the MD system supports the use of novel cognitive tools even when the input is structurally similar to natural language.","NA"

We corroborate the grouping of dromaeosaurids + troodontids (Deinonychosauria) as the sister taxon to birds (Paraves), as well as the recovery of Anchiornithidae as basalmost avialans. Using these phylogenetic results and available data for vaned feathered paravians, maximum and minimum estimates of wing loading and specific lift calculated using ancestral state reconstruction analysis are used as proxies for the potential for powered flight through this transition. We found a broad range of paravian ancestors with estimates approaching values that are indicative of powered flight potential. This suggests that prior to the evolution of flight there was a wider extent of experimentation with wing-assisted locomotion among paravians than previously appreciated. We recovered wing loading and specific lift estimates indicating the potential for powered flight among fossil birds as well as unenlagiine and microraptorine dromaeosaurids.

These models are often based on static networks and ignore the sequence of movement, possibly overestimating the epidemic sizes. In this research, we adapt and employ an agent-based model that simulates beef cattle production and transportation in southwest Kansas to analyze the between-premises transmission of a highly contagious disease, the foot-and-mouth disease. First, we assess the impact of truck contamination on the disease transmission with the truck agent following an independent clean-infected-clean cycle. Second, we add an information-sharing functionality such that producers/packers can trace back and forward their trade records to inform their trade partners during outbreaks. Scenario analysis results show that including indirect contact routes between premises via truck movements can significantly increase the amplitude of disease spread, compared with equivalent scenarios that only consider animal movement. Mitigation strategies informed by information sharing can dramatically improve the system resilience against epidemics, highlighting the benefit of promoting information sharing in the cattle industry. In addition, we identify salient characteristics that must be considered when designing an information-sharing strategy, including the number of days to trace back and forward in the trade records and the role of different cattle supply chain stakeholders.

Increased telomere shortening in leukocytes is associated with a range of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, the onset and progression of which may be mediated by behavioural traits such as anxiety and stress reactivity. However, the effects of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis stress response are shown to be tissue specific. As such, leukocyte telomere length may not give an accurate measure of the relationship between stress-reactivity and telomere length in disease relevant tissues. To test the hypothesis that stress-reactivity contributes to age-related telomere shortening in a tissue specific manner, we examined the correlation between telomere length in heart and brain tissue and stress-reactivity in a population of young (6-9 month) and ageing (18 month) zebrafish. Stress-reactivity was assessed by tank diving, a zebrafish version of the rodent open-field test, and through gene expression. Telomere length was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We show that ageing zebrafish have shorter telomeres in both heart and brain. Telomere length is inversely related to stress-reactivity in heart but not brain of ageing individuals. These data support the hypotheses that an anxious predisposition contributes to telomere shortening in heart tissue, and by extension age-related heart disease, and that stress-reactivity contributes to age-related telomere shortening in a tissue-specific manner.","NA"

The processes that effect systemic hydro-electrolytic homeostasis maintain hemolymph ionic composition via membrane transporters located in highly specialized gill ionocytes. We evaluated physiological and molecular hyper- and hypo-osmoregulatory mechanisms in two phylogenetically distant, freshwater crustaceans, the crab Dilocarcinus pagei and the shrimp Macrobrachium jelskii, when osmotically challenged for up to 10 days. When in distilled water, hemolymph osmolality and [Cl-] increased briefly in D. pagei, stabilizing at initial values, while [Na+] decreased continually. Gill V(H+)-ATPase, Na+/K+-ATPase and Na+/K+/2Cl- gene expressions were unchanged. In M. jelskii, hemolymph osmolality, [Cl-] and [Na+] decreased continually for 12 h, the shrimps no longer surviving. Gill transporter gene expressions increased 2- to 5-fold. After 10-days exposure to brackish water, D. pagei was isosmotic, iso-chloremic and iso-natriuremic. Gill V(H+)-ATPase expression decreased while Na+/K+-ATPase and Na+/K+/2Cl- expressions were unchanged. In M. jelskii, the hemolymph was hypo-regulated, particularly [Cl-]. Transporter expressions initially increased 3- to 12-fold, declining to control values. Gill V(H+)-ATPase expression underlies the ability of D. pagei to survive in fresh water while Na+/K+-ATPase and Na+/K+/2Cl- expressions enable M. jelskii to deal with osmotic challenge. These findings reveal divergent responses in two unrelated crustaceans habiting a similar osmotic niche. While D. pagei has maintained the capacity to tolerate elevated cellular isosmoticity despite its inability to secrete salt, M. jelskii displays clear hypo-osmoregulatory ability. Each species has developed distinct strategies at the transcription and systemic levels during adaptation to fresh water.

Methods based on random integrations of multiple genes have been successfully used for metabolic engineering in plants. However, efficiency of co-integration and co-expression of the genes could present a bottleneck. Recombinase-mediated integration into the engineered target sites is arguably a more efficient method of targeted integration that leads to the generation of stable transgenic lines at a high rate. This method has the potential to streamline multigene transformation for metabolic engineering and trait stacking in plants. Therefore, empirical testing of transgene(s) stability from the multigene site-specific integration locus is needed. Here, the recombinase technology based on Cre-lox recombination was evaluated for developing multigenic lines harboring constitutively-expressed and inducible genes. Targeted integration of a 5 genes cassette in the rice genome generated a precise full-length integration of the cassette at a high rate, and the resulting multigenic lines expressed each gene reliably as defined by their promoter activity. The stable constitutive or inducible expression was faithfully transmitted to the progeny, indicating inheritance-stability of the multigene locus. Co-localization of two distinctly inducible genes by heat or cold with the strongly constitutive genes did not appear to interfere with each others expression pattern. In summary, high rate of co-integration and co-expression of the multigene cassette installed by the recombinase technology in rice shows that this approach is appropriate for multigene transformation and introduction of co-segregating traits.

Significance StatementRecombinase-mediated site-specific integration approach was found to be highly efficacious in multigene transformation of rice showing proper regulation of each gene driven by constitutive or inducible promoter. This approach holds promise for streamlining gene stacking in crops and expressing complex multigenic traits.","NA"

Towards this goal, we employed the existing modular extracellular sensor architecture (MESA) and systematically characterized biosensors with previously unexamined protein domain choices. A key finding that might extend to other receptor systems is that choice of transmembrane domain (TMD) is highly consequential. To provide mechanistic insights, we adopted and employed a FRET-based assay to elucidate how TMDs affect receptor complex formation and connected these observations to functional performance. To build further insight into these phenomena, we developed a library of new MESA receptors that sense an expanded set of ligands. Based upon these explorations, we conclude that TMDs affect signaling primarily by modulating intracellular domain geometry, and we apply this understanding to rationally tune receptors. Finally, to guide the design of future receptors, we propose general principles for linking design choices to biophysical mechanisms and performance characteristics.","NA"

Existing spatial normalization methods have poor accuracy particularly when dealing with the highly convoluted human cerebral cortex and when brain morphology is severely altered (e.g. clinical and aging populations). To address this shortcoming, we propose to implement and evaluate a novel landmark-guided region-based spatial normalization technique that takes advantage of the existing surface-based human brain parcellation to automatically identify and match regional landmarks. To simplify the non-linear whole brain registration, the identified landmarks of each region and their counterparts are registered independently with large diffeomorphic (topology preserving) deformation via geodesic shooting. The regional diffeomorphic warping fields were combined by an inverse distance weighted interpolation technique to have a smooth global warping field for the whole brain. To ensure that the final warping field is diffeomorphic, we used simultaneously forward and reverse maps with certain symmetric constraints to yield bijectivity. We have evaluated our proposed method using both simulated and real (structural and functional) human brain images. Our evaluation shows that our method can enhance structural correspondence up to around 86%, a 67% improvement compared to the existing state-of-the-art method. Such improvement also increases the sensitivity and specificity of the functional imaging studies by about 17%, reducing the required number of subjects and subsequent costs.

This hinders the estimation of  real biological signals and, thus, decreases the power of statistical tests and biases the identification of differentially expressed sample classes. To remove such unintended variation, while retaining the biological signal of interest, the analysis workflows for mass spectrometry-based quantification typically comprises normalization steps prior to the statistical analysis of the data. Several normalization methods, such as quantile normalization, have originally been developed for microarray data. However, unlike microarray data, proteomics data may contain features, in the form of protein intensities, that are consistently highly abundant across experimental conditions and, hence, are encountered in the tails of the protein intensity distribution. If such proteins are present, statistical inferences of the intensity profiles of the normalized features are impeded through the increased number of false positive findings due to the biased estimation of the variance of the data. Thus, we developed a, freely available, novel approach:  tail-robust quantile normalization. It extends the traditional quantile normalization to preserve the biological signals of features in the tails of the distribution over experimental conditions and to account for sample-dependent missing values.","NA"

However, the large-amplitude dynamics of the positively charged disordered regions of H1 persist on the nucleosome and facilitate the interaction with the highly negatively charged and disordered histone chaperone prothymosin .

Here, we outline multi-omic strategies for transcriptome imputation from germline genetics for testing gene-trait associations by prioritizing distal-SNPs to the gene of interest. In one extension, we identify mediating biomarkers (CpG sites, microRNAs, and transcription factors) highly associated with gene expression and train predictive models for these mediators using their local SNPs. Imputed values for mediators are then incorporated into the final model as fixed effects with local SNPs to the gene included as regularized effects. In the second extension, we assess distal-eSNPs (SNPs in eQTLs) for their mediation effect through mediators local to these distal-eSNPs. Highly mediated distal-eSNPs are then included in the eventual transcriptomic prediction model. We show considerable gains in percent variance explained of gene expression and TWAS power to detect gene-trait associations using simulation analysis and real data applications with TCGA breast cancer data and in ROS/MAP brain tissue data. This integrative approach to transcriptome-wide imputation and association studies aids in understanding the complex interactions underlying genetic regulation within a tissue and identifying important risk genes for various traits and disorders.","NA"

Impulsivity is known to affect inhibitory, emotional and cognitive function. On the other hand, smell and odor processing are known to be affected by neurological disorders, as they are modulators of addictive and impulsive behaviors specifically. We hypothesize that, after LDX ingestion, inhibitory pathways of the brain would change, and complementary behavioral regulation mechanisms would appear to regulate decision-making and impulsivity.

Methods20 children were studied in an aleatory crossover study. Imaging of BOLD-fMRI activity, elicited by olfactory stimulation in impulsive children, was performed after either LDX or placebo ingestion.

ResultsFindings showed that all subjects that underwent odor stimulation presented activations of similar intensities in the olfactory centers of the brain. This contrasted with inhibitory regions of the brain such as the cingulate cortex and frontal lobe regions, which demonstrated changed activity patterns and intensities. While some differences between the placebo and medicated states were found in motor areas, precuneus, cuneus, calcarine, supramarginal, cerebellum and posterior cingulate cortex, the main changes were found in frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. When comparing olfactory cues separately, pleasant food smells like chocolate seemed not to present large differences between the medicated and placebo scenarios, when compared to non-food-related smells.

ConclusionsWe demonstrated that LDX, first, altered the inhibitory pathways of the brain, second, increased activity in large amounts of brain regions which were not activated by smell in drug-naive patients, third, facilitated a complementary behavioral regulation mechanism, run by the cerebellum, which regulated decision-making and impulsivity in motor and frontal structures.","NA"

However, how different firing modes affect learning and valence coding of sensory information are unknown. Here bilateral optogenetic activation of rat LC neurons using 10-Hz phasic trains of either 300 msec or 10 sec accelerates acquisition of a food-rewarded similar odor discrimination, but not a dissimilar odor discrimination, consistent with LC-supported enhanced pattern separation and plasticity. Similar odor discrimination learning is impaired by noradrenergic blockade in the piriform cortex (PC). However, here 10-Hz LC phasic light-mediated learning facilitation is prevented by a dopaminergic antagonist in the PC, or by ventral tegmental area (VTA) silencing with lidocaine, suggesting an LC-VTA-PC dopamine circuitry mediates 10-Hz phasic learning facilitation. Tonic stimulation at 10 Hz did not alter odor discrimination acquisition, and was less effective in activating VTA DA neurons. For valence encoding, tonic stimulation at 25 Hz induced freezing, anxiety and conditioned odor aversion, while 10-Hz phasic stimulation produced an odor preference consistent with positive valence. Noradrenergic blockade in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) prevented conditioned odor preference and aversion induced by 10-Hz phasic and 25-Hz tonic light respectively. CTB retro-labeling showed relatively larger engagement of nucleus accumbens projecting neurons over central amygdala projecting neurons in the BLA with 10-Hz LC phasic activation, compared to 25-Hz tonic.

The aim of the present study was to test whether the pharmacological regulation of TMEM16A channel function, both potentiation and inhibition, could affect any of these proposed biological roles.

In vitro, a recently described potent and selective TMEM16A potentiator (ETX001) failed to stimulate mucin release from primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells over a 24h exposure period using both biochemical and imaging endpoints. In addition, treatment of HBE cells with ETX001 or a potent and selective TMEM16A inhibitor (Ani9) for 4 days did not influence mucin release or goblet cell formation. In vivo, a TMEM16A potentiator was without effect on goblet cell emptying in an IL-13 driven goblet cell metaplasia model.

Using freshly isolated human bronchi and pulmonary arteries, neither ETX001 or Ani9 had any effect on the contractile or relaxant responses of the tissues. In vivo, ETX001 also failed to influence either lung or cardiovascular function when delivered directly into the airways of telemetered rats.

Glucose uptake is commonly quantified by using flow cytometry for cell cultures and positron emission tomography for organs in vivo. However, methods to detect spatiotemporally resolved glucose uptake in intact tissues are far more limited, particularly those that can quantify changes in uptake over time in specific tissue regions and cell types. Using lymph node metabolism as a case study, we developed a novel assay of dynamic and spatially resolved glucose uptake in living tissue by combining ex vivo tissue slice culture with a fluorescent glucose analogue. Live slices of murine lymph node were treated with the glucose analogue 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-dia-xol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG). Incubation and washing parameters were optimized to differentiate glucose uptake in activated versus naive lymphocytes. Confocal microscopy of treated tissues confirmed that the 2-NBDG signal was intracellular. The assay was readily multiplexed with live immunofluorescence labelling to generate maps of 2-NBDG uptake across tissue regions, revealing highest uptake in T cell-dense regions. Uptake was predominantly localized to lymphocytes rather than stromal cells. Because 2-NBDG washed out of the tissue over time, the assay was repeatable in the same slices before and after T cell activation to reveal which tissue regions were most responsive to stimulation. We anticipate that this assay will serve as a broadly applicable, user-friendly platform to quantify dynamic metabolic activities in complex tissue microenvironments.","NA"

Genomic studies have revealed five different intrinsic subtypes - Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, Claudin-low, and Basal-like. Patients diagnosed with Basal-like or Claudin-low breast cancer (BL-CL) suffer from poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify a new therapeutic lead that can benefit patients with BL-CL breast cancer.

MethodsWe used a step-wise screening approach to screen 2778 HP20 fractions from our Marine Invertebrate Compound Library (MICL) to identify compounds that specifically target BL-CL breast cancer. We also performed biochemical investigations to study the effect of the compound in the signaling pathway. Finally, we generated a drug response gene-expression signature and projected it against a human tumor panel of 12 different cancer types to identify other cancer types sensitive to the compound.

ResultsWe identified a previously unreported trisulfated sterol, topsentinol L trisulfate (TLT) that exhibits increased efficacy against BL-CL relative to Luminal/HER2+ breast cancer. Biochemical investigation of the effects of TLT on BL-CL revealed its ability to inhibit activation of AMPK and CHK1 and promote activation of p38. The importance of targeting AMPK and CHK1 in BL-CL was validated by treating a panel of breast cancer cell lines with known small molecule inhibitors of AMPK (Dorsomorphin) and CHK1 (Ly2603618) and recording the increased effectiveness against BL-CL compared to Luminal/HER2+ breast cancer. The TLT sensitivity gene-expression signature identified breast and bladder cancer as the most sensitive to TLT while glioblastoma multiforme as least sensitive.

ConclusionsOur study identified TLT, a previously uncharacterized trisulfated sterol, as a potential therapeutic selective against BL-CL. Our results also showed that inhibition of AMPK and/or CHK1 might be an effective therapy in BL-CL.","NA"

Our data reveal an intensely immune-suppressive immune TME in p-NS tumors characterized by an increase in Treg cells and a decrease in cytotoxic T cells relative to normal lung. The TME of the solid tumor group, more advanced lesions than the p-NS yet still early in disease development, were increasingly more immune-suppressive. Provocatively, there was a further increase in both Treg cells and cytotoxic T cells, establishing a nascent albeit ineffective anti-tumor immune response in transition from preinvasive p-NS to invasive solid tumors. Regulatory T cells play a dominant role throughout progression, while additional immune evasive mechanisms are employed at different stages of disease progression, including T cell exclusion from cancer cell nests early and activation of immune checkpoints later.

Here, we describe the development of nuclear elastography, which combines microscopic imaging and computational modeling to quantify the relative elasticity of the heterochromatin and euchromatin domains. Using contracting murine embryonic cardiomyocytes, nuclear elastography reveals that the heterochromatin is almost four times stiffer than the euchromatin at peak deformation. The relative elasticity between the two domains changes rapidly during the active deformation of the cardiomyocyte in the normal physiological condition but progresses more slowly in cells cultured in a mechanically stiff environment, although the relative stiffness at peak deformation does not change. Further, we found that the disruption of the LINC complex in cardiomyocytes compromises the intranuclear elasticity distribution resulting in elastically similar heterochromatin and euchromatin. These results provide insight into the elastography dynamics of heterochromatin and euchromatin domains, and provide a non-invasive framework to further investigate the mechanobiological function of subcellular and subnuclear domains limited only by the spatiotemporal resolution of the image acquisition method.","NA"

For an unknown reason, large parts of the BGCs are transcriptionally silent under laboratory conditions, which has hampered the discovery of novel fungal compounds. The transcriptional regulation of fungal secondary metabolism is not fully understood from an evolutionary viewpoint. To address this issue, we conducted comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses using five closely related species of the Aspergillus section Fumigati: Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus lentulus, Aspergillus udagawae, Aspergillus pseudoviridinutans, and Neosartorya fischeri. From their genomes, 298 secondary metabolite (SM) core genes were identified, with 27.4% to 41.5% being unique to a species. Compared with the species-specific genes, a set of section-conserved SM core genes was expressed at a higher rate and greater magnitude, suggesting that their expression tendency is correlated with the BGC distribution pattern. However, the section-conserved BGCs showed diverse expression patterns across the Fumigati species. Thus, not all common BGCs across species appear to be regulated in an identical manner. A consensus motif was sought in the promoter region of each gene in the 15 section-conserved BGCs among the Fumigati species. A conserved motif was detected in only two BGCs including the gli cluster. The comparative transcriptomic and in silico analyses provided insights into how the fungal SM gene cluster diversified at a transcriptional level, in addition to genomic rearrangements and cluster gains and losses. This information increases our understanding of the evolutionary processes associated with fungal secondary metabolism.

Author summaryFilamentous fungi provide a wide variety of bioactive compounds that contribute to public health. The ability of filamentous fungi to produce bioactive compounds has been underestimated, and fungal resources can be developed into new drugs. However, most biosynthetic genes encoding bioactive compounds are not expressed under laboratory conditions, which hampers the use of fungi in drug discovery. The mechanisms underlying silent metabolite production are poorly understood. Here, we attempted to show the diversity in fungal transcriptional regulation from an evolutionary viewpoint. To meet this goal, the secondary metabolisms, at genomic and transcriptomic levels, of the most phylogenetically closely related species in Aspergillus section Fumigati were compared. The conserved biosynthetic gene clusters across five Aspergillus species were identified. The expression levels of the well-conserved gene clusters tended to be more active than the species-specific, which were not well-conserved, gene clusters. Despite highly conserved genetic properties across the species, the expression patterns of the well-conserved gene clusters were diverse. These findings suggest an evolutionary diversification at the transcriptional level, in addition to genomic rearrangements and gains and losses, of the biosynthetic gene clusters. This study provides a foundation for understanding fungal secondary metabolism and the potential to produce diverse fungal-based chemicals.","NA"

It is not fully clear how these changes affect the processing of everyday spoken language. Prediction is thought to play an important role in language comprehension, where information about upcoming words is pre-activated across multiple representational levels. However, evidence from electrophysiology suggests differences in how older and younger adults use context-based predictions, particularly at the level of semantic representation. We investigate these differences during natural speech comprehension by presenting older and younger subjects with continuous, narrative speech while recording their electroencephalogram. We use linear regression to test how distinct computational measures of 1) semantic dissimilarity and 2) lexical surprisal are processed in the brains of both groups. Our results reveal dissociable neural correlates of these two measures that suggest differences in how younger and older adults successfully comprehend speech. Specifically, our results suggest that, while younger and older subjects both employ context-based lexical predictions, older subjects are significantly less likely to pre-activate the semantic features relating to upcoming words. Furthermore, across our group of older adults, we show that the weaker the neural signature of this semantic pre-activation mechanism, the lower a subjects semantic verbal fluency score. We interpret these findings as prediction playing a generally reduced role at a semantic level in the brains of older listeners during speech comprehension and that these changes may be part of an overall strategy to successfully comprehend speech with reduced cognitive resources.","NA"

Self-initiated voluntary actions, produced without any immediate external cue, may be preceded by a slow EEG Readiness Potential (RP) that progressively increases prior to action. The cognitive significance of this neural event is controversial. Some accounts link the RP to the fact that timing of voluntary actions is generated endogenously, without external constraints, and perhaps even randomly. Other accounts take the RP as reflecting the unique role of planning, therefore of temporal expectation, in voluntary actions. In many previous experiments, actions are both unconstrained by external cues, but also potentially involve preplanning and anticipation. To separate these factors, we developed a reinforcement learning paradigm where participants learned, through trial and error, the optimal time to act. If the RP reflects freedom from external constraint, its amplitude should be greater early in learning, when participants do not yet know the best time to act. Conversely, if the RP reflects planning, it should be greater later on, when participants have learned, and know in advance, the time of action. We found that RP amplitudes grew with learning, suggesting that this neural activity reflects planning and anticipation for the forthcoming action, rather than freedom from external constraint.","NA"

The model consists of a network of spiking leaky-integrate-and-fire model neurons placed in a modular architecture designed to resemble cortical microcolumns. Learning is performed via a learning rule with ""eligibility traces"", which hold a history of synaptic activity before being converted into changes in synaptic strength upon neuromodulator activation. Before training, the network responds to incoming stimuli, and contains no memory of any particular sequence. After training, presentation of only the first element in that sequence is sufficient for the network to recall an entire learned representation of the sequence. An extended version of the model also demonstrates the ability to successfully learn and recall non-Markovian sequences.

Deficits in olfactory perception and aggregation of -Syn in the olfactory bulb (OB) are observed during early stages of PD, and have been associated with the PD prodrome, before onset of the classic motor deficits. -Syn fibrils injected into the OB of mice cause progressive propagation of -Syn pathology throughout the olfactory system and are coupled to olfactory perceptual deficits. We hypothesized that accumulation of pathogenic -Syn in the OB impairs neural activity in the olfactory system. To address this, we monitored spontaneous and odor-evoked local field potential dynamics in awake wild type mice simultaneously in the OB and piriform cortex (PCX) one, two, and three months following injection of pathogenic preformed -Syn fibrils in the OB. We detected -Syn pathology in both the OB and PCX. We also observed that the presence of -Syn pathology, triggered by -Syn fibril injection, influenced certain oscillatory spectral bands in these regions. These changes in neural activity occurred with region specificity, and in some cases transiently relative to the number of months that had elapsed after injection. Together, we provide evidence that -Syn pathology in the olfactory system impacts in vivo neural activity and provides initial insights into its network-level effects.

Studies have found aberrant synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity during the early stages of brain development and have suggested that these contribute to an increased risk for ASD. STEP is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates synaptic plasticity and is implicated in several cognitive disorders. Here we test the hypothesis that STEP may contribute to some of the aberrant behaviors present in the VPA-induced mouse model of ASD. In utero VPA exposure of pregnant dams results in autistic-like behavior in the pups, which is associated with a significant increase in the STEP expression in the prefrontal cortex. The elevated STEP protein levels are correlated with increased dephosphorylation of STEP substrates GluN2B, Pyk2 and ERK, suggesting upregulated STEP activity. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of STEP rescues the sociability, repetitive and abnormal anxiety phenotypes commonly associated with ASD. These data suggest that STEP may play a role in the VPA model of ASD and STEP inhibition may have a potential therapeutic benefit in this model.

Hemidactylus mabouia in particular has become ubiquitous across tropical urban settings in the Western Hemisphere. H. mabouias ability to thrive in close proximity to humans has led to the rapid displacement of native geckos in urban areas, however the mechanisms driving this displacement remain understudied. Here we combine data from nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes, stomach contents, and morphometric analyses of traits associated with feeding and locomotion to test alternate hypotheses of displacement between H. mabouia and a native gecko, Phyllodactylus martini, on the island of Curacao. Consistent with expectations of direct food resource competition, we demonstrate substantial overlap of invertebrate prey resources between the species. Additionally, we found strong evidence from both diet content and stable isotope analyses that H. mabouia acts as a vertebrate predator, preying upon P. martini as well as other native and non-native reptiles. Finally, we show that H. mabouia possesses several morphological advantages, including larger sizes in feeding-associated traits and limb proportions that could offer a propulsive locomotor advantage on vertical surfaces. Together, these findings suggest the successful establishment of H. mabouia likely involves a combination of both exploitative interspecific competition and predation. Given the ubiquity of H. mabouia, illuminating the role of this species as both a competitor and a predator casts new concerns on the ecological and demographic impacts of this widespread urban invader.","NA"

Importantly, it has become an indispensable strategy to overcome resistance in antibiotics, anti-microbials, and anti-cancer drugs. Facing enormous chemical space and unclear design principles for small-molecule combinations, computational drug-combination design has not seen generative models to meet its potential to accelerate resistance-overcoming drug combination discovery.

ResultsWe have developed the first deep generative model for drug combination design, by jointly embedding graph-structured domain knowledge and iteratively training a reinforcement learning-based chemical graph-set designer. First, we have developed Hierarchical Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (HVGAE) trained end-to-end to jointly embed gene-gene, gene-disease, and disease-disease networks. Novel attentional pooling is introduced here for learning disease-representations from associated genes representations. Second, targeting diseases in learned representations, we have recast the drug-combination design problem as graph-set generation and developed a deep learning-based model with novel rewards. Specifically, besides chemical validity rewards, we have introduced novel generative adversarial award, being generalized sliced Wasserstein, for chemically diverse molecules with distributions similar to known drugs. We have also designed a network principle-based reward for drug combinations. Numerical results indicate that, compared to state-of-the-art graph embedding methods, HVGAE learns more informative and generalizable disease representations. Results also show that the deep generative models generate drug combinations following the principle across diseases. Case studies on four diseases show that network-principled drug combinations tend to have low toxicity. The generated drug combinations collectively cover the disease module similar to FDA-approved drug combinations and could potentially suggest novel systems-pharmacology strategies. Our method allows for examining and following network-based principle or hypothesis to efficiently generate disease-specific drug combinations in a vast chemical combinatorial space.

FE is a challenging phenotype to study, as it is complex and affected by many factors, such as metabolism, growth and activity level. Furthermore, testing for FE is expensive, as it requires costly equipment to measure feed intake of individual animals, making FE biomarkers valuable. Therefore, there has been a desire to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as biomarkers, to assist with improved selection and improve our biological understanding of FE. We have done a cis- and trans- eQTL (expressed quantitative trait loci) analysis, in a population of Danbred Durocs (N=11) and Danbred Landrace (N=27) using both a linear and Anova model. We used bootstrapping and enrichment analysis to validate and analyze our detected eQTLs. We identified 15 eQTLs with FDR < 0.01, affecting several genes found in previous studies of commercial pig breeds. Examples include IFI6, PRPF39, TMEM222, CSRNP1,PARK7 and MFF. The bootstrapping results showed statistically significant enrichment of eQTLs with p-value < 0.01 (p-value < 2.2x0-16) in both cis and trans-eQTLs. Based on this, enrichment analysis of top trans-eQTLs revealed high enrichment for gene categories and gene ontologies associated with genomic context and expression regulation. This includes transcription factors (p-value=1.0x10-13), DNA-binding (GO:0003677, p-value=8.9x10-14), DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700,) nucleus gene (GO:0005634, p-value<2.2x10-16), positive regulation of expression (GO:0010628), negative regulation of expression (GO:0010629, p-value<2.2x10-16).

Inference of species trees from either sets of gene family trees subject to duplication and loss, or allele trees subject to incomplete lineage sorting, can exhibit terraces in their solution space.

We investigated here whether the structure of such learning walks in the desert ant Cataglyphis fortis takes into account wind direction in conjunction with the learning of new visual information. Ants learnt to travel back and forth between their nest and a feeder, and we then introduced a black cylinder near their nest to induce learning walks in regular foragers. By doing this across days with different prevailing wind directions, we were able to probe how ants balance the influence of different sensory modalities. We found that (i) the ants outwards headings are influenced by the direction of the wind with their routes deflected in such a way that they will arrive downwind of their nest when homing, (ii) a novel object along the route induces learning walks in experienced ants and (iii) the structure of learning walks is shaped by the wind direction rather than the position of the visual cue.","NA"

While the pressure waves generated by FUS in this context have been extensively studied, the accompanying shear waves are often neglected due to the relatively high shear compliance of soft tissues. However, in bony structures such as the skull, acoustic pressure can also induce significant shear waves that could propagate outside the ultrasound focus. Here, we investigate wave propagation in the human cranium by means of a finite-element model that accounts for the anatomy, elasticity and viscoelasticity of the skull and brain. We show that, when a region on the frontal lobe is subjected to FUS, the skull acts as a wave guide for shear waves, resulting in their propagation to off-target structures such as the cochlea. This effect helps explain the off-target auditory responses observed during neuromodulation experiments and informs the development of mitigation and sham control strategies.","NA"

Quantifying turnover is particularly challenging, however, in multi-host, multi-parasite assemblages where undersampling is unavoidable, resulting in inflated estimates of turnover and uncertainty about its spatial scale. We developed and implemented a framework using null models to test for community turnover in avian haemosporidian communities of three sky islands in the southwestern United States. We screened 776 birds for haemosporidian parasites from three genera (Parahaemoproteus, Plasmodium, and Leucocytozoon) by amplifying and sequencing a mitochondrial DNA barcode. We detected infections in 280 birds (36.1%), sequenced 357 infections, and found a total of 99 parasite haplotypes. When compared to communities simulated from a regional pool, we observed more unique, single-mountain haplotypes and fewer haplotypes shared among three mountain ranges than expected, indicating that haemosporidian communities differ to some degree among adjacent mountain ranges. These results were robust even after pruning datasets to include only identical sets of host species, and they were consistent for two of the three haemosporidian genera. The two more distant mountain ranges were more similar to each other than the one located centrally, suggesting that the differences we detected were due to stochastic colonization-extirpation dynamics. These results demonstrate that avian haemosporidian communities of temperate-zone forests differ on relatively fine spatial scales associated with adjacent sky-islands. Null models are essential tools for detecting turnover in complex, undersampled, and poorly known systems.","NA"

The protein sequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher as compared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutations in the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of different clades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acid changes. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in the coding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The non-synonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed over different hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important di-amino acid change RG to KR was observed in ORF9 protein.

Such trends may cascade if future scientists gravitate towards study species with more data and resources already available. As new technologies emerge, do research studies employing these technologies continue these disparities? Here, using non-human primates as a case study, we first identified disparities in recently-generated massively-parallel genomic sequencing data and we then conducted interviews with the scientists who produced these data to learn their motivations when selecting species for study. Specifically, we tested whether variables including publication history and conservation status were significantly correlated with publicly-available sequence data in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. Of the 179.6 terabases (Tb) of sequence data in this database for 519 non-human primate species, 135 Tb (~75%) were from only five species: rhesus macaques, olive baboons, green monkeys, chimpanzees, and crab-eating macaques. The strongest individual predictors of the amount of genomic data were the total number of non-medical scholarly publications (linear regression; r2=0.37; P=6.15x10-12) and number of medical publications (r2=0.27; P=9.27x10-9). In a generalized linear model, the number of non-medical publications (P=0.00064) and closer phylogenetic distance to humans (P=0.024) were the most predictive of the amount of genomic sequence data. We interviewed 33 authors of genomic data-producing publications and analyzed their responses using a grounded theory approach. Consistent with our quantitative results, authors mentioned that their choices of species were motivated by sample accessibility, prior published work, and perceived relevance (especially health-related) to humans. Our mixed-methods approach helped us to identify and contextualize some of the driving factors behind species-uneven patterns of scientific research, which can now be considered by funding agencies, scientific societies, and research teams aiming to align their broader goals with future data generation efforts.

While our study focused on factors influencing non-human primate genomic sequence data, similar questions can be asked about how the scientific community engages with research projects more broadly. Our goal is to bring attention to the diversity of factors that influence scientists as they plan their projects, so that this process can be considered in the future by research groups and funding agencies aiming to align their broader goals with future data generation efforts.","NA"

The genetics, phenotypic characteristics, and biogeography are all consistent with previous reports of tetraploid peanut originating in Southeast Bolivia. Analysis of the genotype data indicates an early genetic radiation, followed by regional distribution of major genetic classes through South America, and then a global dissemination that retains much of the early genetic diversity in peanut. Comparison of the genotypic data relative to alleles from the diploid progenitors also indicates that subgenome exchanges, both large and small, have been major contributors to the genetic diversity in peanut.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) do not code for, but control gene expression with tissue specificity. However, their role in T-cell alloimmunity is unknown. We performed RNA-seq on donor T-cells from HSCT patients and found that increasing strength of allogeneic stimulation caused greater differential expression of lncRNAs. The differential expression was validated in an independent patient cohort, and also following ex vivo allogeneic stimulation of healthy human T-cells. Linc00402, a novel, conserved lncRNA, was identified as the most differentially expressed and was enriched 88 fold in human T-cells. Mechanistically, it was mainly located in the cytoplasm, and its expression was rapidly reduced following T-cell activation. Consistent with this, tacrolimus preserved the expression of Linc00402 following T-cell activation, and lower levels of Linc00402 were found in patients who subsequently went on to develop acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). The dysregulated expression of Linc00402 was also validated in murine T-cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Functional studies using multiple modalities to deplete Linc00402 in both mouse and human T-cells, demonstrated a critical role for Linc00402 in the T-cell proliferative response to an allogeneic stimulus but not a non-specific anti-CD3/CD28 stimulus. Thus, our studies identified Linc00402 as a novel, conserved regulator of allogeneic T-cell function. Because of its T-cell specific expression and its impact on allogeneic T-cell responses, targeting Linc00402 may improve outcomes after allogeneic HSC and solid organ transplantation.

Despite widespread efforts to bring more microorganisms into culture, the large majority of taxa either remain uncultivated or lack isolates from diverse geographic locales. Furthermore, we have little understanding of the factors that influence relative cultivation success for any particular taxon. We paired large scale dilution-to-extinction (DTE) cultivation with microbial community analysis and DTE modeling to expand the phylogenetic and geographic diversity of cultivated bacterioplankton and to evaluate the success of DTE cultivation for isolating abundant taxa. Here we report the results from 17 DTE experiments totaling 7,820 individual incubations over three years that resulted in 328 repeatably transferable cultures. Comparison of isolates to microbial community taxonomic profiles of source waters indicated that we successfully isolated 5% of the observed bacterioplankton taxa across all 17 sites. 43% and 26% of our isolates matched operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and amplicon single nucleotide variants (ASVs), respectively, within the top 50 most abundant taxa observed during the study. Isolates included those from previously uncultivated clades such as SAR11 LD12 and Actinobacteria acIV, as well as geographically novel members from other ecologically important groups like SAR11 subclade III, HIMB59 Alphaproteobacteria, SAR116, OM43, and HIMB11-type Roseobacter spp.. The effort resulted in the first isolates in eight genera and seven species. We also developed a new model of DTE cultivation to evaluate viability of taxa based on the relationship between relative abundance and cultivation success. The model i) revealed minimum levels of wells required for successful isolation of taxa amenable to growth on our media, and ii) identified several important and abundant taxa such as SAR11 with low viability that likely impacts cultivation success. By incorporating predicted, measured, or assumed viability in an iterative manner, we can now provide a statistically constrained number of attempts necessary for successful cultivation of a given taxon on a defined medium based on relative abundance.

ImportanceEven before the coining of the term ""great plate count anomaly"" in the 1980s, scientists had noted the discrepancy between the number of microorganisms observed under the microscope and the number of colonies that grew on traditional agar media. New cultivation approaches have reduced this disparity, resulting in the isolation of some of the ""most wanted"" bacterial lineages. Nevertheless, the vast majority of microorganisms remain uncultured, hampering progress towards answering fundamental biological questions about many important microorganisms. Furthermore, few studies have evaluated the underlying factors influencing cultivation success, limiting our ability to improve cultivation efficacy. Our work details the use of dilution-to-extinction (DTE) cultivation to expand the phylogenetic and geographic diversity of available axenic cultures. We also provide a new model of the DTE approach that uses cultivation results and natural abundance information to predict taxon-specific viability and iteratively constrain DTE experimental design to improve cultivation success.","NA"

However, fundamental and translational studies require a better understanding of TRPC1/4/5 channel regulation by endogenous and exogenous factors. Although several potent and selective TRPC1/4/5 modulators have been reported, the paucity of mechanistic insights into their modes-of-action remains a barrier to the development of new chemical probes and drug candidates. The xanthine class of modulators includes the most potent and selective TRPC1/4/5 inhibitors described to date, as well as TRPC5 activators. Our previous studies suggest that xanthines interact with a, so far, elusive pocket of TRPC1/4/5 channels that is essential to channel gating.

Here we report the first structure of a small molecule-bound TRPC1/4/5 channel - human TRPC5 in complex with the xanthine Pico145 - to 3.0 [A]. We found that Pico145 binds to a conserved lipid binding site of TRPC5, where it displaces a bound phospholipid.

While the melanopsin-containing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are thought to play a role, how cone and melanopsin signals are integrated in this pathway to produce visual discomfort is poorly understood.

We studied 60 people: 20 without headache and 20 each with interictal photophobia from migraine with or without aura. Participants viewed pulses of spectral change that selectively targeted melanopsin, the cones, or both, and rated the degree of visual discomfort produced by these stimuli while we also recorded pupil responses.

We examined the data within a model that describes how cone and melanopsin signals are weighted and combined at the level of the retina, and how this combined signal is transformed into a rating of discomfort or pupil response. Our results indicate that people with migraine do not differ from headache-free controls in the manner in which melanopsin and cone signals are combined. Instead, people with migraine demonstrate an amplification of integrated ipRGC signals for discomfort. This effect of migraine is selective for ratings of visual discomfort, in that an amplification of pupil responses was not seen in the migraine group, nor were group differences found in surveys of other behaviors putatively linked to ipRGC function (chronotype, seasonal sensitivity, presence of a photic sneeze reflex).

By revealing a dissociation in the amplification of discomfort versus pupil response, our findings suggest a post-retinal alteration in processing of ipRGC signals for photophobia in migraine.

SignificanceThe melanopsin-containing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) may contribute to photophobia in migraine. We measured visual discomfort and pupil responses to cone and melanopsin stimulation--the photoreceptor inputs to the ipRGCs--in people with and without migraine. We find that people with migraine do not differ from those without headaches in how cone and melanopsin signals are weighted and combined to produce visual discomfort. Instead, migraine is associated with an amplification of ipRGC signals for discomfort. This effect of migraine upon ipRGC signals is limited to photophobia, as we did not find an enhancement of pupil responses or a change in other behaviors linked to ipRGC function. Our findings suggest a post-retinal amplification of ipRGC signals for photophobia in migraine.","NA"

Griffith","Brandeis University","2020-04-18",1,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","neuroscience","Dissociation between the output of the circadian clock and external environmental cues is a major cause of human cognitive dysfunction. While the effects of ablation of the molecular clock on memory have been studied in many systems, little has been done to test the role of specific clock circuit output signals. To address this gap, we examined the effects of mutation of Pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf) and its receptor, Pdfr on associative memory in male and female Drosophila. Loss of PDF signaling significantly decreases the ability to form associative memory. Appetitive short-term memory (STM), which in wildtype is time-of-day (TOD)-independent, is decreased across the day by mutation of Pdf or Pdfr, but more substantially in the morning than in the evening. This defect is due to PDFR expression in adult neurons outside the core clock circuit and the mushroom body Kenyon cells. The acquisition of a TOD difference in mutants implies the existence of multiple oscillators that act to normalize memory formation across the day for appetitive processes. Interestingly, aversive STM requires PDF but not PDFR, suggesting that there are valence-specific pathways downstream of PDF that regulate memory formation. These data argue that the circadian clock uses circuit-specific and molecularly diverse output pathways to enhance the ability of animals to optimize responses to changing conditions.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFrom humans to invertebrates, cognitive processes are influenced by organisms internal circadian clocks, the pace of which is linked to the solar cycle. Disruption of this link is increasingly common (e.g. jetlag, social jetlag disorders) and causes cognitive impairments that are costly and long-lasting. A detailed understanding of how the internal clock regulates cognition is critical for the development of therapeutic methods. Here, we show for the first time that olfactory associative memory in Drosophila requires signaling by Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), a neuromodulatory signaling peptide produced only by circadian clock circuit neurons. We also find a novel role for the clock circuit in stabilizing appetitive sucrose/odor memory across the day.","NA"

CuII(atsm) consistently and reproducibly ameliorates neurodegeneration in mutant SOD1 mouse models of ALS where its neuroprotective activity has been ascribed in part to improving availability of copper to essential cuproenzymes. However, SOD1 mutations cause only ~2% of ALS cases with most cases being of unknown aetiology. Therapeutic pertinence of CuII(atsm) to sporadic ALS is therefore unclear.

MethodsWe assayed post-mortem spinal cord tissue from sporadic cases of ALS for the anatomical and biochemical distribution of copper, the expression of genes involved in copper handling, and the activities of cuproenzymes.

ResultsThe natural distribution of copper is disrupted in sporadic ALS. The ALS-affected tissue has a molecular signature consistent with an unsatiated requirement for copper and cuproenzyme activity is affected. Copper levels are decreased in the ventral grey matter, the primary anatomical site of neuronal loss in ALS.

InterpretationMice expressing mutant SOD1 recapitulate salient features of ALS. The unsatiated requirement for copper that is evident in these mice is a biochemical target for CuII(atsm). Evidences provided here for disrupted copper bioavailability in human cases of sporadic ALS indicate that a therapeutic mechanism for CuII(atsm) involving copper bioavailability is pertinent to sporadic cases of ALS, and not just those involving mutant SOD1.","NA"

Diffusion tensor imaging was performed at baseline in 90 clinically normal older adults (aged 54-86). We report on graph theory-based analyses of diffusion tensor imaging tract-derived connectivity. The machine learning approach was used to predict the rate of cognitive decline from white matter connectivity data. The reduced efficacy of white matter networks could predict the performance of these cognitive domains except memory. The predicted scores were significantly correlated with the real scores. For the local regions for predicting the cognitive changes, the right precuneus, left inferior parietal lobe and cuneus are the most important regions for predicting monthly change of executive function; some left partial and occipital regions are the most important for the changed of attention; the right frontal and temporal regions are the most important for the changed of language.

So far, research has mostly neglected the learning dynamics and variability of behavior during extinction learning and instead focused on a few response types that were studied by population averages. Here, we take a different approach by analyzing the trial-by-trial dynamics of operant extinction learning in both pigeons and a computational model. The task involved discriminant operant conditioning in context A, extinction in context B, and a return to context A to test the context-dependent return of the conditioned response (ABA renewal). By studying single learning curves across animals under repeated sessions of this paradigm, we uncovered a rich variability of behavior during extinction learning: (1) Pigeons prefer the unrewarded alternative choice in one-third of the sessions, predominantly during the very first extinction session an animal encountered. (2) In later sessions, abrupt transitions of behavior at the onset of context B emerge, and (3) the renewal effect decays as sessions progress. While these results could be interpreted in terms of rule learning mechanisms, we show that they can be parsimoniously accounted for by a computational model based only on associative learning between stimuli and actions. Our work thus demonstrates the critical importance of studying the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning in individual sessions, and the unexpected power of ""simple"" associative learning processes.

Significance StatementOperant conditioning is essential for the discovery of purposeful actions, but once a stimulus-response association is acquired, the ability to extinguish it in response to altered reward contingencies is equally important. These processes also play a fundamental role in the development and treatment of pathological behaviors such as drug addiction, overeating and gambling. Here we show that extinction learning is not limited to the cessation of a previously reinforced response, but also drives the emergence of complex and variable choices that change from learning session to learning session. At first sight, these behavioral changes appear to reflect abstract rule learning, but we show in a computational model that they can emerge from ""simple"" associative learning.","NA"

To motivate the idea of optimality, we compare the performance of designs optimized using two model-based criteria related to the probability of capture.

Our results suggest that regulatory information is distributed throughout most of a developmental enhancer and that parameters of gene expression--levels, location, and state--are convolved. The widespread pleiotropic effects of most mutations and the codependency of outputs may constrain the evolvability of developmental enhancers. Consistent with these observations, comparisons of diverse drosophilids reveal mainly stasis and apparent biases in the phenotypes influenced by this enhancer. Developmental enhancers may encode a much higher density of regulatory information than has been appreciated previously, which may impose constraints on regulatory evolution.

However, predicting the long-term transformations of communities following an invasion remains a challenging endeavour. We propose an analytical method that uses community structure and invader dynamical features to predict when these impacts can be large, and show it to be applicable across a wide class of dynamical models. Our approach reveals that short-term invasion success and long-term consequences are two distinct axes of variation controlled by different properties of both invader and resident community. Whether a species can invade is controlled by its invasion fitness, which depends on environmental conditions and direct interactions with resident species. But whether this invasion will cause significant transformations, such as extinctions or a regime shift, depends on a specific measure of indirect feedbacks that may involve the entire resident community. Our approach applies to arbitrarily complex communities, from few competing phenotypes in adaptive dynamics to large nonlinear food webs. It hints at new questions to ask as part of any invasion analysis, and suggests that long-term indirect interactions are key determinants of invasion outcomes.","NA"

We here investigate the statistical implications on rare variant association testing with a binary trait when combining together heterogeneous studies, defined as studies with potentially different disease proportion and different frequency of variant carriers. We study and compare in simulations the type 1 error control and power of the naive Score test, the saddlepoint approximation to the score test (SPA test), and the BinomiRare test in a range of settings, focusing on low numbers of variant carriers. Taking into account test performance as well as computation considerations, we develop recommendations for association analysis of rare genetic variants. We show that the Score test is preferred when the case proportion in the sample is 50%. Otherwise, for very low number of carriers, BinomiRare is preferred due to computational efficiency and type 1 error control. When there are at least 90 carriers in the combined sample, the SPA test generally controls the type 1 error and is preferred over BinomiRare due to higher power and wider implementation in software packages. Finally, we recommend to not sample controls in order to generate more balanced case-control ratio, rather, to use appropriate analytic methods. Sampling of controls reduces power.","NA"

Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of 8,405 genes linked with 35,074 human-specific neuro-regulatory single-nucleotide changes (hsSNCs) revealed a staggering breadth of significant associations with morphological structures, physiological processes, and pathological conditions of Modern Humans. Significantly enriched traits include more than 1,000 anatomically-distinct regions of the adult human brain, many different types of cells and tissues, more than 200 common human disorders and more than 1,000 records of rare diseases. Thousands of genes connected with neuro-regulatory hsSNCs have been identified, which represent essential genetic elements of the autosomal inheritance and offspring survival phenotypes. A total of 1,494 hsSNC- linked genes are associated with either autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance and 2,273 hsSNC-linked genes have been associated with premature death, embryonic lethality, as well as pre-, peri-, neo-, and post-natal lethality phenotypes of both complete and incomplete penetrance. Differential GSEA implemented on hsSNC-linked loci and associated genes identify 7,990 genes linked to evolutionary distinct classes of human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS), expression of a majority of which (5,389 genes; 67%) is regulated by stem cell-associated retroviral sequences (SCARS). Interrogations of the MGI database revealed readily available mouse models tailored for precise experimental definitions of functional effects of hsSNCs and SCARS on genes causally affecting thousands of mammalian phenotypes and implicated in hundreds of common and rare human disorders. These observations suggest that a preponderance of human-specific traits evolved under a combinatorial regulatory control of HSRS and neuro-regulatory loci harboring hsSNCs that are fixed in humans, distinct from other primates, and located in differentially-accessible chromatin regions during brain development.","NA"

This procedure is problematic for multisensory speech perception since audiovisual speech and auditory-only speech are easily intelligible but visual-only speech is not. To overcome this confound, we developed intracranial encephalography (iEEG) deconvolution. Individual stimuli always contained both auditory and visual speech but jittering the onset asynchrony between modalities allowed for the time course of the unisensory responses and the interaction between them to be independently estimated. We applied this procedure to electrodes implanted in human epilepsy patients (both male and female) over the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), a brain area known to be important for speech perception. iEEG deconvolution revealed sustained, positive responses to visual-only speech and larger, phasic responses to auditory-only speech. Confirming results from scalp EEG, responses to audiovisual speech were weaker than responses to auditory- only speech, demonstrating a subadditive multisensory neural computation. Leveraging the spatial resolution of iEEG, we extended these results to show that subadditivity is most pronounced in more posterior aspects of the pSTG. Across electrodes, subadditivity correlated with visual responsiveness, supporting a model in visual speech enhances the efficiency of auditory speech processing in pSTG. The ability to separate neural processes may make iEEG deconvolution useful for studying a variety of complex cognitive and perceptual tasks.

Significance statementUnderstanding speech is one of the most important human abilities. Speech perception uses information from both the auditory and visual modalities. It has been difficult to study neural responses to visual speech because visual-only speech is difficult or impossible to comprehend, unlike auditory-only and audiovisual speech. We used intracranial encephalography (iEEG) deconvolution to overcome this obstacle. We found that visual speech evokes a positive response in the human posterior superior temporal gyrus, enhancing the efficiency of auditory speech processing.","NA"

Upon arrival in the MB, sensory information undergoes a profound transformation. Olfactory projection neurons (PNs), the main MB input, exhibit broadly tuned, sustained, and stereotyped responses to odorants; in contrast, their postsynaptic targets in the MB, the Kenyon cells (KCs), are nonstereotyped, narrowly tuned, and only briefly responsive to odorants. Theory and experiment have suggested that this transformation is implemented by random connectivity between KCs and PNs. However, this hypothesis has been challenging to test, given the difficulty of mapping synaptic connections between large numbers of neurons to achieve a unified view of neuronal network structure. Here we used a recent whole-brain electron microscopy (EM) volume of the adult fruit fly to map large numbers of PN-to-KC connections at synaptic resolution. Comparison of the observed connectome to precisely defined null models revealed unexpected network structure, in which a subset of food-responsive PN types converge on individual downstream KCs more frequently than expected. The connectivity bias is consistent with the neurogeometry: axons of the overconvergent PNs tend to arborize near one another in the MB main calyx, making local KC dendrites more likely to receive input from those types. Computational modeling of the observed PN-to-KC network showed that input from the overconvergent PN types is better discriminated than input from other types. These results suggest an 'associative fovea' for olfaction, in that the MB is wired to better discriminate more frequently occurring and ethologically relevant combinations of food-related odors.","NA"

The MEIS1 oncogenic transcription factor is regulated by a Frequently Interacting Region (FIRE). This FIRE is present in normal bone marrow samples, and an AML sample with high MEIS1 levels. However, it is absent in two AML samples that show low MEIS1 levels. CRISPR excision of the FIRE led to loss of MEIS1 and reduced cell growth.

Parasites, ubiquitous in food webs, are known to affect simultaneously host vulnerability to predation and host energy contents, thereby affecting profitabilities. In this work, we study the eco-evolutionary consequences of prey infection on predator diet. We also analyze the consequences for coexistence between prey, predators and parasites. We model a trophic module with one predator and two prey species, one of these prey being infected by a parasite, and distinguish between two effects of infection: a decrease in host fecundity (virulence effect) and an increase in vulnerability to predation (interaction effect). Predator foraging may evolve toward specialist or generalist strategies, the latter being less efficient on a given resource. We show that the virulence effect leads to specialisation on the non-infected prey while the interaction effect, by increasing prey profitability, favors specialisation on the infected prey. Combining the two effects at intermediate intensities promotes either generalist predators or the diversification of foraging strategies (coexistence of specialists), depending of trade-off shape. We then investigate how the evolution of predator diet affects the niche overlap between predator and parasite. We show that interaction effects systematically lead to a high niche overlap, ultimately resulting in the loss of the parasite. Virulence effects conversely favor coexistence by allowing a separation of the predator and parasite niches.","NA"

However, predicting the effect of drug combinations is still challenging. The combined potency of drugs determines the drug interaction, which is classified as synergistic, additive, antagonistic, or suppressive. While probabilistic, non-mechanistic models exist, there is currently no biophysical model that can predict antibiotic interactions. Here, we present a physiologically relevant model of the combined action of antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis by targeting the ribosome. This model captures the kinetics of antibiotic binding and transport, and uses bacterial growth laws to predict growth in the presence of antibiotic combinations. We find that this biophysical model can produce all drug interaction types except suppression. We show analytically that antibiotics which cannot bind to the ribosome simultaneously generally act as substitutes for one another, leading to additive drug interactions. Previously proposed null expectations for higher-order drug interactions follow as a limiting case of our model. We further extend the model to include the effects of direct physical or allosteric interactions between individual drugs on the ribosome. Notably, such direct interactions profoundly change the combined drug effect, depending on the kinetic parameters of the drugs used. The model makes additional predictions for the effects of resistance genes on drug interactions and for interactions between ribosome-targeting antibiotics and antibiotics with other targets. These findings enhance our understanding of the interplay between drug action and cell physiology and are a key step toward a general framework for predicting drug interactions.","NA"

Cells undergoing metastasis use phenotypic plasticity to adapt to their changing environmental conditions and avoid therapy and immune response. Reversible transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes - Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and its reverse Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET) - form a key axis of phenotypic plasticity during metastasis and therapy resistance. Recent studies have shown that the cells undergoing EMT/MET can attain one or more hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotypes, the process of which is termed as partial EMT/MET. Cells in hybrid E/M phenotype(s) can be more aggressive than those in either epithelial or mesenchymal state. Thus, it is crucial to identify the factors and regulatory networks enabling such hybrid E/M phenotypes. Here, employing an integrated computational-experimental approach, we show that the transcription factor NFATc can inhibit the process of complete EMT, thus stabilizing the hybrid E/M phenotype. It increases the range of parameters enabling the existence of a hybrid E/M phenotype, thus behaving as a phenotypic stability factor (PSF). However, unlike previously identified PSFs, it does not increase the mean residence time of the cells in hybrid E/M phenotypes, as shown by stochastic simulations; rather it enables the co-existence of epithelial, mesenchymal and hybrid E/M phenotypes and transitions among them. Clinical data suggests the effect of NFATc on patient survival in a tissue-specific or context-dependent manner. Together, our results indicate that NFATc behaves as a non-canonical phenotypic stability factor for a hybrid E/M phenotype.","NA"

Though age and comorbidities severely increase case fatality rates, the host factors that influence resistance or susceptibility to infection with highly pathogenic human CoVs are unknown. Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded (ds) RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication. Here we show that COVID-19 patient samples of SARS-CoV-2 conserve the invariant sequence of the CoV macrodomain, an ADP-ribosylhydrolase domain previously shown to counteract innate immunity to both mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model CoV, and SARS-CoV.

Obesity and diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. It has been shown that for viral entry into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors present on the cells. We aimed to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates lipid metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation of ACE2, specifically in obesity. In our study, through the re-analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, we first found that lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the SOC3 gene which is involved in regulation of inflammation and inhibition of leptin signaling. This is of interest as viruses may hijack host lipid metabolism to allow completion of their viral replication cycles. Furthermore, a mouse model of diet-induced obesity showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lungs which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for sterol response element binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP). Suppression of Srebp1 showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lung. Together our results suggest that the dysregulated lipogenesis and the subsequently high ACE2 expression in obese patients might be the mechanism underlying the increased risk for severe complications in those patients when infected by SARS-CoV-2.","NA"

ACE2 is a receptor protein of SARS- CoV-2, and TMPRSS2 promotes virus proliferation and transmission. Some patients developed multiple organ dysfunction syndromes other than lungs. Therefore, studying the viral susceptibility of other organs is important for a deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis.

MethodsThe advantage of scRNA-seq data is the identification of cell types by clustering the gene expression of cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in AT2 of lungs, we compared the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels of cell types from 31 organs, with AT2 of lungs to evaluate the risk of the viral infection using scRNA-seq data.

FindingsFor the first time, we found the brain, gall bladder, and fallopian tube are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Besides, the nose, heart, small intestine, large intestine, esophagus, testis and kidney are also identified to be high-risk organs with high expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Moreover, the susceptible organs are grouped into three risk levels based on the TMPRSS2 expression. As a result, the respiratory system, digestive system and reproductive system are at the top-risk level to COVID-19 infection.

InterpretationThis study provides evidence for COVID-19 infection in the human nervous system, digestive system, reproductive system, respiratory system, circulatory system and urinary system using scRNA-seq data, which helps for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients.","NA"

In IBD-prone interleukin-10 deficient (IL-10 KO) mice, the absence of gut microbiota under germ-free (GF) conditions prevents IBD development. However, in aged GF IL-10 KO mice (>6-months of age), polyuria and pancreatic lymphocytic infiltration resembling T1D lesions was observed. Approximately 50% of male and female mice above 6-months of age develop pancreatic immune cell infiltration, as compared to none in conventionally-raised and fecal microbiota transplanted (FMT) IL-10 KO counterparts. Immunofluorescence staining of islet infiltrates was positive for adaptive and innate immunological markers, including lymphoid and myeloid cell markers, which typically characterize autoimmune T1D lesions. A subset of GF IL-10 KO mice was also positive for insulin autoantibodies (IAA), but the majority of mice did not become diabetic. Our findings of early stage lymphocytic infiltrates in the pancreas and IAA in the absence of overt diabetes in GF IL-10 KO mice embody the early stages of T1D pathogenesis. As such, we propose that the presence of gut microbiota play a protective role against immune infiltration in the pancreas of genetically prone hosts.

In addition, we apply capCLIP to probe the consequences of phosphorylation of eIF4E, a modification whose function had remained unclear. Phosphorylation of eIF4E drives an overall reduction in eIF4E-mRNA association, and strikingly, the mRNAs most sensitive to phosphorylation possess short 5' UTRs. capCLIP provides a sensitive and comprehensive measure of cellular translational activity.

Alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas are characterized by the presence of a PAX-FOXO1 fusion protein and termed fusion-positive (FP-RMS); embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (ERMS) lack these fusions and are termed fusion-negative (FN-RMS).

Fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS) harbors PAX-FOXO1 fusion proteins and has a worse overall outcome compared to FN-RMS, underscoring the critical need to identify novel targets for this disease. While fusion proteins remain challenging therapeutic targets, recent studies have begun to reveal the key intersection of PAX-FOXO1 fusion proteins with the malignant epigenome, suggesting that epigenetic proteins may serve as novel targets in FP-RMS. Here, we investigate the contribution of the epigenetic regulator BMI1 to FP-RMS.

We examined RNA-seq tumor datasets and determined that BMI1 is robustly expressed in FP-RMS tumors, patient derived xenografts (PDXs), and cell lines. We depleted BMI1 using RNA interference and find that this leads to a marked decrease in cell growth. Next, we used two BMI1 inhibitors, PTC-209 and PTC-028, and showed that BMI1 inhibition decreases cell cycle progression and increases apoptosis in FP-RMS cell lines. In the in vivo setting, targeting BMI1 leads to decreased tumor growth. Mechanistically, we observe that BMI1 inhibition activates the tumor suppressive Hippo pathway. Collectively, these results identify BMI1 as a novel therapeutic vulnerability in FP-RMS and provide a foundation for further investigation of BMI1 in both FP-RMS and additional sarcoma histotypes.","NA"

Computational models that estimate the interaction strength of new drug-target pairs have the potential to expedite drug repurposing. Several models have been proposed for this task. However, these models represent the drugs as strings, which is not a natural way to represent molecules.

Npm1 heterozygosity produces features similar to those of MDS that progress to overt leukemia, and specific point mutations of Npm1 lead to bone marrow failure due to loss of hematopoietic stem cells. However, little is known about NPM1s role in mature, differentiated cells. Here we generated a conditional mouse mutant to inactivate Npm1 across the myelomonocytic lineage, and investigated its ability to influence macrophage maturation and function. We found that Npm1 is not required to maintain macrophage viability, while its loss in mature macrophages reduces production of reactive oxygen species, chemotactic properties and phagocytic capacity. Taking advantage of our recently established Npm1D180del mouse model of ribosome dysfunction and hematological disease, we identify cellular translation and rRNA 2-O-methlyation as a crucial element in controlling macrophage function. These analyses demonstrate a role for Npm1 in adult immune cells, and reveal the importance of translation regulation in macrophage function.

Our extensive evaluations in simulated and real datasets show that SMNN provides improved merging within the corresponding cell types across batches, leading to reduced differentiation across batches over MNN, Seurat v3, and LIGER.

Extremophile lineages inspire questions about how organisms can tolerate physiochemical stressors and whether the repeated colonization of extreme environments is facilitated by predictable and repeatable evolutionary innovations. We identified the mechanistic basis underlying convergent evolution of tolerance to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)--a toxicant that impairs mitochondrial function--across evolutionarily independent lineages of a fish (Poecilia mexicana, Poeciliidae) from H2S-rich springs. Using comparative biochemical and physiological analyses, we found that mitochondrial function is maintained in the presence of H2S in sulfide spring P. mexicana, but not ancestral lineages from nonsulfidic habitats, due to convergent adaptations in the primary toxicity target and a major detoxification enzyme. Genome-wide local ancestry analyses indicated that convergent evolution of increased H2S tolerance in different populations is likely caused by a combination of selection on standing genetic variation and de novo mutations. At a macroevolutionary scale, H2S tolerance in 10 independent lineages of sulfide spring fishes across multiple genera of Poeciliidae is correlated with the convergent modification and expression changes of genes associated with H2S toxicity and detoxification. Our results demonstrate that the modification of highly conserved physiological pathways associated with essential mitochondrial processes mediates tolerance to physiochemical stress. In addition, the same pathways, genes, and--in some instances--codons are implicated in H2S adaptation in lineages that span 40 million years of evolution.

Significance StatementSome organisms can tolerate environments lethal for most others, but we often do not know what adaptations allow them to persist and whether the same mechanisms underly adaptation in different lineages exposed to the same stressors. Investigating fish inhabiting springs rich in toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S), we show that tolerance is mediated by the modification of pathways that are inhibited by H2S and those that can detoxify it. Sulfide spring fishes across multiple genera have evolved similar modifications of toxicity targets and detoxification pathways, despite abundant lineage-specific variation. Our study highlights how constraints associated with the physiological consequences of a stressor limit the number of adaptive solutions and lead to repeatable evolutionary outcomes across organizational and evolutionary scales.","NA"

As a consequence, if a module can be improved only by rare and/or weak beneficial mutations, its adaptive evolution would stall. However, such evolutionary stalling has not been empirically demonstrated, and it is unclear to what extent stalling may limit the power of natural selection to improve modules. Here, we empirically characterize how natural selection improves the translation machinery (TM), an essential cellular module. We experimentally evolved populations of Escherichia coli with genetically perturbed TMs for 1,000 generations. Populations with severe TM defects initially adapted via mutations in the TM, but TM adaptation stalled within about 300 generations. We estimate that the genetic load in our populations incurred by residual TM defects ranges from 0.5 to 19%. Finally, we found evidence that both epistasis and the depletion of the pool of beneficial mutations contributed to evolutionary stalling. Our results suggest that cellular modules may not be fully optimized by natural selection despite the availability of adaptive mutations.","NA"

Yet, most germline genomic studies performed to date have focused on individuals of European ancestry. Ancestry-specific analyses of germline genomes are required to inform cancer genetic risk and prognosis for each ancestral group. Here, we investigate potentially germline pathogenic variants in cancer predisposition genes (CPG) and their somatic effects in patients across diverse ancestral backgrounds.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of germline genomic data of 9,899 patients from 33 cancer types generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project along with matching somatic genomic and transcriptomic data. By collapsing pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants to the gene level, we analyzed the association between variants in CPGs and cancer types within each ancestry. We also identified ancestry- specific predisposing variants and their associated somatic two-hit events and gene expression levels.

ResultsRecent genetic ancestry analysis classified the cohort of 9,899 cancer cases into individuals of primarily European, (N = 8,184, 82.7%), African (N = 966, 9.8%), East Asian (N = 649, 6.6%), South Asian (N=48, 0.5%), Native/Latin American (N=41, 0.4%), and admixed (N=11, 0.1%) ancestries. In the African ancestry, we discovered a potentially novel association of BRCA2 in lung squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 41.4 [95% CI, 6.1-275.6]; FDR = 0.002) along with the previously identified association of BRCA2 in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OR=8.5 [95% CI, 1.5-47.4]; FDR=0.045). Similarly, in the East Asian ancestry, we discovered one previously known association of BRIP1 in stomach adenocarcinoma (OR=12.8 [95% CI, 1.8-90.84]; FDR=0.038). Rare variant burden analysis further identified 7 suggestive associations for cancer-gene pairs in African ancestry individuals previously well described in European ancestry including SDHB in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, ATM in prostate adenocarcinoma, VHL in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, FH in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, and PTEN in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. Loss of heterozygosity was identified for 7 out of the 15 African ancestry carriers of predisposing variants. Further, tumors from the SDHB or BRCA2 carriers showed simultaneous allelic specific expression and low gene expression of their respective affected genes; and FH splice-site variant carriers showed mis-splicing of FH.

ConclusionWhile several predisposing genes are shared across patients, many pathogenic variants are found to be ancestry-specific and trigger somatic effects. Analysis of larger diverse ancestries genomic cohorts are required to pinpoint ancestry- specific genetic predisposition to inform personalized diagnosis and screening strategies.","NA"

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) leverage the sequence variations to bridge phenotypes and genotypes. However, their effectiveness is limited in species with high ploidy and large genomes, such as sugarcane. As an alternative, a regional heritability mapping (RHM) method can be used to capture genetic signals that may be missed by GWAS by combining genetic variance from neighboring regions. We used RHM to screen the sugarcane genome aiming to identify regions with higher heritability associated with agronomic traits. We considered percentage of fiber in sugarcane bagasse (FB), apparent percentage of sugarcane sucrose (PC), tonnes of pol per hectare (TPH), and tonnes of stalks per hectare (TSH).

MethodsSequence-capture data of 508 sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) clones from a breeding population under selection were processed for variant calling analysis using the sugarcane genome cultivar R570 as a reference. A set of 375,195 single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected after quality control. RHM was conducted by splitting the sugarcane genome into windows of 2 Mb length.

ResultsWe selected the windows explaining > 20% of the total genomic heritability for TPH (64 windows - 5,654 genes) and TSH (72 windows - 6,050 genes), and > 15% for PC (16 windows - 1,517 genes) and FB (17 windows - 1,615 genes). The top five windows that explained the highest genomic heritability ranged from 20.8 to 24.6% for FB (629 genes), 18.0 to 22.0% for PC (452 genes), 53.8 to 66.0% for TPH (705 genes), and 59.5 to 67.4% for TSH (413 genes). The functional annotation of genes included in those top five windows revealed a set of genes that encode enzymes that integrate carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways.

ConclusionsThe selection of windows that explained the large proportions of genomic heritability allowed us to identify genomic regions containing a set of genes that are related to the agronomic traits in sugarcane. These windows spanned a region of 58.38Mb, which corresponds to 14.28% of the reference assembly in the sugarcane genome. We contend that RHM can be used as an alternative method for sugarcane breeders to reduce the complexity of the sugarcane genome.","NA"

W.; Li, X.-A.","Xiang-An Li","University of Kentucky","2020-04-18",2,"cc_no","confirmatory results","immunology","Rational25-60% of septic patients experience relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) and glucocorticoid (GC) is frequently used in septic patients. However, the efficacy of GC therapy and whether the GC therapy should be based on the status of RAI are highly controversial. Critical barriers include technical limitations in properly identifying RAI in septic patients and a lack of RAI animal model.

ObjectivesWe established a new RAI animal model to test our hypothesis that precision medicine approach should be used for GC sepsis therapy - only applying GC to a subgroup of septic mice with RAI.

MethodsWe generated SF1CreSR-BIfl/fl conditional knockout mice. The mice exhibited specific depletion of SR-BI expression in adrenal gland, resulting in a lack of production of inducible GC in response to ACTH stimulation or sepsis, but the mice had normal basal GC levels. Mice were treated with cecal ligation and puncture to develop sepsis. Mice were also supplemented with or without GC to study the effect of GC in sepsis therapy. Plasma and organs were collected for biochemical assays. BODIPY  FL-conjugated Escherichia coli was used for phagocytosis assay. Macrophages were used to study effects of GC on inflammatory responses.

Measurements and Main ResultsUsing SF1CreSR-BIfl/fl mice as a RAI model, we found that mice with RAI were susceptible to CLP-induced sepsis compared to controls (6.7% survival in SF1CreSR-BIfl/fl mice versus 86.4% in SR-BIfl/fl mice; p=0.0001). Supplementation of hydrocortisone significantly improved survival in CLP-treated SF1CreSR-BIfl/fl mice. Surprisingly, wild type mice receiving GC treatment exhibited significantly less survival compared to wild type mice without GC treatment. We further found that, in contrast to wild type mice which displayed a well-controlled systemic inflammatory response, the mice with RAI featured a persisted systemic response as shown by high levels of plasma inflammatory cytokines/chemokines 20 hours post CLP, and supplementation of GC kept the inflammatory response under control. In vitro analysis revealed that stress level of GC is required to suppress inflammatory response through modulating MAPK signaling in macrophages.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate that RAI is a risk factor and an endotype for sepsis, and GC treatment benefits mice with RAI but harms mice without RAI. We further demonstrate that inducible GC functions to keep the systemic inflammatory response under control through modulating MAPK signaling, but mice with RAI lose such protection and supplementation of GC regains the protection. Our study provides a proof of concept to support the use of a precision medicine approach for sepsis therapy - selectively applying GC therapy for a subgroup of patients with RAI.","NA"

Using a urinary tract infection model, we validated our transcriptomic analyses, finding that MacM macrophages phagocytosed more bacteria and polarized to a more anti-inflammatory profile, whereas the MacL subset died rapidly during infection. During resolution, monocyte-derived cells contributed to tissue-resident macrophage pools and both subsets acquired transcriptional profiles distinct from naive macrophages.

To date, there are no known therapeutic or preventative agents to target CoVs. Though age and comorbidities severely increase case fatality rates, the host factors that influence resistance or susceptibility to infection with highly pathogenic human CoVs are unknown. Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded (ds) RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication. Here we show that COVID-19 patient samples of SARS-CoV-2 conserve the invariant sequence of the CoV macrodomain, an ADP-ribosylhydrolase domain previously shown to counteract innate immunity to both mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model CoV, and SARS-CoV. RNA sequence analysis of cell lines, infected ferrets, and a deceased patients lung shows that a set of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family members are induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection; these PARPs include enzymes required for the innate immune response to MHV. Further, we show that MHV infection induces an attack on host cell nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). The data indicate that overexpression of a virally induced PARP, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host cell NAD metabolism and that NAD+ boosting strategies differ in their efficacy to restore PARP10 function. The data suggest that boosting cytoplasmic but not nuclear NAD+ may restore antiviral PARP functions to support innate immunity to CoVs and other viruses susceptible to PARP-mediated antiviral activity.","NA"

Studies have found aberrant synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity during the early stages of brain development and have suggested that these contribute to an increased risk for ASD. STEP is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates synaptic plasticity and is implicated in several cognitive disorders. Here we test the hypothesis that STEP may contribute to some of the aberrant behaviors present in the VPA-induced mouse model of ASD. In utero VPA exposure of pregnant dams results in autistic-like behavior in the pups, which is associated with a significant increase in the STEP expression in the prefrontal cortex. The elevated STEP protein levels are correlated with increased dephosphorylation of STEP substrates GluN2B, Pyk2 and ERK, suggesting upregulated STEP activity. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of STEP rescues the sociability, repetitive and abnormal anxiety phenotypes commonly associated with ASD. These data suggest that STEP may play a role in the VPA model of ASD and STEP inhibition may have a potential therapeutic benefit in this model.

The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion domains, is essential for the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals, which considered as the potential target organ of the virus. However, report about the expression of FURIN and ACE2 in oral tissues was limited. Methods: In order to investigate the potential infective channel of new coronavirus in oral cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and FURIN that mediate the new coronavirus entry into host cells in oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining experiment was performed to confirm the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in the protein level. Results: The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. IHC experiments revealed that both the ACE2-positive and FURIN-positive cells in the target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in fibroblasts, which further confirm the bioinformatics results. Conclusions: Based on these findings, we speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease.

In this work we successfully produced aligned and electrically conductive 3D collagen scaffolds using a freeze-drying approach. Conductive polypyrrole (PPy) microparticles were synthesized and directly mixed into a suspension of type I collagen and chondroitin sulfate followed by directional lyophilization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and confocal microscopy analyses showed that directional solidification resulted in scaffolds with longitudinally aligned macropores (transverse plane: 155 {+/-} 27 {micro}m, longitudinal plane: 218 {+/-} 49 {micro}m) with homogeneously-distributed PPy content. Chronopotentiometry verified that PPy incorporation resulted in a five-fold increase in conductivity when compared to non-PPy containing collagen scaffolds without detrimentally affecting C2C12 mouse myoblast metabolic activity. Furthermore, the aligned scaffold microstructure provided contact guidance cues that directed myoblast growth and organization.

In the swarming state, bacterial films display several characteristics of active matter including intense and persistence long-ranged flock like motions and strong fluctuating velocity fields with significant vorticity. Additionally swarm fronts are typically dynamically evolving interfaces. Many of these fronts typically separate motile active domains from passive highly frictional regions comprised of dead or non-motile bacteria. Here, we study the evolving structural features of such active-passive interfaces in swarming Serratia marcesens. We expose localized regions of the swarm to high intensity wide-spectrum light and create large domains comprised of tightly packed immotile bacteria. When the light source is turned off, swarming bacteria outside this region advance into this highly frictional domain and continuously reshape the interphase boundary. Integrating results from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and from intensity based image analysis, we find that the evolving interface has both a clearly defined width and roughness. Correlations between spatially separated surface fluctuations and damping of the same are influenced by the interaction of the interfacial region with adjacently located collective flows. Dynamical growth exponents characterizing the spatiotemporal features of the surface are extracted and are found to differ from classically expected values for passive growth or erosion. To isolate the effects of hydrodynamic interactions generated by collective flows and that arising from steric interactions, we propose and analyze agent-based simulations with full hydrodynamics of rod-shaped, self-propelled particles. Our computations capture qualitative features of the swarm and predict correlation lengths consistent with experiments. Combining experiments with simulations, we conclude that hydrodynamic and steric interactions enable different modes of surface dynamics, morphology and thus front invasion.","NA"

Two of these organelles, the lysosome and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), play crucial roles in regulating cellular homeostasis and organismal health. The lysosome contains various enzymes devoted to the hydrolysis of specific substrates, and dysfunctions of these hydrolases and their related metabolic processes are implicated in many diseases 1. On the other hand, ER is essential for protein synthesis and utilizes quality control mechanisms to maintain proteostasis. The metabolic status of the lysosome is now known to actively influence nuclear transcription and mitochondrial signaling 2-4. However, whether and how mechanistically lysosomal metabolic activities regulate ER proteostasis remain unclear. Here, we reported that RSH-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans RelA/SpoT Homolog (RSH) protein, carries a lysosomal NADPH phosphatase activity and acts through the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling to regulate ER proteostasis. We discovered that RSH-1 is localized to the lysosome. Its mutation reduces NADPH hydrolysis by the lysosome, leading to a protection against ER stress-induced lethality. We further revealed that this ER stress tolerance requires lysosomal vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (v-ATPase), and Rag GTPases and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) in the mTOR signaling pathway. Through transcriptome analysis, we discovered that the S6K activation by the RSH-1 mutation increases the basal expression of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, which is necessary for improving ER proteostasis. Moreover, we demonstrated the lysosomal localization of RSH-1 mammalian homolog and its conserved role in regulating mTOR signaling. Together, our findings reveal the key role of a specific lysosomal nucleotide hydrolase in regulating organellar coordination and also signaling mechanisms underlying this active regulation, and suggest that diseases resulted from deficiency in lysosomal hydrolases may be attributed to the distortion of signal transduction and organelle homeostasis.","NA"

Due to the environmental destruction and overfishing, the populations of this species have been under threat. It is important to have a reference genome to study the population genetics, domestic farming, and genetic resource protection. However, currently, there is no reference genome for Trachidermus fasciatus, which has greatly hurdled the studies on this species. In this study, we proposed to integrate nanopore long reads sequencing, Illumina short reads sequencing and Hi-C methods to thoroughly de novo assemble the genome of Trachidermus fasciatus. Our results provided a chromosome-level high quality genome assembly with a total length of about 543 Mb, and with N50 of 23 Mb. Based on de novo gene prediction and RNA sequencing information, a total of 38728 genes were found, including 23191 protein coding genes, 2149 small RNAs, 5572 rRNAs, and 7816 tRNAs. Besides, about 23% of the genome area is covered by the repetitive elements. Furthermore, The BUSCO evaluation of the completeness of the assembled genome is more than 96%, and the single base accuracy is 99.997%. Our study provided the first whole genome reference for the species of Trachidermus fasciatus, which might greatly facilitate the future studies on this species.","NA"

Our objective was to characterize the impact of implicit olfactory priming on inhibitory control towards food, in groups with different weight status. Ninety-two adults completed a modified Affective Shifting Task: they had to detect target stimuli and ignore distractor stimuli while being primed with non-attentively perceived odours. We measured reactivity and inhibitory control towards food pictures. Priming effects were observed on reactivity: participants with overweight and obesity were slower when primed with pear and pound cake odour respectively. Common inhibitory control patterns toward foods were observed between groups. We suggest that non-attentively perceived food cues influence bottom-up processing by activating distinguished mental representations according to weight status. Also, our data show that cognitive load influences inhibitory control toward foods. Those results contribute to understanding how the environment can influence eating behaviour in individuals with obesity.","NA"

Some important factors that determine shoal choice are shoal size, familiarity and species composition. However, individuals and species often exhibit distinct shoaling preferences. Individual differences in shoaling preferences may also be related to personality traits such as boldness and sociability. In this study, we examined the link between shoaling decisions and personality traits in a hatchery reared population of an endangered megafish, the Deccan Mahseer (Tor khudree). We found that this fish exhibits a distinct preference for larger shoals at ratios of 1:2 or greater. However, they did not prefer to associate with an isolated familiar individual over unfamiliar ones or with a member of their own species over an invasive species. Moreover, shoaling preferences in individuals did not correlate with their boldness or sociability. These results suggest that hatchery reared mahseers which are reintroduced into natural habitats may shoal with invasive species, negatively affecting their viability. Modifying social behaviour of mahseers by amending rearing practices may be a useful strategy to improve outcomes of restocking interventions.","NA"

Despite widespread efforts to bring more microorganisms into culture, the large majority of taxa either remain uncultivated or lack isolates from diverse geographic locales. Furthermore, we have little understanding of the factors that influence relative cultivation success for any particular taxon. We paired large scale dilution-to-extinction (DTE) cultivation with microbial community analysis and DTE modeling to expand the phylogenetic and geographic diversity of cultivated bacterioplankton and to evaluate the success of DTE cultivation for isolating abundant taxa. Here we report the results from 17 DTE experiments totaling 7,820 individual incubations over three years that resulted in 328 repeatably transferable cultures. Comparison of isolates to microbial community taxonomic profiles of source waters indicated that we successfully isolated 5% of the observed bacterioplankton taxa across all 17 sites. 43% and 26% of our isolates matched operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and amplicon single nucleotide variants (ASVs), respectively, within the top 50 most abundant taxa observed during the study. Isolates included those from previously uncultivated clades such as SAR11 LD12 and Actinobacteria acIV, as well as geographically novel members from other ecologically important groups like SAR11 subclade III, HIMB59 Alphaproteobacteria, SAR116, OM43, and HIMB11-type Roseobacter spp.. The effort resulted in the first isolates in eight genera and seven species. We also developed a new model of DTE cultivation to evaluate viability of taxa based on the relationship between relative abundance and cultivation success. The model i) revealed minimum levels of wells required for successful isolation of taxa amenable to growth on our media, and ii) identified several important and abundant taxa such as SAR11 with low viability that likely impacts cultivation success. By incorporating predicted, measured, or assumed viability in an iterative manner, we can now provide a statistically constrained number of attempts necessary for successful cultivation of a given taxon on a defined medium based on relative abundance.

ImportanceEven before the coining of the term ""great plate count anomaly"" in the 1980s, scientists had noted the discrepancy between the number of microorganisms observed under the microscope and the number of colonies that grew on traditional agar media. New cultivation approaches have reduced this disparity, resulting in the isolation of some of the ""most wanted"" bacterial lineages. Nevertheless, the vast majority of microorganisms remain uncultured, hampering progress towards answering fundamental biological questions about many important microorganisms. Furthermore, few studies have evaluated the underlying factors influencing cultivation success, limiting our ability to improve cultivation efficacy. Our work details the use of dilution-to-extinction (DTE) cultivation to expand the phylogenetic and geographic diversity of available axenic cultures. We also provide a new model of the DTE approach that uses cultivation results and natural abundance information to predict taxon-specific viability and iteratively constrain DTE experimental design to improve cultivation success.","NA"

Here, using CRISPR Cas9 genome-wide mutagenesis to screen for genetic determinants of 2-OG levels, we uncover a redox sensitive mitochondrial lipoylation pathway, dependent on the mitochondrial hydrolase ABHD11, that signals changes in mitochondrial 2-OG metabolism to 2-OG DD function. ABHD11 loss or inhibition drives a rapid increase in 2-OG levels by impairing lipoylation of the 2-OG dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc) - the rate limiting step for mitochondrial 2-OG metabolism. Rather than facilitating lipoate conjugation, ABHD11 protects the catalytic lipoyl domain from lipid peroxidation products formed by oxidative damage, demonstrating a requirement for a lipoyl repair pathway in human cells, and highlighting how the redox sensitivity of lipoylation modulates 2-OG metabolism.","NA"

This necessitates a dynamic lifespan perspective in which brain aberrations are inferred from deviations from expected lifespan trajectories. We applied machine learning to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indices of white matter structure and organization to estimate and compare brain age between patients with SZ, BD, and healthy controls across 10 cohorts.

MethodsWe trained six cross-validated models using different combinations of DTI data from 927 healthy controls (HC, 18-94 years), and applied the models to the test sets including 648 SZ (18-66 years) patients, 185 BD patients (18-64 years), and 990 HC (17-68 years), estimating brain age for each participant. Group differences were assessed using linear models, accounting for age, sex, and scanner. A meta-analytic framework was applied to assess the heterogeneity and generalizability of the results.

Results10-fold cross-validation revealed high accuracy for all models. Compared to controls, the model including all feature sets significantly over-estimated the age of patients with SZ (d=-.29) and BD (d=.18), with similar effects for the other models. The meta-analysis converged on the same findings. Fractional anisotropy (FA) based models showed larger group differences than the models based on other DTI-derived metrics.

ConclusionsBrain age prediction based on DTI provides informative and robust proxies for brain white matter integrity. Our results further suggest that white matter aberrations in SZ and BD primarily consist of anatomically distributed deviations from expected lifespan trajectories that generalize across cohorts and scanners.","NA"

The fumarate hydratase (FH) deficient subtype is found in up to 1.6% and can occur in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome.

We sequenced 13 FH deficient ULs from a previous immunohistochemical screen using a targeted panel and identified biallelic FH variants in all. In eight, we found a FH point mutation (two truncating, six missense) with evidence for loss of the second allele. Variant allele-frequencies in all cases with a point mutation pointed to somatic variants. Spatial clustering of the identified missense variants in the lyase domain indicated altered fumarase oligomerization with subsequent degradation as explanation for the observed FH deficiency. Biallelic FH deletions in five tumors confirm the importance of copy number loss as mutational mechanism.

By curating all pathogenic FH variants and calculating their population frequency, we estimate a carrier frequency of up to 1/2,563. Comparing with the prevalence of FH deficient ULs, we conclude that most are sporadic and estimate 2.7 - 13.9% of females with an FH deficient UL to carry a germline FH variant.

Further prospective tumor/normal sequencing studies are needed to develop a reliable screening strategy for HLRCC in women with ULs.","NA"

We show that KRAS-mutant tumor cells exclusively respond to KRAS blockade in vivo, because the oncogene co-opts host myeloid cells via a C-C-motif chemokine ligand 2/interleukin-1{beta} signaling loop for sustained tumorigenicity. Indeed, KRAS-mutant tumors did not respond to deltarasin in Ccr2 and Il1b gene-deficient mice, but were deltarasin-sensitive in wild-type and Ccr2-deficient mice adoptively transplanted with wild-type murine bone marrow. A KRAS-dependent pro-inflammatory transcriptome was prominent in human cancers with high KRAS mutation prevalence and predicted poor survival. Hence the findings support that in vitro systems are suboptimal for anti-KRAS drug screens, and suggest that interleukin-1{beta} blockade might be specific for KRAS-mutant cancers.","NA"

Despite years of research, important aspects of this process such as the number of gp41 trimers involved and how they orchestrate the rearrangement of the lipids in the apposed membranes along the fusion pathway remain obscure. To elucidate these molecular underpinnings, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of HIV-1 virions pinned to the CD4 T cell membrane by different numbers of gp41 trimers. We built realistic cell and viral membranes by mimicking their respective lipid compositions. We found that a single gp41 was inadequate for mediating fusion. Lipid mixing between membranes, indicating the onset of fusion, was efficient when 3 or more gp41 trimers pinned the membranes. The gp41 trimers interacted strongly with many different lipids in the host cell membrane, triggering lipid configurational rearrangements, exchange, and mixing. Simpler membranes, comprising fewer lipid types, displayed strong resistance to fusion, revealing the crucial role of the lipidomes in HIV-1 entry. Performing simulations at different temperatures, we estimated the free energy barrier to lipid mixing, and hence membrane stalk formation, with 4 tethering gp41 trimers to be [~]6.2 kcal/mol, a >4-fold reduction over estimates without gp41. Together, these findings present molecular-level, quantitative insights into the early stages of gp41-mediated HIV-1 entry.

By incorporating deuterated glucose into the cell culture medium during induction it was possible to distinguish whether or not downstream metabolites, either in lipid droplets or in the cytoplasm, had been formed before or after the adipogenic cascade, because C-D stretching bands are 1/{surd}2 shifted compared to the C-H bands. Thus, metabolites formed after the initiation of the process displayed both C-H and C-D stretching bands and so were forming during induced adipogenesis rather than prior to it. With the ability to distinguish small putative lipid drops formed by the induction of adipogenesis from those pre-formed in the cell, it was possible to analyze spectral changes occurring in the droplets at the earliest stages of adipogenesis. There were two key findings. Firstly, Raman spectra of lipid droplets evolved over time, suggesting that their composition at the early stages was not the same as at the later stages. Secondly, it was apparent that the proportion of unsaturated fats in droplets was higher at early stages than it was at later stages, suggesting that unsaturated fats arrive in the droplets faster than saturated ones.","NA"

Here we study the role of the epithelial-specific protein EpCAM, a contractility modulator, in cell shape and motility, and we show that it is required for the maturation of stress fibers and front-rear polarity acquisition at the single cell level. There, EpCAM ensures the remodeling of a transient active RhoA zone in the cortex of spreading epithelial cells. GTP-RhoA follows the endosomal pathway mediated by Rab35 and EHD1, where it co-evolves together with EpCAM. In fact, EpCAM balances GTP-RhoA turnover in order to tune actomyosin remodeling for cell shape, polarity and mechanical property acquisition. Impairment of GTP-RhoA endosomal trafficking either by EpCAM silencing or Rab35 / EHD1 mutant expression prevents correct myosin-II activity, stress fiber formation, and ultimately cell polarization.

The origin and emergence of its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, in the human population remains mysterious, although bat and pangolin were proposed to be the natural reservoirs. Strikingly, comparing to the SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs identified in bats and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 harbors a polybasic furin cleavage site in its spike (S) glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as its receptor to infect cells. Receptor recognition by the S protein is the major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. In an effort to search for the potential intermediate or amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, we examined receptor activity of ACE2 from 14 mammal species and found that ACE2 from multiple species can support the infectious entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the wild-type or furin cleavage site deficient S protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 of human/rhesus monkey and rat/mouse exhibited the highest and lowest receptor activity, respectively. Among the remaining species, ACE2 from rabbit and pangolin strongly bound to the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and efficiently supported the pseudotyped virus infection. These findings have important implications for understanding potential natural reservoirs, zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, and use of animal models.","NA"

Currently there is no proven treatment for COVID-19 and there is an urgent need for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Coronavirus spike glycoproteins play a critical role in coronavirus entry into the host cells, as they provide host cell recognition and membrane fusion between virus and host cell. Thus, they emerged as popular and promising drug targets. Crystal structures of spike protein in its closed and open states were resolved very recently in March 2020. These structures comprise 77% of the sequence and provide almost the complete protein structure. Based on down and up positions of receptor binding domain (RBD), spike protein can be in a receptor inaccessible closed or receptor accessible open state, respectively. Starting from closed and open state crystal structures, and also 16 intermediate conformations, an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the presence of explicit water and ions were performed. Simulations show that in its down position, RBD has significantly lower mobility compared to its up position; probably caused by the 6 interdomain salt bridges of RBD in down position compared to 3 in up position. Free energy landscapes based on MD simulations revealed a semi-open state located between closed and open states. Minimum energy pathway between down and up positions comprised a gradual salt bridge switching mechanism. Furthermore, although significantly lower than open state, ACE2 binding surface of RBD contained a partial solvent accessibility in its closed state.","NA"

I start from the fact that individuals require energy, trace molecules, water, and mates to survive and reproduce, and that phenotypic resource accrual traits determine an individual's ability to detect and acquire these resources. Optimum resource accrual traits, and their values, are determined by the dynamics of resources, aspects of the environment that hinder resource detection and acquisition by imposing risks of mortality and reproductive failure, and the energetic costs of developing and maintaining the traits -- part of an individual's energy budget. These budgets also describe how individuals utilize energy by partitioning it into maintenance, development and/or reproduction at each age and size, age and size at sexual maturity, and the size and number of offspring produced at each reproductive event. The optimum energy budget is consequently determined by the optimum life history strategy that describes how resources are utilized to maximize fitness by trading off investments in maintenance, development, and reproductive output at each age and size. The optimum life history in turn determines body size. An eco-evolutionary feedback loop occurs when resource accrual traits evolve to impact the quality and quantity of resources that individuals accrue, resulting in a new optimum life history strategy and energy budget required to deliver it, a change in body size, and altered population dynamics that, in turn, impact the resource base. These feedback loops can be complex, but can be studied by examining the eco-evolutionary journey of communities from one equilibrium state to another following a perturbation to the environment.","NA"

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rsfMRI) work has revealed changes in static connectivity related to age, sex, cognitive abilities and psychiatric symptoms, yet little is known how these factors may alter the information flow. The commonly used approach infers functional brain connectivity using stationary coefficients yielding static estimates of the undirected connection strength between brain regions. Dynamic graphical models (DGMs) are a multivariate model with dynamic coefficients reflecting directed temporal associations between nodes, and can yield novel insight into directed functional connectivity. Here, we leveraged this approach to test for associations between edge-wise estimates of direction flow across the brain connectome and age, sex, intellectual abilities and mental health. Methods: We applied DGM to investigate patterns of information flow in data from 984 individuals from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 10,249 individuals from the UK Biobank. Results: Our analysis yielded patterns of directed connectivity in independent HCP and UK Biobank data similar to those previously reported, including that the cerebellum consistently receives information from other networks. We show robust associations between information flow and age and sex for several connections, with strongest effects of age observed in the sensorimotor network.

RNA architecture is shaped by its secondary structure composed of stems, stacked canonical base pairs, enclosing loops. While stems are captured by free-energy models, loops composed of non-canonical base pairs are not. Nor are distant interactions linking together those secondary structure elements (SSEs). Databases of conserved 3D geometries (a.k.a. modules) not captured by energetic models are leveraged for structure prediction and design, but the computational complexity has limited their study to local elements, loops, and recently to those covering pairs of SSEs. Systematically capturing recurrent patterns on a large scale is a main challenge in the study of RNA structures. RESULTS: In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to compute maximal isomorphisms in edge colored graphs. This framework is well suited to RNA structures and allows us to generalize previous approaches. In particular, we apply our techniques to find for the first time modules spanning more than 2 SSEs, while improving speed a hundredfold. We extract all recurrent base pair networks among all non-redundant RNA tertiary structures and identify a module connecting 36 different SSEs common to the 23S ribosome of E.

We organize this information as a hierarchy of modules sharing similarities in their structure, which can serve as a basis for future research on the emergence of structural patterns.

Conversely, host cells may respond by altering their own mechanical behavior to limit infection. We have monitored epithelial cell monolayers sparsely infected with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes over the course of several days. As the bacteria replicate and spread from cell to cell, the infected host cells become softer and exert less traction on their extracellular matrix. Uninfected cells surrounding the infection focus become stiffer and actively move toward the site of infection, collectively squeezing the infected cells up into an extruding mound at late times post-infection. Bacteria in mounds are less able to spread laterally in the monolayer, limiting the growth of the focus, while mounded cells eventually undergo death. The cellular competition between infected and uninfected cells leading to mound formation is driven by active directional migration in surrounding uninfected cells, intact cell-cell junctions and innate immune signaling. Our results underline the dynamic remodeling capability of epithelial tissue and propose a general cooperative epithelial extrusion mechanism that could help to limit the local spread of infection.","NA"

We provide evidence that differences in the auxin pathway, a hormone signaling pathway required for plant growth and development, has led to the repeated evolution of erect and prostrate forms to contrasting coastal environments. Using multiple hybrid and natural populations, we show that adjacent erect and prostrate populations have repeatedly diverged in auxin-related genes and auxin-dependent phenotypes, such as gravitropism. Analysis of an advanced hybrid population in a multi-year field selection experiment revealed that high fitness families produce offspring with the local gravitropic response. We found that two auxin-related genes explained 45% of the variation in gravitropism in hybrid individuals. Remarkably, crossing hybrid individuals with extreme differences in gravitropism significantly reduces their ability to produce seed, showing gravitropism is genetically correlated with intrinsic reproductive isolation. Together, our results suggest that divergence in hormonal pathways can drive rapid adaptation to contrasting environments and to the origin of new species.","NA"

The viral infection may also represent an existential threat to our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates, many of which have already been reduced to small and endangered populations. The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species. While infection studies have shown that rhesus macaques exposed to the virus develop COVID-19-like symptoms, the susceptibility of other nonhuman primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, and all African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit the same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at significant contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences should greatly reduce the binding affinity of the ACE2 for the virus, hence moderating their susceptibility for infection. Other lemurs are predicted to be closer to catarrhines in their susceptibility. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys, as well as some lemurs are all likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, representing a critical threat to their survival.

To date, there are no known therapeutic or preventative agents to target CoVs. Though age and comorbidities severely increase case fatality rates, the host factors that influence resistance or susceptibility to infection with highly pathogenic human CoVs are unknown. Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded (ds) RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication. Here we show that COVID-19 patient samples of SARS-CoV-2 conserve the invariant sequence of the CoV macrodomain, an ADP-ribosylhydrolase domain previously shown to counteract innate immunity to both mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model CoV, and SARS-CoV. RNA sequence analysis of cell lines, infected ferrets, and a deceased patients lung shows that a set of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family members are induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection; these PARPs include enzymes required for the innate immune response to MHV. Further, we show that MHV infection induces an attack on host cell nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). The data indicate that overexpression of a virally induced PARP, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host cell NAD metabolism and that NAD+ boosting strategies differ in their efficacy to restore PARP10 function.

TEs are prevented from causing damage to the host genome by defense mechanisms such as nuclear silencing, where TE transcripts are targeted for degradation in an RNAi-like fashion. These pathways are well characterised in model organisms but very little is known about them in other species. Parasitic flatworms present an opportunity to investigate evolutionary novelties in TE control because they lack canonical pathways identified in model organisms (such as the piRNA pathways) but have conserved central players such as Dicer and Ago (argonaute) enzymes. Notably, parasitic flatworm Agos are phylogenetically distinct from classical Agos, raising the question of whether they play special roles in these organisms. In this report, we investigate the role of Ago proteins in the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. We show that transcript abundance of two retrotransposable elements increases upon silencing of S.mansoni Ago genes. We further demonstrate that SmAgo2 protein is primarily localised in the germ line of adult worms and its sub-cellular localisation is both nuclear and cytoplasmic.

During synchronous release, multiple vesicles can fuse at a single active zone; this multivesicular release is augmented by increasing extracellular calcium. Fusions during synchronous release are distributed throughout the active zone, whereas fusions during asynchronous release are biased toward the center of the active zone. Immediately after stimulation, the total number of docked vesicles across all synapses decreases by ~40%. Between 8 and 14 ms, new vesicles are recruited to the plasma membrane and fully replenish the docked pool in a calcium-dependent manner, but docking of these vesicles is transient and they either undock or fuse within 100 ms.

In the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, we examined the material factors and mechanical processes that determine the shape of epithelial cells. Since all cells are deposited on a basement membrane which influences the mechanics intracellularly, we reexamined the properties of this structure with fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. We found regions in which the basement membrane is much thicker than previously reported. We propose that these thickness patterns determine the height and basal surface area of cells and the curvature of the folds in the wing disc. Further, we examined the effect on cell shape and tissue mechanics when disruptions were instigated, at three different time scales: short (seconds, with laser cutting), medium (minutes, with drug treatments) and long (days, with RNAi interference). Disrupting the actin cytoskeleton through drug treatment affects cell shape only at the apical surface while the shapes in the medial plane and at the basal surface were not altered. In contrast, when integrin function was disrupted via RNAi or basement membrane integrity was abolished by drug treatment, medial and basal cell shapes were affected. Based on these findings and previous studies we propose a model of how cell shapes and tissue properties are determined with highly local and modular apical and basal mechanics.

Single-cell expression analysis of over 31,000 cells within the sarcoma shows that acute Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition shifts the immune composition of the tumor microenvironment, leading to selective transcriptional reprogramming of metabolic processes in specific immune cells thus acting both through tumor cell autonomous and non-autonomous (e.g. macrophage) cells.

Data, however, show that most of the known plasmids are non-transmissible. How are they maintained? Plasmid carriage costs are measured in competition assays between two microbes, with and without plasmid, where the cost is given by relative differences in growth rate. Here I report that plasmids change more traits than growth rate, and for some traits carrying plasmids can be beneficial. The growth dynamics of two constructs of Escherichia coli revealed that lag and yield are also sensitive to plasmid carriage. One of the constructs (R) bears a non-transmissible plasmid with a tetracycline-resistance gene. Its growth rate was, indeed, slower than its sensitive counterparts (S). But, crucially, it also attained higher yields. Since competition studies seek differences in growth rate only, the sensitivity of yield to plasmid carriage introduced unforeseen benefits: R-cells persisted alongside S in competition assays that favoured yield--without using tetracycline--for more than 80 generations. Importantly, determining the boundaries of  mutant selection windows follows identical rationale. Favouring yield meant R-cells were selected below the minimal selective concentration, suggesting that resistant mutants are selected with less exposure than previously thought. Thus, metrics that rely exclusively on growth rate, particularly density-independent growth rate such as fitness, may lead to unreliable predictions.","NA"

The glycosite occupancy by different glycoforms exhibited remarkable heterogeneity in human cell-expressed protein subunits, including up to 157 N-glycans, mainly of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, primarily of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.","NA"

The mechanisms of resistance to a particular stress are specialized and costly, then, mechanisms of resistance to other stresses can be negatively affected. However, it is also possible that at least a part of the stress resistance mechanisms is generic. With this premise we aimed to understand whether increased resistance to a cold stress can increase resistance to other types of stresses. To address this issue, we used populations of Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) that have been selected for 57-71 generations for increased resistance to cold shock (-5oC for one hour). We subjected the selected (FSB; selected for cold shock resistance, derived from BRB population) and control FCB; cold shock control, derived from BRB population) populations to a variety of environmental stresses such as cold shock, heat shock, starvation, desiccation and bacterial infection. We found that the compared to FCB populations, FSB populations had higher resistance to heat stress in terms of adult survivorship and mating ability post cold or heat shock. Desiccation resistance was observed higher in FSB females compared to FCB females but no such difference was found in males. We observed that FSB populations had lower starvation resistance relative to FCB populations. There was no difference between FSB and FCB populations in their ability to survive post bacterial infection. Our findings suggest that resistance to heat stress and desiccation (in females) are positively correlated with increased resistance to cold shock. However, resistance to starvation was negatively correlated with increased resistance to cold shock.","NA"

One source of this phenotypic heterogeneity is modifier genes that affect penetrance, dominance or expressivity of a primary pathogenic variant. Mouse models of epilepsy also display varying degrees of clinical severity on different genetic backgrounds. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) model Dravet syndrome, a severe epilepsy most often caused by SCN1A haploinsufficiency. Scn1a+/- heterozygous mice recapitulate key features of Dravet syndrome, including febrile and afebrile spontaneous seizures, SUDEP, and cognitive and behavioral deficits. The Scn1a+/- mouse model also exhibits strain-dependent phenotype severity. Scn1a+/- mice maintained on the 129S6/SvEvTac (129) strain have normal lifespan and no overt seizures. In contrast, admixture with C57BL/6J (B6) results in severe epilepsy and premature lethality in [B6x129]F1.Scn1a+/- mice. In previous work, we identified Dravet Survival Modifier loci (Dsm1-Dsm5) responsible for strain-dependent differences in survival. Gabra2, encoding the GABAA 2 subunit, was nominated as the top candidate modifier at the Dsm1 locus on chromosome 5. Direct measurement of GABAA receptors found lower abundance of 2-containing receptors in hippocampal synapses of B6 mice relative to 129. We also identified a B6-specific single nucleotide intronic deletion within Gabra2 that lowers mRNA and protein by nearly 50%. Repair of this de novo deletion reestablished normal levels of Gabra2 transcript and protein expression. In the current study, we used B6 mice with the repaired Gabra2 allele to validate it as a modifier of phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Repair of Gabra2 restored transcript and protein expression, increased abundance of 2-containing GABAA receptors in hippocampal synapses, and improved seizure and survival phenotypes of Scn1a+/- mice.

Yet, knowledge of the specific immune cell subsets targeted by IL-1{beta} and IL-1{beta}-induced signaling pathways in humans is limited. Utilizing mass cytometry (CyTOF) of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we identified effector memory CD4 T cells and CD4-CD8low/-CD161+ T cells as the circulating immune subtypes with the greatest expression of p-NF-{kappa}B in response to IL-1{beta} stimulation. Notably, CCR6 distinctly identified T cells most responsive to IL-1{beta}. Other subsets including CD11c myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), classical monocytes (CM), two subsets of natural killer cells (CD16-CD56brightCD161- and CD16-CD56dimCD161+) and a population of lineage- (Lin-) cells expressing CD161 and CD25 also showed IL-1{beta}-induced expression of p-NF-{kappa}B. The IL-1R antagonist, Anakinra significantly inhibited IL-1{beta}-induced p-NF-{kappa}B in the CCR6+ T cells and CD11c mDCs with a trending inhibition in CD14 monocytes and Lin-CD161+CD25+ cells. IL-1{beta} also induced a rapid but much less robust increase in p-p38 expression as compared to p-NF-{kappa}B in the majority of these same immune cell subsets. Prolonged IL-1{beta} stimulation greatly increased p-STAT3 and to a much lesser extent p-STAT1 and p-STAT5 in T cell subsets, monocytes, DCs and the Lin-CD161+CD25+ cells suggesting IL-1{beta}-induced production of downstream STAT-activating cytokines, consistent with its role in cytokine storm. Interindividual heterogeneity and inhibition of this activation by Anakinra raises the intriguing possibility that assays to measure IL-1{beta}-induced p-NF-{kappa}B in CCR6+ T cell subtypes could identify those at higher risk of cytokine storm and those most likely to benefit from Anakinra therapy.","NA"

In order to more accurately identify fungi in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, it is necessary to use genomic information. The purpose of our pilot study is to identify the factors to be considered for the identification of pathogenic fungi using mycobiome analysis in FFPE tissues. Methods: We selected 49 cases in five hospitals. In each case, FFPE tissue was cut into 50 um and DNA was extracted. Multiplex PCR with four primers (ITS1, ITS2, ITS3 and ITS4) was performed. Multiplex sequencing was performed using MinION device according to the manufacturer protocol. Sequences of each case were searched using BLASTN with an ITS database from NCBI RefSeq Targeted Loci Project with default parameter. Results: A total of 2,526 DNA nucleotides were sequenced. We were able to identify 342 fungal nucleotides in 24 (49.0%, 24/49) cases. The median value of the detected fungal DNA per case was 3 (1Q: 1 and 3Q: 14.25). The 215 (62.87%) fungal DNA contained the entire region of ITS1 or ITS2. The remaining 127 fungal DNAs were identified as fungi using partial sequence of ITS1, ITS2, 5.8S, LSU or SSU. Conclusion: In conclusion, we have identified the possibility of finding pathogenic fungi through mycobiome analysis in fungal infected FFPE tissues using nanopore sequencing method. However, we have also found several limitations to be solved for further studies. If we develop a method to characterize pathogenic fungi in FFPE tissues in a follow-up study, we think it will help patients to use appropriate antifungal agents.","NA"

As an essential gene, complete expression loss of pre-mRNA processing factor 4 kinase (PRP4K, also known as PRPF4B) is lethal. However, we demonstrate here that reduction of PRP4K levels by small interfering RNA in the mammary epithelial cell lines HMLE and MCF10A can induce partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marked by the retention of epithelial markers such as Zo-1 and E-cadherin, and upregulation of mesenchymal markers such as fibronectin and Zeb1. This partial EMT phenotype in non-transformed PRP4K-depleted cells is associated with greater invasive potential in 3D transwell assays, but either reduces or has no effect on 2D migration examined by scratch assay. This is in contrast to depletion of PRP4K in transformed triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which results in enhanced migration in 2D and invasion in 3D. Induction of EMT, using EMT-inducing media containing WNT-5a and TGF-{beta}1 or depletion of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3e (eIF3e) by shRNA, results in marked reduction of PRP4K expression. EMT induced by eIF3e depletion does not affect the transcription of PRP4K mRNA or turn-over of PRP4K protein, but rather reduces its protein translation. Finally, reduced PRP4K levels after eIF3e depletion correlated with increased YAP activity and nuclear localization, the latter being reversed by overexpression of exogenous PRP4K. Together, these data indicate that PRP4K is a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor negatively regulated by EMT, and that when depleted can induce partial EMT and increased cell invasion.","NA"

In biochemical studies, the forward reaction is studied at neutral pH, while the reverse reaction is typically characterized in more acidic buffers. This led us to question whether IDH1 catalysis is pH-regulated, which would have functional implications under conditions that alter cellular pH, like apoptosis, hypoxia, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show evidence of catalytic regulation of IDH1 by pH, identifying a trend of increasing kcat values for -KG production upon increasing pH in the buffers we tested. To understand the molecular determinants of IDH1 pH sensitivity, we used the pHinder algorithm to identify buried ionizable residues predicted to have shifted pKa values. Such residues can serve as pH sensors, with changes in protonation states leading to conformational changes that regulate catalysis. We identified an acidic residue buried at the IDH1 dimer interface, D273, with a predicted pKa value upshifted into the physiological range. D273 point mutations had decreased catalytic efficiency and, importantly, loss of pH-regulated catalysis. Based on these findings, we conclude that IDH1 activity is regulated, at least in part, by pH. We show this regulation is mediated by at least one buried acidic residue ~12 [A] from the IDH1 active site. By establishing mechanisms of regulation of this well-conserved enzyme, we highlight catalytic features that may be susceptible to pH changes caused by cell stress and disease.","NA"

However, in some organisms including the parasitic nematode Ascaris, programmed DNA elimination leads to a reduced somatic genome compared to germline cells. Previous work on the parasitic nematode Ascaris demonstrated that programmed DNA elimination encompasses high fidelity chromosomal breaks at specific genome locations and loss of specific genome sequences including a major tandem repeat of 120 bp and ~1,000 germline-expressed genes. However, the precise chromosomal locations of the 120 bp repeats, the breaks regions, and the eliminated genes remained unknown. Here, we used PacBio long-read sequencing and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) to obtain fully assembled chromosomes of Ascaris germline and somatic genomes, enabling a complete chromosomal view of DNA elimination. Surprisingly, we found that all 24 germline chromosomes undergo comprehensive chromosome end remodeling with DNA breaks in their subtelomeric regions and loss of distal sequences including the telomeres at both chromosome ends. All new Ascaris somatic chromosome ends are recapped by de novo telomere healing. We provide an ultrastructural analysis of DNA elimination and show that Ascaris eliminated DNA is incorporated into many double membrane-bound structures, similar to micronuclei, during telophase of a DNA elimination mitosis. These micronuclei undergo dynamic changes including loss of active histone marks and localize to the cytoplasm following daughter nuclei formation and cytokinesis where they form autophagosomes. Comparative analysis of nematode chromosomes suggests that germline chromosome fusions occurred forming Ascaris sex chromosomes that become independent chromosomes following DNA elimination breaks in somatic cells. These studies provide the first chromosomal view and define novel features and functions of metazoan programmed DNA elimination.","NA"

Studies have found that more and more proteins belong to multiple subcellular locations, and these proteins are called multi-label proteins. They not only play a key role in cell life activities, but also play an indispensable role in medicine and drug development. This article first presents a new prediction model, MpsLDA-ProSVM, to predict the SCL of multi-label proteins. Firstly, the physical and chemical information, evolution information, sequence information and annotation information of protein sequences are fused. Then, for the first time, use a weighted multi-label linear discriminant analysis framework based on entropy weight form (wMLDAe) to refine and purify features, reduce the difficulty of learning. Finally, input the optimal feature subset into the multi-label learning with label-specific features (LIFT) and multi-label k-nearest neighbor (ML-KNN) algorithms to obtain a synthetic ranking of relevant labels, and then use Prediction and Relevance Ordering based SVM (ProSVM) classifier to predict the SCLs. This method can rank and classify related tags at the same time, which greatly improves the efficiency of the model.

In mouse ESCs, SMO acts through a G-protein coupled mechanism that is independent of GLI activation. Our screen also identifies the Golgi proteins Tmed2 and Tmed10. We show that TMED2 binds SMO and controls its abundance at the plasma membrane. In neural differentiation and neural tube pattering Tmed2 acts as a repressor of HH signalling strength.

The nanopore sequencing process generates huge amounts of data in the form of raw current data, which must be compressed to enable efficient storage and transfer. Since the raw current data is inherently noisy, lossy compression has potential to significantly reduce space requirements without adversely impacting performance of downstream applications. Results: We study the impact of two state-of-the-art lossy time-series compressors applied to nanopore raw current data, evaluating the tradeoff between compressed size and basecalling/consensus accuracy. We test several basecallers and consensus tools on a variety of datasets at varying depths of coverage, and conclude that lossy compression can provide as much as 40-50% reduction in compressed size of raw signal data with negligible impact on basecalling and consensus accuracy.

We present here the revised full Dsx gene structure with an alternative exon one and two additional male NvDsx isoforms, which gives important insights into the evolution of the sex-specific oligomerization domains and C-termini. We show the sex-specific NvDsx expression throughout development, and demonstrate that transient NvDsx silencing in different male developmental stages dramatically shifts the morphology of two sexually dimorphic traits from male to female, with the effect being dependent on the timing of silencing. In addition, transient silencing of NvDsx in early male larvae affects male genitalia tissue growth but not morphology. This shows that male NvDsx is actively required to suppress female-specific traits and promote male-specific traits during specific developmental windows. These results also strongly suggests that in N. vitripennis most sex-specific tissues fully differentiate in the embryonic stage and only need NvDsx input for growth afterwards. This provides a first insight into the regulatory activity of Dsx in Hymenoptera and will help us to better understand the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms involved in sex-specific development, which can eventually lead to the development of new synthetic genetics-based tools for biological pest control by parasitoid wasps.","NA"

This listing can be attributed to climate change and its impact on ecosystems, and anthropomorphic environmental change due to extensive land clearing and habitat fragmentation. These have both been proven to induce stress, which influences the onset of disease. This novel study performed a retrospective analysis whereby records for 12,543 wild, rescued koalas in New South Wales (NSW), Australia were studied in order to determine trends in koala sightings, clinical admissions and injury diagnoses over a period of 29 years (1989-2018). Results indicated that between all three study locations (Port Stephens, Port Macquarie and Lismore), the most common reason koalas were admitted into care was because of disease, the most common disease diagnosed was signs of chlamydia, and the most common outcome for koalas admitted into care was released. At Port Stephens, mature and female koalas were diagnosed with a disease more than any other age or sex, while juvenile and male koalas were released (back into the wild) more than any other age or sex. Additionally, there were fewer koalas with a disease and fewer koalas released in Port Stephens as each year progressed. At Port Macquarie, mature and male koalas were diagnosed with a disease more than any other age or sex, while juvenile and female koalas were released more than any other age or sex. Additionally, there were more koalas with a disease and fewer koalas released in Port Macquarie as each year progressed. At Lismore, adult and female koalas were diagnosed with a disease more than any other age or sex, while joey and male koalas were released more than any other age or sex. Additionally, there were more koalas with a disease and fewer koalas released in Lismore as each year progressed. Determining trends in clinical admissions and diagnosis over such a substantial period of time is an important factor in preventing the continuing decline of koalas throughout Australia, and in particular NSW. It is important to note that there are cultural differences between koala rescue groups in the three study locations (Port Stephens, Port Macquarie and Lismore). These differences may be reflected in the outcomes of koala patients as each group are driven by their own management team. It is essential that any further decline of koala populations is prevented, however this can only be achieved through informed recommendations through research studies such as these. These recommendations should lead to government legislation which can provide stronger protection to koala habitat.","NA"

Several lines of evidence indicate the photosynthesis arose in the ancestors of cyanobacteria.

N-acetyl aspartate transferase 8 like (NAT8L) mRNA is one such transcript, whose translated product enzymatically synthesizes N-acetyl aspartic acid (NAA), a neuronal metabolite important for myelin synthesis.

We used an operant temporal production task, in which mice indicate their expected timing of available rewards by pressing a lever in anticipation. On probe trials, inactivation of the MD with muscimol produced rightward shifts in peak pressing as well as increases in peak spread, thus significantly altering both temporal accuracy and precision. Optogenetic inhibition of glutamatergic projection neurons in the MD resulted in similar changes in timing; the shift in peak time is proportional to the duration of inhibition.

To test this hypothesis, we correlated a reliable behavioral trait, the individual rate of forgetting in long-term memory, with a readily available task-free neuroimaging measure, the resting-state EEG spectrum. Using an established, adaptive fact-learning procedure, the rate of forgetting for verbal and visual materials was measured in a sample of 50 undergraduates from whom we also collected eyes-closed resting-state EEG data. A statistical analysis revealed that the individual rates of forgetting were significantly correlated across verbal and visual materials, in agreement previous results. Importantly, both rates correlated with power levels in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and low beta (13-15 Hz) frequency bands, with the correlation between verbal rate of forgetting and low beta power over the right parietal site being significant even when accounting for multiple comparisons.

Here, we examined the properties of cholinergic transmission at individual contacts made between direction-selective starburst amacrine cells and downstream ganglion cells in the retina. Using a combination of electrophysiology, serial block-face electron microscopy, and two-photon ACh imaging, we demonstrate that ACh signaling bears the hallmarks of both non-synaptic and synaptic forms of transmission.

Fast cholinergic signals do not appear to depend on anatomically well-defined synaptic structures. We estimate that ACh spread is limited to ~1-2 m from its sites of release, which may help starbursts drive local direction-selective cholinergic responses in ganglion cell dendrites. Together, our results establish the functional architecture for cholinergic signaling at a central synapse and propose a novel motif whereby single presynaptic sites can co-transmit information to multiple neurons on a millisecond timescale.","NA"

We focused on VIP neurons because they are known to receive strong long-range inputs and have a typical laminar bias towards upper layers. In reeler these neurons are more distributed across the cortex. We mapped the brain-wide inputs of VIP neurons in barrel cortex of wildtype and reeler mice with rabies virus tracing. Innervation by subcortical inputs was not altered in reeler, in contrast to the cortical circuitry.

Methods: In vivo corneal confocal microscopy images were collected from both male and female age-matched specific-pathogen free rhesus and pigtailed macaques housed at the Johns Hopkins University breeding colony using the Heidelberg HRTIII with Rostock Corneal Module. We also obtained repeat IVCM images of 12 SIV-infected animals including pre-infection and 10 day post-SIV infection time-points. All IVCM images were analyzed using a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture developed specifically for macaque studies. Results: Deep learning-based segmentation of subbasal nerves in IVCM images from macaques demonstrated that corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL) and fractal dimension measurements did not differ between species, but pigtailed macaques had significantly higher baseline corneal nerve fiber tortuosity than rhesus macaques (P = 0.005). Neither sex nor age of macaques was associated with differences in any of the assessed corneal subbasal nerve parameters. In the SIV/macaque model of HIV, acute SIV infection induced significant decreases in both corneal nerve fiber length and fractal dimension (P= 0.01 and P= 0.008 respectively). Conclusions: The combination of IVCM and objective, robust, and rapid deep-learning analysis serves as a powerful noninvasive research and clinical tool to track sensory nerve damage, enabling early detection of neuropathy.

We find that synchrony across cortex has a surprisingly large and systematic effect on predicted MEG spatial topography. We then conducted visual MEG experiments and separated responses into stimulus-locked and broadband components. The stimulus-locked topography was similar to model predictions assuming synchronous neural sources, whereas the broadband topography was similar to model predictions assuming asynchronous sources. We infer that visual stimulation elicits two distinct types of neural responses, one highly synchronous and one largely asynchronous across cortex.","NA"

Based on our experience with 251 women, many in their 40s, here we suggest that Endo-Gym method (for endocrine gymnastics), a combination of personalized physical exercises, fertility-optimizing diet and personal coaching, can significantly increase IVF success, probably by both reducing distress caused by repeated cycles and alleviating fertility-affecting problems, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and premature ovarian failure (POF).

Although the involvement of the jacalin domain-containing protein, OsSalT, has been reported in drought and salinity tolerance, its functional mechanism still remains largely unexplored. In this study, expression of the OsSalT gene was found to be positively correlated with the drought tolerance potential with its higher transcript abundance in the tolerant indica rice cultivar, Vandana and lower abundance in the susceptible cultivar, MTU1010. Moreover, the ectopic expression of OsSalT in tobacco imparted drought stress tolerance in the transgenic lines. The transgenic lines exhibited significantly improved growth and higher osmolyte accumulation over the wild-type (WT) plants together with the induction in the OsSalT expression under drought stress. Fascinatingly, the yeast two-hybrid and BiFC analyses confirmed the interaction of OsSalT protein with two interesting transcription factors (TFs), OsNAC1 and OsDREB2A. In silico analysis further revealed that the OsSalT protein interacted with the regulatory domain of OsDREB2A and the C-terminal domain of OsNAC1 leading to their activation and induction of their downstream drought-responsive genes.

Using siRNA-mediated gene knockdown we show that TRIP6 is required for LIMD1 localization to adherens junctions, whereas LIMD1 is not required for TRIP6 localization. TRIP6, but not LIMD1, is also required for recruitment of Vinculin and VASP to adherens junctions. Knockdown of TRIP6 or Vinculin, but not of LIMD1, also influences the localization of phosphorylated myosin light chain and F-actin. In TRIP6 knockdown cells actin stress fibers are lost apically but increased basally, and there is a corresponding increase in recruitment of Vinculin and VASP to basal focal adhesions. These observations identify a role for TRIP6 in organizing F-actin and maintaining tension at adherens junctions that could account for its influence on LIMD1 and LATS. They also suggest that focal adhesions and adherens junctions compete for key proteins needed to maintain attachments to contractile F-actin.","NA"

Munoz","Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","2020-04-20",1,"cc_no","new results","evolutionary biology","Animals show a rich diversity of signals and displays. Among the many selective forces driving the evolution of communication between individuals, one widely recognized factor is the structure of the environment in which signals are produced, transmitted and received. In particular, animals communicating by sounds often emit acoustic signals from specific locations, such as high up in the air, from the ground or in the water. The properties of these different display sites will impose different constraints on sound production and transmission and may therefore drive signal evolution. Here, we used comparative phylogenetic analyses to assess the relationship between the display site properties and the structure of reproductive calls from 161 frog species from the frog families Ranidae, Leptodactylidae and Hylidae. Specifically, we compared the dominant frequency of species that vocalize from aquatic versus non-aquatic sites, and its relation with body size. We found that the dominant frequency of frogs calling from the water was lower than that of species calling outside of the water, a trend that was consistent across the three families studied. Furthermore, phylogenetic path analysis revealed that the call site had both direct and indirect effects on the dominant frequency. Indirect effects were mediated by call site influencing male body size, which in turn was negatively associated to call dominant frequency. Our results suggest that properties of display sites can drive signal evolution, most likely through morphological constraints, in particular the ones imposed on the sound production mechanism. Also, variation in body size between calling sites explained some of the differences we found in call frequency, highlighting the relevance of the interplay between morphological adaptation and signal evolution. Changes of display site may therefore have important evolutionary consequences, as it may influence sexual selection processes and ultimately may even promote speciation.","NA"

To address this issue, we examined the spatial coding characteristics of hippocampal neurons in mice and rats navigating different environments. We found that CA1 place cells located in the superficial sublayer were more active in cue-poor environments, and preferentially used a firing rate code driven by intra-hippocampal inputs. In contrast, place cells located in the deep sublayer were more active in cue-rich environments and expressed a phase code driven by entorhinal inputs. Switching between these two spatial coding modes was supported by the interaction between excitatory gamma inputs and local inhibition.","NA"

Presumably, these cues are differentially weighted against prior assumptions on the properties of sound sources in the environment. The rules guiding this weighting process are not well understood.

The positive regulatory factor A (PrfA) is a key homodimeric transcription factor that modulates the transcription of multiple virulence factors which are ultimately responsible of Listeria monocytogenes pathogenicity. In the present manuscript we describe several new potential PrfA inhibitors that were identified after performing ligand-based virtual screening followed by structure-based virtual screening against the wild-type PrfA structure. The three top-scored drug-likeness inhibitors bound to the wild-type PrfA structure were further assessed by Molecular Dynamics simulations.

As one of the members of syndecans family, syndecan-4 is also an important mediator for tube formation. However, the effects of YKL-40 on migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) mediated by syndecan-4 receptor are unknown. Methods: HUVECs were transfected with lentivirus encoding syndecan-4 short hairpin (sh) RNA (lenti-synd4 shRNA) and the efficiency of transfection was measured using reverse transcription quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and flow cytometry. The effects of recombinant protein of YKL-40 on migration and angiogenesis of HUVECs adjusted by syndecan-4 were determined by wound healing and tube formation assay. The expression of protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in HUVECs was measured using western blotting. Results: Transfection of lenti-synd4 shRNA significantly decreased the membrane protein expression of syndecan-4 in HUVECs. HUVECs transfected with lenti-synd4 shRNA remarkably inhibited the migration and tube formation of endothelial cells stimulated by recombinant protein of YKL-40. The levels of PKC and ratio of p-ERK1/2 to ERK1/2 in HUVECs were also down-regulated by silencing syndecan-4. Conclusion: The effects of YKL-40-induced on migration and tube formation of HUVECs may partly be inhibited by knock-downing syndecan-4 through suppressing PKC and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.","NA"

Although mutations in TARDBP, encoding TDP-43, account for less than 1% of all ALS cases, TDP-43-positive aggregates are present in nearly all ALS patients, including patients with sporadic ALS (sALS) or carrying other familial ALS (fALS)-causing mutations. Interestingly, TDP-43 inclusions are also present in subsets of patients with frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease; therefore, methods of activating intracellular protein quality control machinery capable of clearing toxic cytoplasmic TDP-43 species may alleviate disease-related phenotypes. Here, we identify a novel function of Nemo-like kinase (Nlk) as a negative regulator of lysosome biogenesis. Genetic or pharmacological reduction of Nlk increased lysosome formation and improved clearance of aggregated TDP-43. Furthermore, Nlk reduction ameliorated pathological, behavioral, and lifespan deficits in two distinct mouse models of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Because many toxic proteins can be cleared along the autophagy-lysosome axis, targeted reduction of Nlk represents a viable approach to therapy development for multiple neurodegenerative disorders.","NA"

Although the rice lectin protein, Osr40c1, has been reported to be regulated by drought stress, the mechanism of its drought tolerance activity has not been studied so far. In this study, it has been depicted that expression of Osr40c1 gene correlates with the drought tolerance potential of various rice cultivars. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing Osr40c1 were significantly more tolerant to drought stress over the wild-type plants. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the Osr40c1 gene in tobacco yielded a similar result. Interestingly, the protein displayed a nucleo-cytoplasmic localization and was found to interact with a number of drought-responsive proteins like OsSAM2, OsSAP8, OsMNB1B, and OsH4. Fascinatingly, silencing of each of these protein partners led to drought susceptibility in the otherwise tolerant Osr40c1 expressing transgenic tobacco lines indicating that these partners were crucial for the Osr40c1-mediated drought tolerance in planta. Together, the present investigation delineated the novel role of Osr40c1 protein in imparting drought tolerance by regulating the chromatin proteins, OsMNB1B and OsH4, which presumably enables OsSAP8 to induce downstream gene expression. In addition, its interaction with OsSAM2 might induce polyamine biosynthesis thus further improving drought tolerance in plants.","NA"

However, methodological limitations impede attempts to catalogue targeted processes and infer systemic mechanisms of action. Integrative systems biology approaches are better suited in these cases due to their analytical comprehensiveness. Method: The transcriptome data from drug-treated breast cancer cell lines were mapped on human protein interactome to construct targeted subnetworks. The subnetworks were analysed in terms of enriched oncogenic signalling pathways by reducing redundancy through pathway-pathway interaction networks, and the filtered pathways were mapped on oncogenesis processes. Results: The signalling pathways regulated by the pleiotropic effects of Actein, Withaferin A, Indole-3-Carbinol and Compound Kushen were found to be projected on a set of oncogenesis processes at the transcriptomic level in different breast cancer subtypes (triple negative, luminal A and HER2+). Notably, these compounds indirectly regulated known oncogenes in the different subtypes through their associated pathways in the subnetworks. Conclusion: The proposed approach infers the mechanisms of action from enriched subnetworks and oncogenic signalling pathways and provides a systematic approach for evaluating poly-pharmacologic compounds.","NA"

Yet, the access to anthropogenic resources on primate biology, health, and fitness remain poorly studied. Given their ubiquity across a range of human impacted landscapes, from cities to national parks, savanna monkeys (Chlorocebus spp.) provide an excellent study system in which to test these effects. We compared body condition and reproductive maturation in vervets (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) inhabiting a private farm in !Gariep Dam, with ample access to anthropogenic foods, and wild-foraging vervets in Soetdoring Nature Reserve, South Africa. Overall, vervets in !Gariep show significantly thicker skin folds, and higher BMI and body mass, than those in Soetdoring, suggesting increased fat deposition. Males in !Gariep have larger relative testis volumes at peri-pubescent ages compared to those in Soetdoring, suggesting early reproductive maturation associated with age-specific increases in body mass. Females from !Gariep showed evidence of an earlier onset of reproduction than those in Soetdoring, based on parity status as assessed by nipple length and evidence of lactation. Parity status at sub-adult dental ages was also strongly associated with body mass. These results are consistent with a positive effect of anthropogenic food-enhancement on body fat deposition, potentially linked to an earlier onset of reproductive maturation. Further investigation into primate responses to cultivated resources will inform our understanding of the broader effects of food enhancement on developmental plasticity.","NA"

This likely contributes to limited translational impact. A major bottleneck for the adoption of socially complex, ethology-rich, preclinical procedures are the technical limitations for consistently annotating detailed behavioral repertoires of rodent social behavior. Manual annotation is subjective, prone to observer drift, and extremely time-intensive. Commercial approaches are expensive and inferior to manual annotation. Open-source alternatives often require significant investments in specialized hardware and significant computational and programming knowledge. By combining recent computational advances in convolutional neural networks and pose-estimation with further machine learning analysis, complex rodent social behavior is primed for inclusion under the umbrella of computational neuroethology. Here we present an open-source package with graphical interface and workflow (Simple Behavioral Analysis, SimBA) that uses pose-estimation to create supervised machine learning predictive classifiers of rodent social behavior, with millisecond resolution and accuracies that can out-perform human observers. SimBA does not require specialized video acquisition hardware nor extensive computational background. Standard descriptive statistical analysis, along with graphical region of interest annotation, are provided in addition to predictive classifier generation. To increase ease-of-use for behavioural neuroscientists, we designed SimBA with accessible menus for pre-processing videos, annotating behavioural training datasets, selecting advanced machine learning options, robust classifier validation functions and flexible visualizations tools. This allows for predictive classifier transparency, explainability and tunability prior to, and during, experimental use. We demonstrate that this approach is flexible and robust in both mice and rats by classifying social behaviors that are commonly central to the study of brain function and social motivation. Finally, we provide a library of pose-estimation weights and behavioral predictive classifiers for resident-intruder behaviors in mice and rats. All code and data, together with detailed tutorials and documentation, are available on the SimBA GitHub repository.","NA"

Besides its oligosaccharyltransferase activity, TfpW may be responsible for periplasmic translocation and polymerization of D-Araf. Here we investigated these potential roles of TfpW in Pa5196 pilin glycosylation. Topology studies confirmed the periplasmic location of loop 1 and the large C-terminus domain, however the central portion of TfpW had an indeterminate configuration. Reconstitution of the Pa5196 pilin glycosylation system by providing pilA, tfpW +/- tfpX and the D-Araf biosynthesis genes PsPA7_6246-6249 showed that TfpW is sufficient for glycan polymerization and transfer to pilins in P. aeruginosa PAO1, while TfpX is also necessary in Escherichia coli. In addition toPsPA7_6246, DprE1 (PsPA7_6248) and DprE2 (PsPA7_6249), the GtrA-like component PsPA7_6247 was required for pilin glycosylation in E. coli versus PAO1. In a PAO1 arnEF mutant, loss of PsPA7_6247 expression decreased the level of pilin glycosylation, suggesting that arnEF may play a role in pilin glycosylation when PsPA7_6247 is absent. Bacterial two-hybrid studies showed interactions of TfpW with itself, TfpX, PsPA7_6247 and DprE2, suggesting the formation of a complex that enables efficient pilin glycosylation. Fluorescence microscopy of E. coli and Pa5196 dprE1 expressing a DprE1-sGFP fusion showed that the protein is expressed in the cytoplasm, supporting our model that includes cytoplasmic biosynthesis of the lipid carrier-linked D-Araf precursor prior to its periplasmic translocation. Together these data suggest that TfpW may be the first example of a trifunctional flippase, glycosyltransferase, and oligosaccharyltransferase.","NA"

DNA metabarcoding can contribute to assessing diverse insect communities over a range of spatial and temporal scales, but efforts are still needed to optimise and standardise procedures, from field sampling, through laboratory analysis, to bioinformatic processing. Here we describe and test a methodological pipeline for surveying nocturnal flying insects, combining a customised automatic light trap and DNA metabarcoding. We optimised laboratory procedures and then tested the methodological pipeline using 12 field samples collected in northern Portugal in 2017. We focused on Lepidoptera to compare metabarcoding results with those from morphological identification, using three types of bulks produced from each sample (individuals, legs and the unsorted mixture). The customised trap was highly efficient at collecting nocturnal flying insects, allowing a small team to operate several traps per night, and a fast field processing of samples for subsequent metabarcoding with low contamination risks. Morphological processing yielded 871 identifiable individuals of 102 Lepidoptera species. Metabarcoding detected a total of 528 taxa, most of which were Lepidoptera (31.1%), Diptera (26.1%) and Coleoptera (14.7%). There was a reasonably high matching in community composition between morphology and metabarcoding when considering the 'individuals' and 'legs' bulk samples, with few errors mostly associated with morphological misidentification of small microlepidoptera. Regarding the 'mixture' bulk sample, metabarcoding identified nearly four times more Lepidoptera species than morphological examination. Our study provides a methodological metabarcoding pipeline that can be used in standardised surveys of nocturnal flying insects, showing that it can overcome limitations and potential shortcomings of traditional methods based on morphological identification. Our approach efficiently collects highly diverse taxonomic groups such as nocturnal Lepidoptera that are poorly represented when using Malaise traps and other widely used field methods. To enhance the potential of this pipeline in ecological studies, efforts are needed to test its effectiveness and potential biases across habitat types and to extend the DNA barcode databases for important groups such as Diptera.","NA"

We show that the eigenmodes of the Maury operator have a direct physical interpretation as the relaxation, or resistive, modes of the network. We apply these findings to both idealised and image-based models of ventilation in lung airway trees and show that the spectral properties of the Maury matrix characterise the flow asymmetry in these networks more concisely than the Laplacian modes, and that eigenvector centrality in the Maury spectrum is closely related to the phenomenon of ventilation heterogeneity caused by airway narrowing or obstruction.

GBPs target pathogen-containing vacuoles or the pathogen itself, and assist in membrane-disruption and release of microbial molecules that trigger cell death by activating the inflammasomes. We previously showed that GBP1 mediates atypical apoptosis or pyroptosis of human macrophages infected with Toxoplasma gondii (Tg) or Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (STm), respectively. In mice, the p47 Immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) control the recruitment of GBPs to microbe-containing vacuoles and subsequent cell death. However, humans are devoid of functional IRGs, and the pathogen-proximal immune detection mechanisms by GBP1 are poorly understood. Here, we describe two novel single-cell assays which show that GBP1 promotes the lysis of Tg-containing vacuoles and Tg plasma membrane, resulting in the cytosolic detection of Tg-DNA. In contrast, we show GBP1 only targets cytosolic STm and does not contribute to bacterial escape into the cytosol of human macrophages. GBP1 interacts with caspase-4 and recruits it directly to the bacterial surface, where caspase-4 can be activated by LPS. During STm infection, caspase-1 cleaves and inactivates GBP1 at Asp192, a site conserved in related mammalian GBP1 proteins but not in murine Gbps. STm-infected human macrophages expressing a cleavage-deficient GBP1 mutant exhibit higher pyroptosis due to the absence of caspase-1-mediated feedback inhibition of the GBP1-caspase-4 pathway.

Previous research identified predictors on a population level through linear models and clinical data, including conventional assessments describing impaired body functions, such as sensorimotor impairments. The objective of this work was to explore the feasibility of providing an individualized and more accurate prediction of rehabilitation outcomes in pwMS by leveraging non-linear machine learning models, clinical data, and digital health metrics characterizing sensorimotor impairments. Methods: Clinical data and digital health metrics of upper limb sensorimotor impairments were recorded from eleven pwMS undergoing neurorehabilitation. Machine learning models were trained on pre-intervention data that were structured in six feature sets (patient master data, intervention type, conventional assessments on body function or activity level, digital health metrics) and combinations thereof. The dependent variables indicated whether a considerable improvement on the activity level was observed across the intervention or not (binary classification), as defined by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block Test (BBT), or Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT). Models were evaluated in a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results: The presence of considerable improvements in ARAT and BBT could be accurately predicted (94% balanced accuracy) by only relying on patient master data (age, sex, MS type, and chronicity). The presence of considerable improvements in NHPT could be accurately predicted (89% balanced accuracy), but required knowledge about sensorimotor impairments. Assessing these with digital health metrics instead of conventional scales allowed to increase the balanced accuracy by up to +17%. Non-linear machine-learning models improved the predictive accuracy for the NHPT by +25% compared to linear models. Conclusions: This work demonstrates the feasibility of a personalized prediction of upper limb neurorehabilitation outcomes in pwMS using multi-modal data collected before neurorehabilitation and machine learning. Information about sensorimotor impairment was necessary to predict changes in dexterous hand control, where conventional tests of impaired body functions were outperformed by digital health metrics, thereby underlining their potential to provide a more sensitive and fine-grained assessment.

Recently, network-based methods for the analysis of drug-target interactions have gained attention and relies on the paradigm that a single drug can act on multiple targets rather than a single target. In this study, we have presented a novel approach to analyze the interactions between the chemicals in the medicinal plants and multiple targets based on the complex multipartite network of the medicinal plants, multi-chemicals, and multiple targets. The multipartite network was constructed via the conjunction of two relationships: chemicals in plants and the biological actions of those chemicals on the targets. By analyzing the structural characteristics of the network using the network analysis techniques, we investigated the similarities among the plants via their chemical profiles obtained from the hierarchical clustering analysis. In doing so, we introduced an index of the efficacy of chemicals in a plant on a protein target of interest, called target potency score (TPS). We showed that the analysis can identify specific chemical profiles from each group of plants, which can then be employed for discovering new alternative therapeutic agents. Furthermore, specific clusters of plants and chemicals acting on specific targets were retrieved using TPS that suggested potential drug candidates with high probability of clinical success. We expect that this approach may open a way to predict the biological functions of multi-chemicals and multi-plants on the targets of interest and enable repositioning of the plants and chemicals.","NA"

However, this is achieved at the cost of lengthy imaging times, limiting temporal resolution. In recent years, a variety of approaches have been suggested to reduce imaging times, ranging from classical optimization and statistical algorithms to deep learning methods. Classical methods often rely on prior knowledge of the optical system and require heuristic adjustment of parameters or do not lead to good enough performance. Deep learning methods proposed to date tend to suffer from poor generalization ability outside the specific distribution they were trained on, and require learning of many parameters. They also tend to lead to black-box solutions that are hard to interpret. In this paper, we suggest combining a recent high-performing classical method, SPARCOM, with model-based deep learning, using the algorithm unfolding approach which relies on an iterative algorithm to design a compact neural network considering domain knowledge. We show that the resulting network, Learned SPARCOM (LSPARCOM), requires far fewer layers and parameters, and can be trained on a single field of view. Nonetheless it yields comparable or superior results to those obtained by SPARCOM with no heuristic parameter determination or explicit knowledge of the point spread function, and is able to generalize better than standard deep learning techniques. It even allows producing a high-quality reconstruction from as few as 25 frames. This is due to a significantly smaller network, which also contributes to fast performance - 5x improvement in execution time relative to SPARCOM, and a full order of magnitudes improvement relative to a leading competing deep learning method (Deep-STORM) when implemented serially. Our results show that we can obtain super-resolution imaging from a small number of high emitter density frames without knowledge of the optical system and across different test sets. Thus, we believe LSPARCOM will find broad use in single molecule localization microscopy of biological structures, and pave the way to interpretable, efficient live-cell imaging in a broad range of settings.","NA"

Here we analyzed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses for the presence of a unique cis RNA element called SECReTE. This motif consists of 10 or more consecutive triplet nucleotide repeats where a pyrimidine nucleotide (C or U) in present every third base, and which we identified in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins in bacteria, yeast, and humans. This motif facilitates mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), along with the enhanced translation and secretion of translated protein. We now examined for SECReTE presence in Group IV and V RNA viruses, the former including the Coronaviridae, like SARS-CoV-2 and other positive (+)ssRNA viruses, and the latter consisting of negative (-) ssRNA viruses. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 40 SECReTE motifs at an abundance of ~1.3 SECReTEs/kilobase (kb). Moreover, all ssRNA viruses we examined contain multiple copies of this motif and appears in (+)ssRNA viruses as non-random in occurrence and independent of genome length. Importantly, (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviruses and Hepaciviruses), which utilize ER membranes to create double membrane vesicles to serve as viral replication centers (VRCs), contain more SECReTE motifs per kb as compared to (-)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Rabies, Mumps, and Influenza), that replicate in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, or other (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Enteroviruses and Flaviviruses) which employ different organellar membranes. As predicted by our earlier work, SECReTE sequences are mostly found in membranal or ER-associated/secreted proteins. Thus, we propose that SECReTE motifs could be important for the efficient translation and secretion of secreted viral proteins, as well as for VRC formation. Future studies of SECReTE function and identification of SECReTE-binding proteins could provide new drug targets to treat COVID-19 and other (+)ssRNA related diseases.","NA"

Modeling of plasmid transfer is essential to uncovering the fundamentals of resistance transfer and for development of predictive measures to limit the spread of resistance. However, a major limitation in the current understanding of plasmids is the inadequate characterization of the DNA transfer mechanisms, which conceals the actual potential for plasmid transfer in nature. Here, we consider that the plasmid-borne origin-of-transfer substrates encode specific DNA structural properties that can facilitate finding these regions in large datasets, and develop a DNA structure-based alignment procedure for typing the transfer substrates. Since our method outperforms current sequence-based approaches, we identify thousands of yet undiscovered DNA transfer substrates, showing that plasmid mobility is in fact 2-fold higher and spans almost 2-fold more host species than is currently known. Over half of all mobile plasmids contain the means to transfer between different mobility groups, which links previously confined host ranges across ecological habitats into a vast network of potential plasmid transfers. Certain types of conjugative transfer mechanisms and their corresponding hosts are transfer hubs that help break down the horizontal gene transfer barriers and form a robust gene flow system. We show that this network in fact serves to transfer resistance from the environmental genetic reservoirs to human MDR pathogens, which is an important driver of the observed rapid resistance development in humans and thus an important point of focus for future prevention measures.","NA"

While the polyQ domain is important for fibril formation, the dynamic, C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) of HTTex1 makes up a large fraction of the fibril surface. Because potential fibril toxicity has to be mediated by interactions of the fibril surface with its cellular environment, we wanted to model the conformational space adopted by the PRD. We ran 800 ns long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the PRD using an explicit water model optimized for intrinsically disordered proteins. These simulations accurately predicted our previous solid state NMR data and newly acquired EPR DEER distances, lending confidence in their accuracy. The simulations show that the PRD generally forms an imperfect polyproline II (PPII) helical conformation. The two polyproline (polyP) regions within the PRD stay in a PPII helix for most of the simulation, whereas occasional kinks in the proline rich linker region cause an overall bend in the PRD structure.

Our study points at CTBP2 as a co-activator of SREBP genes whose complex activity is impaired by ZBTB18. ZBTB18 binding to the SREBP gene promoters is associated with reduced LSD1 activity leading to increased di-methylation of lysine 9 (H3K9me2), and concomitant decrease of H3K4me3 with consequent repression of the SREBP genes.

To unravel the consequences of a TP53 promoter relocated in this manner, we performed in-depth genetic analyses of osteosarcoma biopsies (n=148) and cell models. We show that TP53 structural variations not only facilitate further chromosomal alterations, but also allow the constitutively active TP53 promoter to upregulate putative oncogenes erroneously placed under its control. Paradoxically, many of the induced genes are part of the TP53-associated transcriptome, suggesting a need to counterbalance the initial loss of function.

Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Hh co-receptors Gas1 and Cdon may be used as therapeutic targets to modulate Dhh signaling in ECs. Methods and results: We demonstrated that both Gas1 and Cdon are expressed in adult ECs and relied on either siRNAs or EC specific conditional KO mice to investigate their role. We found that Gas1 deficiency mainly photocopies Dhh deficiency especially by inducing VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 overexpression while Cdon deficiency has opposite effects by promoting endothelial junction integrity. At a molecular level, Cdon prevents Dhh binding to Ptch1 and thus acts a decoy receptor for Dhh, while Gas1 promotes Dhh binding to Smo and as a result potentiates Dhh effects. Since Cdon is overexpressed in ECs treated by inflammatory cytokines including TNF and Il1{beta}, we then tested whether Cdon inhibition would promote endothelium integrity in acute inflammatory conditions and found that both fibrinogen and IgG extravasation were decreased in association with an increased Cdh5 expression in the brain cortex of EC specific Cdon KO mice administered locally with Il1{beta}. Conclusion: Altogether these results demonstrate that Gas1 is a positive regulator of Dhh in ECs while Cdon is a negative regulator. Interestingly Cdon blocking molecules may then be used to promote endothelium integrity at least in inflammatory conditions.","NA"

Although the exact visual cues individuals use to coordinate their movements with neighbors have not yet been decoded, some studies have suggested that stripes, lines or other body patterns may act as conspicuous conveyors of movement information that could promote coordinated group movement, or promote dazzle camouflage, thereby confusing predators. We used phylogenetic logistic regressions to test whether the contrasting achromatic body patterns of four different taxa vulnerable to predation, including species within two orders of birds (Anseriformes and Charadriiformes), a suborder of Artiodactyla (the ruminants) and several orders of marine fish (predominantly Perciformes) were associated with group living. Contrasting body patterns were significantly more prevalent in social species, and tended to be absent in solitary species or species less vulnerable to predation. We suggest that body patterns taking the form of white lines on dark backgrounds, or vice versa, provide a widespread mechanism across taxa that serves either to inform conspecifics of neighbors' directional movement, or to confuse predators, when moving in groups. Detection and processing of patterns and of motion in the visual channel is essentially colourblind. That diverse animal taxa with widely different vision systems (including di-, tri- and tetrachromats) appear to have converged on a similar use of achromatic patterns is therefore expected given signal-detection theory.

These results suggest that the two distinct coevolutionary mechanisms are likely to be major drivers of far greater genetic divergence between animals and plants, and open a new door to understanding the roles of promoters and TFs in tumor initiation and progression, and human ageing as well in molecular interactions and evolution.","NA"

We studied latitudinal variation in the basal cold tolerance and body colour of two highly cold-tolerant Drosophila virilis group species, D. montana and D. flavomontana, in climatically diverse locations in North America. D. montana, which is generally found on higher latitudes and altitudes than D. flavomontana, was darker and more cold-tolerant than D. flavomontana. In D. montana, only fly cold tolerance showed latitudinal variation, while in D. flavomontana both traits varied according to latitude and local climatic conditions, but showed no correlation with each other. We also examined the role of a circadian clock gene vrille and an insulin-signalling pathway gene vitellogenin in the basal cold tolerance and cold acclimation ability of D. montana females using RNA interference. Silencing of vrille induced expression changes in the period, but not clock gene, and decreased flies' basal cold tolerance and cold acclimation ability, while silencing of vitellogenin affected only cold acclimation. Our study demonstrates that the dependence of insect cold tolerance on latitudinally varying factors and local climatic conditions may vary even between closely-related species. Furthermore, we propose that a functional circadian clock system plays an essential role both in insect basal cold tolerance and cold acclimation ability, and that vitellogenin affects cold acclimation likely through its interactions with other genes in the insulin-signalling pathway.","NA"

Most methods require large sample sizes or breeding designs that can be prohibitively difficult. Here we apply a rarely used approach to identify SNP loci associated with a complex phenotype. We mate siblings from isofemale lines isolate genotypes from three wild populations. After phenotyping we perform whole genome sequencing of isofemale lines from the extremes of the phenotypic distribution of each population and identify SNPs that are consistently fixed for alternative alleles across line pairs. The focal phenotype is female re-mating rate in the fly Drosophila pseudoobscura, defined as the willingness of a female to mate with a second male after her first mating. This is an integral part of mating system evolution, sexual selection and sexual conflict, and is a quantitative polygenic trait. About 200 SNPs are consistently fixed for alternate alleles in the three pairs of isofemale lines. We use different simulation approaches to explore how many SNPs would be expected to be fixed. We find the surprising result that we uncover fewer observed fixed SNPs than are expected by either simulation approach. We also complete functional analyses of these SNPs. Many lie near genes or regulatory regions known to be involved in Drosophila courtship and mating behaviours, and some have previously been associated with re-mating rates in Genome-Wide Association Studies. Given the small sample size, these results should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, this study suggests that even from a relatively small number of isofemale lines established from wild populations, it is possible to identify candidate loci potentially associated with a complex quantitative trait. However, further work is required to understand modelling the expected distribution of differences.","NA"

Here we present a bioinformatic pipeline optimised for the identification and assessment of ancient metagenomic DNA without the use of expensive DNA capture techniques. Our pipeline actively conserves aDNA reads, allowing the application of a bioinformatic approach by identifying the shortest reads possible for analysis (22-28bp). The time required for processing is drastically reduced through the use of a 10% segmented non-redundant sequence file (229 hours to 53). Processing speed is improved through the optimisation of BLAST parameters (53 hours to 48). Additionally, the use of multi-alignment authentication in the identification of taxa increases overall confidence of metagenomic results. DNA yields are further increased through the use of an optimal MAPQ setting (MAPQ 25) and the optimisation of the duplicate removal process using multiple sequence identifiers (a 4.35-6.88% better retention). Moreover, characteristic aDNA damage patterns are used to bioinformatically assess ancient vs. modern DNA origin throughout pipeline development. Of additional value, this pipeline uses open-source technologies, which increases its accessibility to the scientific community.","NA"

We show that antigen internalization depends both on clathrin-coated pits and on clathrin-independent endocytosis mediated by endophilin A2. Although endophilin A2 is dispensable for presentation of the endocytosed antigen, it is required for metabolic support of germinal center (GC) B cell proliferation, in part through regulation of iron uptake.

Given the rapid emergence of this pathogen, little is known about its genetic variation, immune system interactions, population prevalence, and environmental distribution. As a result, there is a pressing clinical and public health need for scalable molecular technologies that can rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and robustly interrogate strain evolution and host response in patients. To address these challenges, we designed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection within 30 minutes of application, including directly from lysed cells. Simultaneously, we developed a large-scale host and viral transcriptomic profiling platform that employs total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Applying both technologies to 442 samples, spanning 338 clinical samples tested for SARS-CoV-2, 86 environmental samples from the NYC subway, and 14 controls, we assembled a broad molecular picture of the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC. We found close concordance between viral titers measured with our rapid LAMP assay, RNA-seq, and the state-of-the-art RT-PCR. Full transcriptomic analyses revealed a distinct subset of the Western European clade A2a as the predominant genomic subtype in NYC cases, which was defined by two single nucleotide variants in nsp2 and ORF 3a and a clade-specific, 9-bp in-frame deletion in the virulence factor nsp1. High SARS-Cov2 viral titers were associated with distinct host transcriptional responses, including activation of the ACE2 gene and interferon response genes (e.g., IFIT1). Since ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) can also increase ACE2 expression, outcomes for patients taking ACEIs were examined, and showed a significantly increased risk of intubation and death. Our results demonstrate the utility of two molecular diagnostic platforms in defining the genetic features of an evolving global pandemic and provide insights that can aid future COVID-19 diagnostics, public health monitoring, and therapeutic options.","NA"

Protective antigen, the translocon component of this AB toxin, forms an oligomeric pore with three key clamp sites that aid in the efficient entry of lethal factor or edema factor, the enzymatic components of the toxin, into the cell. LF and EF translocate through the protective antigen pore with the pH gradient between the endosome and the cytosol acting as the driving force. Structural details of the translocation process have remained elusive despite their biological importance. To overcome the technical challenges of studying translocation intermediates, we developed a novel method to immobilize, transition, and stabilize anthrax toxin. Here, we report a cryoEM snapshot of PApore translocating the N-terminal domain of LF. The resulting 3.1 and 3.2 angstrom structures of the complex trace LFN as it unfolds near the alpha clamp, translocates through the phi clamp, and begins to refold in the charge clamp. In addition, helical density inside the beta barrel channel suggests LF secondary structural elements begin to refold at the charge clamp site. We conclude the anthrax toxin uses an extended beta barrel to efficiently fold the enzymatic payload prior to channel exit. This refolding mechanism has broader implications for pore length of other protein translocating toxins.","NA"

By analyzing FLC silencing in natural variants throughout winter in three field sites, we find that FLC starting levels and early phases of silencing are the major variables underlying vernalization response, rather than establishment of epigenetic silencing. This results in an intricate interplay between promotion and delay of flowering to balance survival, and through a post-vernalization effect of FLC, reproductive effort via branch production.

Loss of F508 causes NBD1 to be less thermodynamically stable and prevents proper tertiary folding of CFTR. As a result, CFTR is not properly trafficked to the cell surface. Recently, progress has been made towards the development of small molecule correctors that can restore CFTR tertiary structure and stabilize the channel to overcome the instability inherent in {Delta}F508-CFTR. However, the resultant improvement in channel activity has been modest, and the need for potent correctors remains.

The current study employed a systematic, multidisciplinary approach which aimed to model the effects of telomere shortening on human hippocampal neurogenesis, and to explore its relationship with cognition and psychiatric disorder risk. We modelled telomere shortening in human hippocampal progenitor cells in vitro using a serial passaging protocol that mimics the end-replication problem. Aged progenitors demonstrated shorter telomeres (p<0.05), and reduced rates of cell proliferation, as marked by bromodeoxyuridine staining (p<0.001), with no changes in the ability of cells to differentiate into neurons or glia. RNA-sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis revealed an effect of cell ageing on gene networks related to neurogenesis, telomere maintenance, cell senescence and cytokine production.

Using a method that instead learns the statistical distribution of the cortical electrical fields and predicts values of missing electrodes may yield better results.

We demonstrate that ubiquitylation of TOM20, a component of the outer mitochondrial membrane import machinery that directly interacts with USP30, represents a robust biomarker for both USP30 loss and inhibition. We have conducted proteomics analyses on a SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cell line model to directly compare the effects of genetic loss of USP30 with selective inhibition in an unbiased fashion. We have thereby identified a subset of ubiquitylation events consequent to mitochondrial depolarisation that are USP30 sensitive. Within responsive elements of the ubiquitylome, several components of the outer mitochondrial membrane transport (TOM) complex are most prominent. Thus, our data support a model whereby USP30 can regulate the availability of ubiquitin at the specific site of mitochondrial PINK1 accumulation following membrane depolarisation.

While environmental factors are implicated in opioid addiction, less is known about the role of exposure to environmental pollutants on the brain opioid system. Human and preclinical studies have suggested an association between childhood lead (Pb2+) intoxication and proclivity to substance abuse and delinquent behavior. Opioid receptors are involved in the biological effects of opioids and other drugs of abuse. In this study, we examine the effect of chronic developmental Pb2+ exposure on m-opioid receptor (MOR) levels in the rat brain using [3H]-D-Ala2-MePhe4-Gly-ol5 enkephalin ([3H]-DAMGO) quantitative receptor autoradiography. Our results indicate that chronic developmental Pb2+ exposure increases the levels of [3H]-DAMGO specific binding to MOR in several limbic regions of the brain in male and female rats during the pre-adolescence (PN14) and early-adolescence (PN28) period. These changes were less pronounced in late-adolescence (PN50) and adult (PN120) animals. Our findings are important because the pre-adolescence and early adolescence period is a time in which there is higher engagement in reward and drug-seeking behaviors in humans. In summary, we show that chronic exposure to Pb2+ an ubiquitous and well-known environmental contaminant and neurotoxicant, alters MOR levels in brain regions associated with addiction circuits in the adolescent period with important implications to opioid drug use and abuse.","NA"

Here, we report on another risk: the accelerated infectious disease risk associated with the number and geographic spread of human infectious disease outbreaks. Using the most complete, reliable, and up-to-date database on human infectious disease outbreaks (GIDEON), we show that the number of disease outbreaks, the number of diseases involved in these outbreaks, and the number of countries affected have increased during the entire Anthropocene. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of these outbreaks is becoming more globalized in the sense that the overall modularity of the disease networks across the globe has decreased, meaning disease outbreaks have become increasingly pandemic in their nature. This decrease in modularity is correlated with the increase in air traffic. We finally show that those countries and regions which are most central within these disease networks tend to be countries with higher GDPs. Therefore, one cost of increased global mobility and greater economic growth is the increased risk of disease outbreaks and their faster and wider spread. We briefly discuss three different scenarios which decision-makers might follow in light of our results.","NA"

Using a reverse genetic approach, we compared hypomethylated RNAi-ddm1 lines to wild-type trees for drought tolerance. An integrative analysis was realized with phytohormone balance, methylomes, transcriptomes and mobilomes. Hypomethylated lines were more tolerant when subjected to moderate water deficit and were intrinsically more tolerant to drought-induced cavitation. The alteration of the DDM1 machinery induced variation in DNA methylation in a cytosine context dependent manner, both in genes and transposable elements. Hypomethylated lines subjected to water deficit showed altered expression of genes involved in phytohormone pathways, such as salicylic acid and modified hormonal balance. Several transposable elements showed stress- and/or line-specific patterns of reactivation, and we could detect copy number variations for two of them in stressed ddm1 lines. Overall, our data highlight two major roles for DNA methylation in the shoot apical meristem: control of stress response and plasticity through transduction of hormone signaling and maintenance of genome integrity through the control of transposable elements.","NA"

Here we describe a chemically defined xeno-free method for generating VEC-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) through an intermediate endocardium stage. HPSCs were initially specified to KDR+/ISL1+ multipotent cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), followed by differentiation into endocardial progenitors under the combined treatment with VEGFA, BMP4 and bFGF. In the presence of VEGFA, BMP4 and TGFb, valve endocardial progenitor cells (VEPs) were efficiently derived from endocardial progenitors without a sorting step. Mechanistically, administration of TGFb and BMP4 may specify the VEP fate by facilitating the expression of key transcription factors ETV2 and NFATc1 at the immediate early stage and by activating Notch signaling at the later stage. Notch activation is likely an important part of VEP induction. HPSC-derived VEPs exhibited morphological, molecular and functional similarities to that of the primary VECs isolated from normal human aortic valves. When hPSC-derived VEPs were seeded onto the surface of the de-cellularized porcine aortic valve (DCV) matrix scaffolds, they exhibited higher proliferation and survival potential than HUVEC or the primary VECs. Our results suggest that hPSC-derived VEPs could serve as as a potential platform for the study of valve development, and as starting materials for the construction of the next generation TEVs.","NA"

The virus having its roots in Wuhan (China) has been spread over the world by its own property to change itself accordingly. These changes correspond to its transmission and pathogenicity due to which the concept of social distancing appeared into the picture. In this paper, a few findings from the whole genome sequence analysis of viral genome sequences submitted from India are presented. The data used for analysis comprises 440 collective genome sequences of virus submitted in GenBank, GISAID, and SRA projects, from around the world as well as 28 viral sequences from India. Multiple sequence alignment of all genome sequences was performed and analysed. A novel non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T (S1515F) in NSP3 gene of SARS-CoV2 Indian strains is reported along with other frequent and important changes from around the world: 3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G. The novel change was observed in samples collected in the month of March, whereas was found to be absent in samples collected in January with the respective persons travel history to China. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the sequences with this change as one separate clade. Mutation was predicted as stabilising change by insilco tool DynaMut. A second patient in the world to our knowledge with multiple (Wuhan and USA) strain contraction was observed in this study. The infected person is among the two early infected patients with travel history to China. Strains sequenced in Iran stood out to have different variants, as most of the reported frequent variants were not observed. The objective of this paper is to highlight the similarities and changes observed in the submitted Indian viral strains. This helps to keep track on the activity, that how virus is changing into a new subtype. Major strains observed were European with the novel change in India and other being emergent clade of Iran. Its important to observe the changes in NSP3 gene, as this gene has been reported with extensive positive selection as well as potential drug target. Extensive Positive Selection Drives the Evolution of Nonstructural Proteins. With the limited number of sequences this was the only frequent novel non-synonymous change observed from Indian strains, thereby making this change vulnerable for investigation in future.

Here we show that the dramatically disorganized mitochondria caused by a mitochondrial fission-defective dynamin mutation is strongly suppressed to a more periodic pattern by a second mutation in lysosomal biogenesis or acidification. Vitamin B12 is normally imported from the bacterial diet via lysosomal degradation of B12-binding proteins and transport of vitamin B12 to the mitochondrion and cytoplasm. We show that the lysosomal dysfunction induced by gene inactivations of lysosomal biogenesis or acidification factors causes vitamin B12 deficiency. Growth of the C. elegans dynamin mutant on an E. coli strain with low vitamin B12 also strongly suppressed the mitochondrial fission defect. Of the two C. elegans enzymes that require B12, gene inactivation of methionine synthase suppressed the mitochondrial fission defect of a dynamin mutation. We show that lysosomal dysfunction induced mitochondrial biogenesis which is mediated by vitamin B12 deficiency and methionine restriction. S-adenosylmethionine, the methyl donor of many methylation reactions, including histones, is synthesized from methionine by S-adenosylmethionine synthase; inactivation of the sams-1 S-adenosylmethionine synthase also suppresses the drp-1 fission defect, suggesting that vitamin B12 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and then affects mitochondrial fission via chromatin pathways.","NA"

However, information on gene-Mendelian disease associations, rare pathogenic mutations driving the disease, and the disease phenotype ontology is dispersed across many data sources and does not integrate easily with enrichment analysis. MendelVar is a new webserver facilitating transfer of knowledge from Mendelian disease research into interpretation of genetic associations from GWAS of complex traits. MendelVar allows querying of pre-defined or LD-determined genomic intervals against a comprehensive integrated database to find overlap with genes linked to Mendelian disease. Next, MendelVar looks for enrichment of any Human Phenotype Ontology, Disease Ontology and other ontology/pathway terms associated with identified Mendelian genes. In addition, MendelVar provides a list of all overlapping pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for Mendelian disease sourced from ClinVar. Inclusion of information obtained from MendelVar in post-GWAS gene annotation pipelines can strengthen the case for causal importance of some genes. Moreover, as genes with Mendelian disease evidence may make for more successful drug targets, this may be particularly useful in drug discovery pipelines. Taking GWAS summary statistics for male-pattern baldness, intelligence and atopic dermatitis, we demonstrate the use of MendelVar in prioritizing candidate genes at these loci which are linked to relevant enriched ontology terms.

Expanding virus populations, as that of SARS-CoV-2, accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods. In this context, approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the SARS-CoV-2 population are necessary for a robust clustering. Here, we proposed the subdivision of the global SARS-CoV-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ORF8) genes. Six virus subtypes were predominant in the population, but all sixteen showed amino acid replacements which might have phenotypic implications. We hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world, a typical founder effect. The genetic structure determined for the SARS-CoV-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs.","NA"

We found no relationship between genetic diversity and stand total biomass. Increasing stand genetic diversity did increase fecundity in high resource conditions. Polyculture (multiple genotypes) stands consistently yielded less biomass than expected based on the yields of component genotypes in monoculture. This under-yielding was strongest in stands with late-flowering and high biomass genotypes, potentially due to interference competition by these genotypes. Using a new implementation of association mapping, we identified genetic loci whose diversity was associated with stand-level yield, revealing a major flowering time locus associated with under-yielding of polycultures. Our field experiment supports community ecology studies that find a range of diversity-function relationships in the field.

Efficient identification of subtypes is particularly important for tracking the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of infectious spread in real-time. In this paper, we utilize an entropy analysis to identify nucleotide sites within SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences that are highly informative of genetic variation, and thereby define an Informative Subtype Marker (ISM) for each sequence. We further apply an error correction technique to the ISMs, for more robust subtype definition given ambiguity and noise in sequence data. We show that, by analyzing the ISMs of global SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, we can distinguish interregional differences in viral subtype distribution, and track the emergence of subtypes in different regions over time. Based on publicly available data up to April 5, 2020, we show, for example: (1) distinct genetic subtypes of infections in Europe, with earlier transmission linked to subtypes prevalent in Italy with later development of subtypes specific to other countries over time; (2) within the United States, the emergence of an endogenous U.S. subtype that is distinct from the outbreak in New York, which is linked instead to subtypes found in Europe; and (3) dynamic emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from localization in China to a pattern of distinct regional subtypes in different countries around the world over time. Our results demonstrate that utilizing ISMs for genetic subtyping can be an important complement to conventional phylogenetic tree-based analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, because ISMs are efficient and compact subtype identifiers, they will be useful for modeling, data-mining, and machine learning tools to help enhance containment, therapeutic, and vaccine targeting strategies for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

To investigate whether the mutations in the RBD have altered the receptor binding affinity and whether these strains are selected to be more infectious, we analyzed and assessed the binding dynamics between the mutant SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to date and the human ACE2 receptor. Among 1609 genomes of global SARS-CoV-2 strains, 32 RBD mutants were identified and clustered into 9 mutant types under high positive selection pressure. Three mutant types that emerged in Wuhan, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and France, displayed higher human ACE2 affinity, and probably higher infectivity. This is due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. Five France isolates and one Hong Kong isolate shared the same RBD mutation (V367F). 13 V483A mutants and seven G476S mutants were also identified from the U.S.A. This suggested they originated as novel sub-lineages. The enhancement of the binding affinity of the mutant type (V367F) was further validated by the receptor-ligand binding ELISA assay. The molecular dynamics simulations also indicated that it would be difficult for bat SARS-like CoV to infect humans. However, the pangolin CoV is potentially infectious to humans. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 under high selection pressure.

In an fMRI drug cue-reactivity task, the presence of rapid habituation or sensitization was investigated by modeling time and its interaction with condition (drug>neutral) using an initial discovery-sample. Replication of this temporal response was tested in two other clinical populations. Methods: Sixty-five male participants (35.8+-8.4 years-old) with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) were recruited as the discovery-sample. A linear mixed effects model was used to identify areas with a time-by-condition interaction in the discovery-sample. Replication of these effects was tested in two other samples (29 female with MUD and 22 male with opioid use disorder). The second replication-sample was re-tested within two weeks. Results: In the discovery-sample, clusters within the VMPFC, amygdala and ventral striatum showed both significant condition and condition-by-time interaction with a habituation response for the drug-related cues but not neutral cues. The estimates for the main effects and interactions were generally consistent between the discovery and replication-samples across all clusters. The re-test data showed consistent lack of drug>neutral and habituation response within all selected clusters in the second cue-exposure session. Conclusions: VMPFC, amygdala and ventral striatum show a habituation in response to drug-related cues which is consistent among different clinical populations. Habituation in response in the first session of cue-exposure and lack of reactivity in the second session of exposure provide foundations for development of cue-desensitization interventions.","NA"

This perceptual benefit is thought to stem from the neural integration of visual and auditory speech at multiple stages of processing, whereby movement of a speaker's face provides temporal cues to auditory cortex, and articulatory information from the speaker's mouth can aid recognizing specific linguistic units (e.g., phonemes, syllables). However it remains unclear how the integration of these cues varies as a function of listening conditions. Here we sought to provide insight on these questions by examining EEG responses to natural audiovisual, audio, and visual speech in quiet and in noise. Specifically, we represented our speech stimuli in terms of their spectrograms and their phonetic features, and then quantified the strength of the encoding of those features in the EEG using canonical correlation analysis. The encoding of both spectrotemporal and phonetic features was shown to be more robust in audiovisual speech responses then what would have been expected from the summation of the audio and visual speech responses, consistent with the literature on multisensory integration. Furthermore, the strength of this multisensory enhancement was more pronounced at the level of phonetic processing for speech in noise relative to speech in quiet, indicating that listeners rely more on articulatory details from visual speech in challenging listening conditions. These findings support the notion that the integration of audio and visual speech is a flexible, multistage process that adapts to optimize comprehension based on the current listening conditions.","NA"

Here, we report a genome-editing tool at a one-nucleotide resolution, namely base editing, for acetogenic bacteria based on CRISPR-targeted deamination. This tool combines nuclease deactivated Cas9 with activation-induced cytidine deaminase to enable cytosine-to-thymine substitution without DNA cleavage, homology-directed repair, and donor DNA, which are generally the bottlenecks for applying conventional CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria. We designed and validated a modularized base-editing tool in the model acetogenic bacterium Clostridium ljungdahlii. The editing principles were investigated, and an in-silico analysis revealed the capability of base editing across the genome. Moreover, genes related to acetate and ethanol production were disrupted individually by installing premature STOP codons to reprogram carbon flux towards improved acetate production. This resulted in engineered C. ljungdahlii strains with the desired phenotypes and stable genotypes. Our base-editing tool promotes the application and research in acetogenic bacteria and provides a blueprint to upgrade CRISPR-Cas-based genome editing in bacteria in general.","NA"

The global increase in species richness toward the tropics across continents and taxonomic groups stimulated the formulation of many hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of this pattern. We evaluated several of these hypotheses to explain spatial diversity patterns in the butterfly family, Nymphalidae, by assessing the contributions of speciation, extinction, and dispersal to the LDG, and also the extent to which these processes differ among regions at the same latitude. We generated a new, time-calibrated phylogeny of Nymphalidae based on 10 gene fragments and containing ca. 2,800 species (~45% of extant diversity). Neither speciation nor extinction rate variations consistently explain the LDG among regions because temporal diversification dynamics differ greatly across longitude. For example, we found that Neotropical nymphalid diversity results from low extinction rates, not high speciation rates, and that biotic interchanges with other regions were rare. Southeast Asia was also characterized by a low speciation rate but, unlike the Neotropics, was the main source of dispersal events through time. Our results suggest that global climate change throughout the Cenozoic, particularly during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, combined with the conserved ancestral tropical niches, played a major role in generating the modern LDG of butterflies.","NA"

A recent study showed the significant correlations among nose, body, and testis sizes and the clear association between nose size and the number of females in a male's harem. However, to date, the analyses of other common male traits, i.e., canines, are lacking. Whereas male nose size had a positive correlation with body size, we unexpectedly found a negative correlation between body and canine sizes. A similar relationship between nose and body size was observed in females, whereas only a weak correlation was noted between canine and body size. We explain this by an interaction between sexual and natural selection. Larger noses in males may interfere with the use of canines, thereby reducing their effectiveness as weapons. Additionally, longer canines are opposed by natural selection because they impose a larger gape upon its bearer and reduce foraging efficiency, particularly in folivores. The difference between the sexes regarding the regression intercept for body size vs. canine size was significant, although the difference of the slopes was insignificant, consistent with the hypothesis that the nose interferes with the effectiveness of canines as weapons in males but not in females. Moreover, a mathematical simulation supported our prediction. This unique case of decoupling of body and canine size reveals that large canines carry an ecological cost. It also raises interesting questions regarding the developmental mechanism that produces a negative correlation among adult body, nose size, and canine size.","NA"

Around the same time, David Tilman demonstrated that increased nutrient loading would also be expected to cause competitive exclusion leading to deleterious changes in food web diversity. While both concepts have greatly illuminated general diversity-stability theory, we currently lack a coherent framework to predict how nutrients influence food web stability across a landscape. This is a vitally important gap in our understanding, given mounting evidence of serious ecological disruption arising from anthropogenic displacement of resources and organisms. Here, we combine contemporary theory on food webs and meta-ecosystems to show that nutrient additions are indeed expected to drive loss in stability and function in human-impacted regions. However, this loss in stability occurs not just from wild oscillations in population abundance, but more frequently from the complete loss of an equilibrium due to edible plant species being competitively excluded. In highly modified landscapes, spatial nutrient transport theory suggests that such instabilities can be amplified over vast distances from the sites of nutrient addition. Consistent with this theoretical synthesis, the empirical frequency of these distant propagating ecosystem imbalances appears to be growing. This synthesis of theory and empirical data suggests that human modification of the earths ecological connectivity is entangling once distantly separated ecosystems, causing rapid, expansive, and costly nutrient-driven instabilities over vast areas of the planet. The corollary to this spatial nutrient theory, though, akin to weak interaction theory from food web networks, is that slow spatial nutrient pathways can be potent stabilizers by moderating flows across a landscape.","NA"

It has been argued that this should be considered in removal decisions for offshore infrastructure. World-wide, high numbers of oil and gas installations will be decommissioned in the coming years. Most will be removed, but some will be left in place or relocated to be used as artificial reefs. In the North Sea leaving in place is prohibited but derogations are allowed for gravity based concrete installations. One of the few Dutch concrete platform foundations is the Halfweg gravity based structure (GBS). Halfweg stopped production in 2016, which was followed by decommissioning and removal of the topside and legs of the structure. Currently, only the GBS remains. The owner Petrogas is evaluating options of removal of the GBS and is considering removal and leave-in-place scenarios. To facilitate this evaluation, a study on the fouling macrofauna community on the structure was performed. Samples were taken by commercial scientific divers and species identified, counted and weighed. The results were compared to similar data from box corer samples from the surrounding seabed within 30 km from the Halfweg GBS and to samples from other oil and gas and wind farm structures and a natural rocky reef. In total, 65 macrobenthic species were observed in 39 samples from the concrete GBS (52 species), steel legs (32) and surrounding rock dump (44). Simpson diversity index was highest on the rock dump at Halfweg (0.71) but concrete (0.54) as well as steel (0.60) were lower than seabed (0.69). 14 of the species on Halfweg were not found in any of the other investigated substrates. Only 10 species on Halfweg were also observed in the surrounding sandy seabed. 31% of the species found in the Borkum Reef Grounds were also observed on Halfweg. Arthropoda contained the most abundant species on Halfweg, with Monocorophium acherusicum, Jassa herdmani, Phtisica marina and Stenothoe monoculoides composing 98% of the abundance on the GBS. Mean ash free dry weight was significantly higher (p<0.001) on the Halfweg substrates (204 g AFDW per m2) than on the surrounding seabed (65 g AFDW per m2). Between 94 and 99% of the biomass on Halfweg consisted of the plumose anemone Metridium senile. This species was absent from the sandy seabed but common on the other reefs. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed a strong clustering of the reef samples including Halfweg away from the cluster of sandy seabed samples. PERMANOVA showed this was due to differences in habitat type (p<0.001). The total biomass on the concrete GBS was estimated to be 262 kg AFDW, with 20 kg on the steel legs and 2,563 kg on the surrounding rock dump, 2,846 kg AFDW in total. The area of seabed covered by these hard substrates was 3,617 m2. A similar area of seabed without concrete structure and rocks would have contained 232 kg AFDW of macrofauna. The presence of Halfweg therefore increases the local biomass a 12-fold. The results show that the Halfweg structures significantly increase local biodiversity and biomass. Several of the species observed on Halfweg were not reported from the local seabed or other reefs. Removal of the gravity based foundation will significantly reduce local macrofauna biodiversity. Due to the scattering of rock dump after removal, long term local impact on macrofouling biomass is considered low. Leaving the GBS in place as it is will result in the highest number of species conserved to the area.","NA"

Given the rapid emergence of this pathogen, little is known about its genetic variation, immune system interactions, population prevalence, and environmental distribution. As a result, there is a pressing clinical and public health need for scalable molecular technologies that can rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and robustly interrogate strain evolution and host response in patients. To address these challenges, we designed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection within 30 minutes of application, including directly from lysed cells. Simultaneously, we developed a large-scale host and viral transcriptomic profiling platform that employs total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Applying both technologies to 442 samples, spanning 338 clinical samples tested for SARS-CoV-2, 86 environmental samples from the NYC subway, and 14 controls, we assembled a broad molecular picture of the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC. We found close concordance between viral titers measured with our rapid LAMP assay, RNA-seq, and the state-of-the-art RT-PCR. Full transcriptomic analyses revealed a distinct subset of the Western European clade A2a as the predominant genomic subtype in NYC cases, which was defined by two single nucleotide variants in nsp2 and ORF 3a and a clade-specific, 9-bp in-frame deletion in the virulence factor nsp1. High SARS-Cov2 viral titers were associated with distinct host transcriptional responses, including activation of the ACE2 gene and interferon response genes (e.g., IFIT1). Since ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) can also increase ACE2 expression, outcomes for patients taking ACEIs were examined, and showed a significantly increased risk of intubation and death. Our results demonstrate the utility of two molecular diagnostic platforms in defining the genetic features of an evolving global pandemic and provide insights that can aid future COVID-19 diagnostics, public health monitoring, and therapeutic options.","NA"

Here we use Structure-seq2 to probe the in vivo RNA structurome of Bacillus subtilis grown in the presence and absence of amino acids. Our results reveal that amino acid starvation results in lower overall dimethyl sulfate (DMS) reactivity of the transcriptome, indicating enhanced protection owing to protein binding or RNA structure. Starvation-induced changes in DMS reactivity correlated inversely with transcript abundance changes. This correlation was particularly pronounced in genes associated with the stringent response and CodY regulons, which are involved in adaptation to nutritional stress, suggesting that RNA structure contributes to transcript abundance change in regulons involved in amino acid metabolism. Structure-seq2 accurately reported on four known amino acid-responsive riboswitches: T-box, SAM, glycine, and lysine riboswitches. Additionally, we discovered a transcription attenuation mechanism that reduces yfmG expression when amino acids are added to the growth medium. We also found that translation of a leader peptide (YfmH) encoded just upstream of yfmG regulates yfmG expression. Our results are consistent with a model in which a slow rate of yfmH translation caused by limitation of the amino acids encoded in YfmH prevents transcription termination in the yfmG leader region by favoring formation of an overlapping antiterminator structure. This novel RNA switch offers a way to simultaneously monitor the levels of multiple amino acids.","NA"

The high efficiency of the activation domain relies on the host plant. However, no activation domain has been identified that originates from Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolate). In this study, a novel strong activator was identified from the whole Chinese fir cDNA library. This plant conserved activator was named TAC 3 (Transcriptional Activation domain from Chinese fir 3). C-terminal 70 amino acids of TAC (TAC3d) have a stronger ability than the commonly used strong activation domain of the virus protein VP16, or the strong plant activation domain, EDLL, in Chinese fir. Through Dual-luciferase assay, phenomic analysis and FT (Flowering Locus T [FT]) quantification, it was shown that, TAC3d can overcome the transcriptional repression of strong plant repressors (Flowering Locus C [FLC]) when fused to its C-terminal domain, thus inhibit the repression of FT expression. In conclusion, for the first time, an activation domain has been identified from Chinese fir. TAC3, which can be used for precise gene activation in Chinese fir in the future, and its function in the plant is more powerful than the commonly used strong activation domain (such as VP16 and EDLL).","NA"

Chloroplasts integrate nearly all thylakoid transmembrane proteins post-translationally, but mechanisms in the stroma that assist their insertion remain largely undefined. Here, we investigated how the chloroplast chaperonin (Cpn60) facilitated the thylakoid integration of Plastidic type I signal peptidase 1 (Plsp1) using in vitro targeting assays. Cpn60 bound Plsp1 in the stroma. In isolated chloroplasts, the membrane integration of imported Plsp1 correlated with its dissociation from Cpn60. When the Plsp1 residues that interacted with Cpn60 were removed, Plsp1 did not integrate into the membrane. These results suggested Cpn60 was an intermediate in Plsp1's thylakoid targeting. In isolated thylakoids, the integration of Plsp1 decreased if Cpn60 was present in excess of cpSecA1, the stromal motor of the cpSec1 translocon which inserts unfolded Plsp1 into the thylakoid. An excess of cpSecA1 favored integration. Introducing Cpn60's obligate substrate RbcL displaced Cpn60-bound Plsp1; then, the released Plsp1 exhibited increased accessibility to cpSec1. These in vitro targeting experiments support a model in which Cpn60 captures and then releases insertion-competent Plsp1, while cpSecA1 recognizes free Plsp1 for integration. Thylakoid transmembrane proteins transiting the stroma can interact with Cpn60 to shield from the aqueous environment.","NA"

When Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings are grown in the dark, hypocotyl elongation is promoted, whereas root growth is greatly reduced as a result of changes in hormone transport and a reduction in meristematic cell proliferation. Previous work showed that the microtubule-associated protein CLASP sustains root apical meristem (RAM) size by influencing microtubule (MT) organization and by modulating the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway. Here, we investigated whether CLASP is involved in light-dependent root growth promotion, since dark-grown seedlings have reduced RAM activity that is observed in the clasp-1 null mutant. We showed that CLASP protein levels were greatly reduced in the root tips of dark-grown seedlings, which could be reversed by exposing plants to light. We confirmed that removing seedlings from the light led to a discernible shift in MT organization from bundled arrays, which are prominent in dividing cells, to transverse orientations typically observed in cells that have exited the meristem. BR receptors and auxin transporters, both of which are sustained by CLASP, were largely degraded in the dark. Interestingly, we found that despite the lack of protein, CLASP transcript levels were higher in dark-grown root tips. Together, these findings uncover a mechanism that sustains meristem homeostasis through CLASP, and advances our understanding of how roots modulate their growth according to the amount of light and nutrients perceived by the plant.","NA"

The activation of ATR occurs as a reaction to UV- and chemotherapeutic drug-induced replication stress. In this study, we examined the effect of ATR inhibition on 5-FU sensitivity. Using western blotting, we found that 5-FU treatment led to the phosphorylation of ATR. Surviving fractions were remarkably decreased in 5-FU with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) compared to 5-FU with other major DNA repair kinases inhibitors. ATR inhibition enhanced induction of DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis in 5-FU-treated cells. Using gene expression analysis, we found that 5-FU could induce the activation of intra-S checkpoint. Surprisingly, BRCA2-deficient cells were sensitive to 5-FU in the presence of ATRi.

Cell membrane bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and associated proteases, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Cathepsin L (CTSL), were previously identified as mediators of SARS-CoV2 cellular entry. Here, we assess the cell type-specific RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL through an integrated analysis of 107 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq studies, including 22 lung and airways datasets (16 unpublished), and 85 datasets from other diverse organs. Joint expression of ACE2 and the accessory proteases identifies specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells as putative targets of viral infection in the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli. Cells that co-express ACE2 and proteases are also identified in cells from other organs, some of which have been associated with COVID-19 transmission or pathology, including gut enterocytes, corneal epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, heart pericytes, olfactory sustentacular cells, and renal epithelial cells. Performing the first meta-analyses of scRNA-seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking, all of which are epidemiologically linked to COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Notably, there was a particularly low expression of ACE2 in the few young pediatric samples in the analysis. Further analysis reveals a gene expression program shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues, including genes that may mediate viral entry, subtend key immune functions, and mediate epithelial-macrophage cross-talk. Amongst these are IL6, its receptor and co-receptor, IL1R, TNF response pathways, and complement genes. Cell type specificity in the lung and airways and smoking effects were conserved in mice. Our analyses suggest that differences in the cell type-specific expression of mediators of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry may be responsible for aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology and clinical course, and point to putative molecular pathways involved in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.","NA"

These viruses usually cause a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infection, however, they can also cause more severe symptoms, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases. These viruses are capable of flexibly adapting to new environments, hence health threats from coronavirus are constant and long-term. Immunogenic spike proteins are glyco-proteins found on the surface of Coronaviridae particles that mediate entry to host cells. The aim of this study was to train deep learning neural networks to produce simulated spike protein sequences, which may be able to aid in knowledge and/or vaccine design by creating alternative possible spike sequences that could arise from zoonotic sources in future. Results: Here we have trained deep learning recurrent neural networks (RNN) to provide computer simulated coronavirus spike protein sequences in the style of previously known sequences and examine their characteristics. Training used a dataset of alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus spike sequences. In a test set of 100 simulated sequences, all 100 had most significant BLAST matches to Spike proteins in searches against NCBI non-redundant dataset (NR) and also possessed concomitant Pfam domain matches. Conclusions: Simulated sequences from the neural network may be able to guide us in future with prospective targets for vaccine discovery in advance of a potential novel zoonosis. We may effectively be able to fast-forward through evolution using neural networks to investigate sequences that could arise.","NA"

Here, we compared a variety of replication features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and analysed the cytopathology caused by the two closely related viruses in the commonly used Vero E6 cell line. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 generated higher levels of intracellular viral RNA, but strikingly about 50-fold less infectious viral progeny was recovered from the culture medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells established extensive cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against a variety of nonstructural proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. Electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructural changes induced by the two SARS viruses are very similar and occur within comparable time frames after infection. Furthermore, we determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of coronavirus replication (Remdesivir, Alisporivir and chloroquine) is very similar, but that SARS-CoV-2 infection was substantially more sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with pegylated interferon alpha. An important difference between the two viruses is the fact that - upon passaging in Vero E6 cells - SARS-CoV-2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive mutations in its spike protein gene. These mutations change or delete a putative furin-like cleavage site in the region connecting the S1 and S2 domains and result in a very prominent phenotypic change in plaque assays.","NA"

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a ""sandwich"" complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1, can only bind to RBD in vitro but not have the blocking or neutralization activity.

However, the complete range of functions of PSEN1 and PSEN2 is not yet understood. In this study, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the zebrafish psen2 gene to generate a premature termination codon close downstream of the translation start with the intention of creating a null mutation. Homozygotes for this mutation, psen2S4Ter, are viable and fertile, and adults do not show any gross pigmentation defects, arguing against significant loss of {gamma}-secretase activity. Also, assessment of the numbers of Dorsal Longitudinal Ascending (DoLA) interneurons that are responsive to psen2 but not psen1 activity during embryogenesis did not reveal decreased psen2 function. Transcripts containing the S4Ter mutation show no evidence of destabilization by nonsense-mediated decay. Forced expression in zebrafish embryos of fusions of psen2S4Ter 5' mRNA sequences with sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) indicated that the psen2S4Ter mutation permits utilization of cryptic, novel downstream translation start codons. These likely initiate translation of N-terminally truncated Psen2 proteins that obey the ""reading frame preservation rule"" of PRESENILIN EOfAD mutations.

Risk management strategies to reduce aggregation are critical for cells to survive upon stresses that induce aggregation. Cells cope with protein aggregation by utilizing a variety of chaperones, as exemplified by heat-shock proteins (Hsps). The heat stress-induced expression of IbpA and IbpB, small Hsps in Escherichia coli, is regulated by the {sigma}32 heat-shock transcriptional regulator and the temperature-dependent translational regulation via mRNA heat fluctuation. We found that, even without heat stress, either the expression of aggregation-prone proteins or the ibpA gene deletion profoundly increases the expression of IbpA. Combined with other evidence, we propose novel mechanisms for the regulation of the small Hsp expression. Oligomeric IbpA self-represses the ibpA/ibpB expression at the translational level, but the self-repression is relieved by the sequestration of IbpA into protein aggregates. Thus, the function of IbpA as a chaperone to form co-aggregates is harnessed as an aggregation sensor to tightly regulate the IbpA level. Since the excessive preemptive supply of IbpA in advance of stress is harmful, the prodigious and rapid expression of IbpA/IbpB on demand is necessary for IbpA to function as a first line of defense against acute protein aggregation.","NA"

Here we demonstrate that macrophages derived from the bone marrow (BMDM) of S. mansoni infected male ApoE -/- mice have dramatically increased mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial mass compared to those from uninfected mice. This change is accompanied by increased glucose and palmitate shuttling into TCA cycle intermediates and decreased accumulation of cellular cholesterol esters. The systemic effects of metabolic modulation by schistosome infection are a function of biological sex, where schistosome infection protects ApoE -/- male mice from obesity, glucose intolerance, and increased serum triglycerides, but not female mice. The sex-dependent effects of infection extend to myeloid cells specifically, where metabolic reprogramming leads to opposite cholesterol phenotypes in BMDM from infected females and males. Finally, we demonstrate that the metabolic reprogramming of male myeloid cells is transferrable via bone marrow transplantation to an uninfected host, indicating maintenance of reprogramming in the absence of ongoing schistosome antigen exposure.

In this study, we designed a novel targeted ARVs-loaded nanoformulation that combines the CCR5 monoclonal antibody and antiretroviral drugs (ARV) as a dual protection strategy to promote HIV  functional cure. The modified CCR5 monoclonal antibody (xfR5 mAb) surface-coated dolutegravir (DTG) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) loaded nanoformulation (xfR5-D+T NPs) were uniformly sized <250 nm, with 6.5 times enhanced antigen-binding affinity compared to naive xfR5 mAb, and provided prolonged DTG and TAF intracellular retention (t1/2). The multivalent and sustained drug release properties of xfR5-D+T NPs enhance the protection efficiency against HIV by approximately 12, 3, and 5 times compared to naive xfR5 mAb, D+T NP alone, and xfR5 NPs, respectively. Further, the nanoformulation demonstrated high binding-affinity to CCR5 expressing CD4+ cells, monocytes, and other HIV prone/latent T-cells by 25, 2, and 2 times, respectively.

Carbohydrates within P. aeruginosa biofilms include neutral and mannose-rich Psl, and cationic Pel composed of N -acetyl-galactosamine and N -acetyl-glucosamine. Here we show that P. aeruginosa biofilms display ligands for the C-type lectin receptors mannose receptor (MR, CD206) and Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN, CD209). Binding of MR and DC-SIGN to P. aeruginosa biofilms is carbohydrate- and calcium-dependent and extends to biofilms formed by clinical isolates. Confocal analysis of P. aeruginosa biofilms shows abundant DC-SIGN ligands among bacteria aggregates while MR ligands concentrate into discrete clusters. DC-SIGN ligands are also detected in planktonic P. aeruginosa cultures and depend on the presence of the common polysaccharide antigen. Carbohydrates purified from P. aeruginosa biofilms are recognised by DC-SIGN and MR; both receptors preferentially bind the high molecular weight fraction (HMW; >132,000Da) with K D s in the nM range. HMW preparations contain 74.9-80.9% mannose, display a-mannan segments and alter the morphology of human dendritic cells without causing obvious changes in cytokine responses. Finally, HMW interferes with the endocytic activity of cell-associated MR and DC-SIGN. This work identifies MR and DC-SIGN as receptors for bacterial biofilms and highlights the potential for biofilm-associated carbohydrates as immunomodulators through engagement of C-type lectin receptors.","NA"

Hogan","Geisel School of Medicine of Dartmouth","2020-04-20",1,"cc_by","new results","microbiology","Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans are opportunistic pathogens whose interactions involve the secreted products ethanol and phenazines. Here we describe the focal role of ethanol, a common microbial metabolite, in mixed-species co-cultures by dual RNA-seq transcriptomic analyses. P. aeruginosa and C. albicans transcriptomes were assessed after growth in mono-culture or co-culture with either ethanol-producing C. albicans or a C. albicans mutant lacking the primary ethanol dehydrogenase, Adh1. Analyses using KEGG-pathways and the previously published eADAGE method revealed several P. aeruginosa responses to C. albicans-produced ethanol including the induction of a non-canonical low phosphate response mediated by PhoB. C. albicans wild-type, but not C. albicans adh1 {Delta}/{Delta}, induces P. aeruginosa production of 5-methyl-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5-MPCA), which forms a red derivative within fungal cells. We first demonstrate that PhoB is required for this interaction and that PhoB hyperactivity, via deletion of pstB, leads to increased production of 5-MPCA even when phosphate concentrations are high, but only in the presence of ethanol. Second, we show that ethanol is only sufficient to promote 5-MPCA production at permissive phosphate concentrations. The intersection of ethanol and phosphate in co-culture is mirrored in C. albicans; transcriptome analysis of the C. albicans WT and the ethanol-deficient adh1 {Delta}/{Delta} revealed that the adh1 {Delta}/{Delta} mutant had increased expression of genes regulated by Pho4, the C. albicans transcription factor that responds to low phosphate which we confirmed by showing the adh1 {Delta}/{Delta} strain had elevated Pho4-dependent phosphatase activity. The dual-dependence on ethanol and phosphate concentrations for anti-fungal production highlights how environmental factors modulate microbial interactions and dictate antagonisms such as those between P. aeruginosa and C. albicans.","NA"

Methods: Maximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses have been performed to estimate the most probable temporal and geographic origin of different phylogenetic clusters and the diffusion pathways of SARS-CoV-2. Results: Phylogenetic analyses of the first 28 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained from patients in Spain revealed that most of them are distributed in G and S clades (13 sequences in each) with the remaining two sequences branching in the V clade. Eleven of the Spanish viruses of the S clade and six of the G clade grouped in two different monophyletic clusters (S-Spain and G-Spain, respectively), with the S-Spain cluster also comprising 8 sequences from 6 other countries from Europe and the Americas. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated in the city of Wuhan, China, around November 24, 2019, with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval from October 30-December 17, 2019. The origin of S-Spain and G-Spain clusters were estimated in Spain around February 14 and 18, 2020, respectively, with a possible ancestry of S-Spain in Shanghai. Conclusions: Multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have been detected in Spain and at least two resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters, with further dissemination of one of them to at least 6 other countries.

Hartmann","Northwestern University","2020-04-20",1,"cc_by","new results","neuroscience","Nearly all mammals have a vibrissal system specialized for tactile sensation, composed of whiskers growing from sensor-rich follicles in the skin. Because a whisker has no sensors along its length, an open question is how mechanoreceptors in the follicle transduce sensory signals. These mechanoreceptors are activated by whisker deflection, so it is essential to understand how the whisker deforms within the follicle and so how it may activate different populations of mechanoreceptors in different ways. During active whisking behaviors, muscle contractions and increases in blood pressure in the ring sinus will likely affect the whisker deformation profile. Directly recording from mechanoreceptors under these conditions is difficult due to their small size, location within intricate and delicate membranes, and movement during sensation. Using data from a previous experimental study on whisker deflection, and from histological analysis of follicle tissue, we develop a mechanical model of the follicle sinus complex. With this model we first simulate passive whisker contact, replicating previous results of ex vivo experiments on deformation of a whisker within the follicle. We then simulate whisker deformation within the follicle during active whisking. Results of these simulations predict that both intrinsic muscle contraction and elevated hydrostatic pressure within the ring sinus may be regulatory mechanisms to enhance tactile sensitivity during active whisking. The mechanical model presented in this study is an important first step in simulating mechanical interactions within whisker follicles, and aids in the development of artificial robotic follicles.","NA"

However, they also exhibit difficulties in several other cognitive domains, including visuospatial processing, executive functioning and attention. One account of the difficulties seen in DCD proposes an impairment in internal forward modelling, i.e., the ability to (i) detect regularities of a repetitive perceptual or motor pattern, (ii) ;predict future outcomes of motor actions, and (iii) adapt behaviour accordingly. Using electroencephalographic recordings, the present study aimed to delineate these different aspects of internal forward modelling across several domains. To this end, 24 children with DCD and 23 typically-developing children (aged 7-10 years) completed a serial prediction task in the visual, temporal, spatial and motor domains. This task required them to learn short sequences and to indicate whether a sequence was disrupted towards its end. Analyses revealed that, across all domains, children with DCD showed poorer discrimination between intact and disrupted sequences, accompanied by a delayed late parietal positivity elicited by disrupted sequences. These results indicate an impairment in explicit sequence discrimination in DCD across motor and cognitive domains. However, there is no evidence for an impairment in implicit performance on the motor task in DCD. These results suggest an impairment of the updating of an internal forward model in DCD resulting in a blurred representation of that model and consequently in a reduced ability to detect regularities in the environment (e.g., sequences). Such a detailed understanding of internal forward modelling in DCD could help to explain the wide range of co-occurring difficulties experienced by those with a diagnosis of DCD.","NA"

In this publication we characterize the regional distribution of prostatic cell types in the young intact dog to enable comparisons with human and mice and we examine how the cellular source of procollagen 1A1 changes with age in intact male dogs. Methods: A multichotomous decision tree involving sequential immunohistochemical stains was validated for use in dog and used to identify specific prostatic cell types and determine their distribution in the capsule, peripheral, periurethral and urethral regions of the young intact canine prostate. Prostatic cells identified using this technique include perivascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes, endothelial cells, luminal, intermediate, and basal epithelial cells, neuroendocrine cells, myofibroblasts, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, and other hematolymphoid cells. Corresponding images were made freely accessible through the GUDMAP database at https://doi.org/10.25548/16-WMM4. Results: The prostatic peripheral region harbors the largest proportion of epithelial cells. Aging does not change the density of hematolymphoid cells, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts in the peripheral region or in the fibromuscular capsule, regions where we previously observed aging- and androgen-mediated increases in prostatic collagen abundance Instead, we observed aging-related changes the procollagen 1A1 positive prostatic cell identity from a myofibroblast to a fibroblast. Conclusions: Hematolymphoid cells and myofibroblasts are often identified as sources of collagen in tissues prone to aging-related fibrosis. We show that these are not the likely sources of pathological collagen synthesis in older intact male dogs. Instead, we identify an aging-related shift in the prostatic cell type producing procollagen 1A1 that will help direct development of cell type and prostate appropriate therapeutics for collagen accumulation.","NA"

NRN stimulates antioxidant enzymes and also improves glucose uptake. Hence this study was designed to look for therapeutic effects of NRN and in comparison, to metformin (MET) on inflammation-mediated increased NO and decreased antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) in diabetic rat model with compromised glycemic and lipid profile. After single intraperitoneal injection of alloxan (120 mg/kg), the rats were equally divided as Group 1 and 2 which received normal saline and no-treatment respectively while group 3 and 4 received MET 50 mg/kg/day and NRN 50 mg/kg/day respectively.

Results showed that alloxan significantly increased serum level of glucose (P<0.001), NO (P<0.001) and inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-, IL-6), however, it expressively decreased serum SOD and insulin level. While, NRN significantly downregulated glucose (P<0.05), lipid profile, TNF-, IL-6 and normalized level of NO (P<0.01). It also improved SOD level as compared to that of MET-treatment.

Several reports have been published on the efficacy of non-watertight sutures in duraplasty performed in decompressive craniectomy. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of dura closure without sutures (non-suture duraplasty) in decompressive craniectomy for TBI. Methods One hundred and six patients were enrolled at a single trauma center between January 2017 and December 2018. We retrospectively collected the data and classified the patients into non-suture and suture duraplasty craniectomy groups. We compared the characteristics of patients and their intra/post-operative findings such as operative time, blood loss, imaging findings, complications, and Glasgow outcome scale. Results There were 37 patients in the non-suture group and 69 in the suture craniectomy group. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to general characteristics. The operative time was 205 min for the suture duraplasty group and 150 min for the non-suture duraplasty group, and that for the non-suture duraplasty group was significantly lesser (p=0.002). Blood loss was significantly lesser in the non-suture duraplasty group (1000 mL) than in the suture duraplasty group (1500 mL, p=0.028). There were no other significant differences. Conclusion Non-suture duraplasty involved shorter operative time and lesser blood loss when compared to suture duraplasty. Other complications and prognosis were similar in both groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that decompressive craniectomy with non-suture duraplasty is a safe and useful surgical technique in patients with TBI.","NA"

We recovered a hypothetical gene YLR053c, renamed NSR1 for Nitrogen-responsive Start Regulator 1, which encodes a poorly characterized 108 amino acid microprotein. Endogenous Nsr1 was nuclear-localized, restricted to poor nitrogen conditions, induced upon mTORC1 inhibition, and cell cycle-regulated with a peak at Start. NSR1 interacted genetically with SWI4 and SWI6, which encode the master G1/S transcription factor complex SBF. Correspondingly, Nsr1 physically interacted with Swi4 and Swi6 and was localized to G1/S promoter DNA.

Results: The designed vaccine construct has several immunodominant epitopes from structural proteins of Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope. These peptides promote cellular and humoral immunity and Interferon gamma responses. In addition, these epitopes have antigenicity ability and no allergenicity probability. To enhance the vaccine immunogenicity, we used three potent adjuvants; Flagellin, a driven peptide from high mobility group box 1 as HP-91 and human beta defensin 3 protein. The physicochemical and immunological properties of the vaccine structure were evaluated. Tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and refined by I-Tasser and galaxi refine and validated using Rampage and ERRAT. Results of Ellipro showed 242 residues from vaccine might be conformational B cell epitopes. Docking of vaccine with Toll-Like Receptors 3, 5 and 8 proved an appropriate interaction between the vaccine and receptor proteins. In silico cloning demonstrated that the vaccine can be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli.

HOXA9 overexpression not only predicts poor diagnosis and outcome but also plays a critical role in leukemia transformation and maintenance. However, our current understanding of HOXA9 regulation in leukemia is limited, hindering development of therapeutic strategies to treat HOXA9-driven leukemia. To mitigate these challenges, we generated the first HOXA9-mCherry knock-in reporter in an MLL-rearranged (MLLr) B-ALL cell line to dissect HOXA9 regulation. By utilizing the reporter and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated screens, we identified transcription factors controlling HOXA9 expression, including a novel regulator, USF2 and its homolog USF1. USF1/USF2 depletion significantly down-regulated HOXA9 expression and impaired MLLr leukemia cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of HOXA9-MEIS1 fusion protein rescued the impaired leukemia cell proliferation upon USF2 loss. Cut&Run analysis revealed the direct occupancy of USF2 onto HOXA9 promoter in MLLr leukemia cells. Collectively, the HOXA9 reporter facilitated the functional interrogation of the HOXA9 regulome and has advanced our understanding of the molecular regulation network in HOXA9-driven leukemia.","NA"

They assemble fibronectin nanofibrils using IIb{beta}3 (CD41/CD61, GPIIb-IIIa) rather than 5{beta}1 integrins, in contrast to fibroblasts. Highly contractile platelets in contact with thrombus proteins (fibronectin, fibrin) pull fibronectin fibrils along their apical membrane, whereas platelets on basement membrane proteins (collagen IV, laminin) are less contractile generating less stretched planar meshworks beneath themselves. As probed by vinculin-decorated talin unfolding, platelets on fibronectin generate similar traction forces in apical fibrillar adhesions as fibroblasts do. These are novel mechanobiology mechanisms by which platelets spearhead the fibrillogenesis of the first de novo ECM, including its 2D versus 3D network architectures depending on their ECM environment, and thereby pave the way for cell infiltration.","NA"

Opportunistic human pathogens in particular typically exhibit high levels of intrinsic antibiotic resistance and tolerance1, leading to chronic infections that can be nearly impossible to eradicate2. We asked whether the recalcitrance of these organisms to antibiotic treatment could be driven in part by their evolutionary history as environmental microbes, which frequently produce or encounter natural antibiotics3,4. Using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model, we demonstrate that the self-produced natural antibiotic pyocyanin (PYO) activates bacterial defenses that confer collateral tolerance to certain synthetic antibiotics, including in a clinically-relevant growth medium. Non-PYO-producing opportunistic pathogens isolated from lung infections similarly display increased antibiotic tolerance when they are co-cultured with PYO-producing P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, we show that beyond promoting bacterial survival in the presence of antibiotics, PYO can increase the apparent rate of mutation to antibiotic resistance by up to two orders of magnitude. Our work thus suggests that bacterial production of natural antibiotics in infections could play an important role in modulating not only the immediate efficacy of clinical antibiotics, but also the rate at which antibiotic resistance arises in multispecies bacterial communities.","NA"

All heifers received the same diet composed of corn silage, soybean meal, corn meal, minerals and vitamins, with a corn silage:concentrate ratio of 50:50 (on a dry matter basis), aiming an average daily gain of approximately 1.0 kg. The sampling periods were established according to the days of gestation: 145, 200, and 255 with a duration of 10 days per period. Total fecal samples were collected to estimate dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber digestibility. Blood samples were collected to analyze metabolites (non-esterified fatty acids, {beta}-hydroxybutyrate, urea, and glucose). Data were analyzed as a repeated measurements scheme, using MIXED procedure, with differences declared when P < 0.05. Dry matter intake expressed in kg/day increased from d-145 to d-200, and remaining stable until d-255 of gestation. The same results were observed for organic matter and crude protein intake, increasing 15.0 and 35.8% respectively. In contrast, when dry matter intake was evaluated as % body weight, we observed a decrease of 16.7% from d-200 to d-255. Days of gestation did not influence ruminal flow of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber. We observed an increase in the ruminal digestibility of neutral detergent fiber by 20.5%. The apparent total-tract digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein changed over days of gestation, with an increase of 11.9, 8.5, and 9.8%, respectively, when comparing d-145 with d-200. The rate of digestion of neutral detergent fiber increased from 2.0 to 3.5% h -1 . Glucose levels decreased, while {beta}-hydroxybutirate and non-esterified fatty acids increased from d-145 to d-255. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a reduction in dry matter intake in % body weight due to pregnancy. It also shows an increase in total apparent digestibility through gestation, which imply a greater efficiency of use of nutrients by pregnant animals. Thus, further research is still needed to consolidate such results and to elucidate the mechanism about nutrient usage during the final third of gestation in heifers.","NA"

ESCRT-III polymerisation at the nuclear envelope occurs transiently during mitotic exit and CHMP7, an ER-localised ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein, initiates assembly in a manner dependent upon the INM protein LEM2. Whilst classical nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanisms have been proposed to separate LEM2 and CHMP7 during interphase, it is unclear how CHMP7 assembly is suppressed in mitosis when NE and ER identities are mixed. Here, we use live cell imaging and protein biochemistry to examine the biology of these proteins during mitotic exit. We show that CHMP7 plays an important role in disaggregating LEM2 clusters at the reforming nuclear envelope during mitotic exit to allow proper nuclear regeneration. Further, we show that CDK1 phosphorylates CHMP7 upon mitotic entry and suppresses its polymerisation, preventing its inappropriate capture of LEM2 in the peripheral ER during mitotic exit. Lastly, we establish that a microtubule network is dispensable for ESCRT-III assembly at the reforming nuclear envelope. These data identify a key cell-cycle control programme allowing ESCRT-III-dependent nuclear regeneration.","NA"

We found that the three splice sites (donor, acceptor, and branching point) differ in how deviations from the consensus sequence affect functionality.

In migrating epithelial sheets, leader cells form lamellipodia to advance, and follower cells also form similar motile apparatus at cell-cell boundaries, which are called cryptic lamellipodia (c-lamellipodia). Using adenocarcinoma-derived epithelial cells, we investigated how c-lamellipodia are generated, and found that they sporadically grew from E-cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs). WAVE and Arp2/3 complexes were localized along the AJs, and silencing them not only interfered with c-lamellipodia formation but also prevented follower cells from trailing the leaders. Disruption of AJs by removing E-catenin resulted in uncontrolled c-lamellipodia growth, and this was brought about by myosin II activation and the resultant contraction of AJ-associated actomyosin cables. Additional observations indicated that c-lamellipodia tended to grow at mechanically weak sites of the junction. We conclude that AJs not only tie cells together but also generate c-lamellipodia by recruiting actin regulators, enabling epithelial cells to undergo ordered collective migration.","NA"

Additionally, in multiparous species, embryos face a unique challenge of achieving adequate spacing to avoid competition for maternal resources. Using our enhanced confocal imaging and 3D image reconstruction technology, we evaluate murine embryo location in the uterus along the longitudinal oviductal-cervical axis. Our analysis reveals three distinct pre-implantation stages: a) Embryo entry; b) Unidirectional movement of embryo clusters; and c) Bidirectional scattering and spacing of embryos. We show that unidirectional movement of embryo clusters is facilitated by a mechanical stimulus of the embryo as a physical object and is regulated by adrenergic uterine smooth muscle contractions. Embryo scattering, on the other hand, relies on embryo-uterine communication reliant on the LPAR3 signaling pathway and is independent of adrenergic muscle contractions. We propose that the presence of embryo clusters in the uterine horn provides an opportunity for the uterus to sense and count the embryos, followed by scattering and spacing these embryos along the given length of the horn. Thus, uterine implantation sites in mice are neither random nor predetermined but are guided by the number of embryos entering the uterine lumen. These studies have implications for understanding how embryo-uterine communication is key to determining an optimal implantation site, which is necessary for the success of a pregnancy.","NA"

Another boost potential could be applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system in a dual-boost algorithm (LiGaMD_Dual) to facilitate ligand binding. LiGaMD has been demonstrated on host-guest and protein-ligand binding model systems. Repetitive guest binding and unbinding in the {beta}-cyclodextrin host were observed in hundreds-of-nanosecond LiGaMD simulations. The calculated binding free energies of guest molecules with sufficient sampling agreed excellently with experimental data (< 1.0 kcal/mol error). In comparison with previous microsecond-timescale conventional molecular dynamics simulations, accelerations of ligand kinetic rate constants in LiGaMD simulations were properly estimated using Kramers' rate theory. Furthermore, LiGaMD allowed us to capture repetitive dissociation and binding of the benzamidine inhibitor in trypsin within 1 s simulations.

These are postulated to be single-stranded in order to be functional, yet knowledge of secondary structural features that regulate the exposure of exonic splicing motifs across the transcriptome is not currently available. Using transcriptome-wide RNA structural information we show that retained introns in mouse are commonly flanked by a short ([lsim]70 nucleotide), highly base-paired segment upstream and a predominantly single-stranded exonic segment downstream. Splicing assays with select pre-mRNA substrates demonstrate that loops immediately upstream of the introns contain pre-mRNA-specific splicing enhancers, the substitution or hybridization of which impedes splicing. Additionally, the exonic segments flanking the retained introns appeared to be more enriched in a previously identified set of hexameric exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) sequences compared to their spliced counterparts, suggesting that base-pairing in the exonic segments upstream of retained introns could be a means for occlusion of ESEs. The upstream exonic loops of the test substrate promoted recruitment of splicing factors and consequent pre-mRNA structural remodeling, leading up to assembly of the early spliceosome. These results suggest that disruption of exonic stem-loop structures immediately upstream (but not downstream) of the introns regulate alternative splicing events, likely through modulating accessibility of splicing factors.","NA"

Despite decades of documented use, the lack of standardization in data reporting has resulted in a growing body of literature that cannot be easily interpreted, validated, or reproduced. This has made it difficult for objective assessments of both assays and instruments, in-turn leading to significant hindrances in scientific progress, specifically in the study of EVs, where the phenotypic analysis of these submicron-sized vesicles is becoming common-place in every biomedical field. Methods for fluorescence and light scatter standardization are well established and the reagents to perform these analyses are commercially available. However, fluorescence and light scatter calibration are not widely adopted by the small particle community as methods to standardize flow cytometry data. In this proof-of-concept study carried out as a resource for use at the CYTO2019 workshop, we demonstrate for the first-time simultaneous fluorescence and light scatter calibration of small particle data to show the ease and feasibility of this method for standardized flow cytometry data reporting. This data was acquired using standard configuration commercial flow cytometers, with commercially available materials, published methods, and freely available software tools. We show that application of light scatter, fluorescence, and concentration calibration can result in highly concordant data between flow cytometry platforms independent of instrument collection angle, gain/voltage settings, and flow rate; thus, providing a means of cross-comparison in standard units.","NA"

It is not quite known yet how their quite diverse phenotypes are shaped by the functions that they assume in each tissue. In this study, we elucidate a functional link between the Slc7a7 cationic amino acid transporter and tissue macrophages. We had identified a mutant zebrafish devoid of microglia due to a mutation in the slc7a7 gene. We found that in Slc7a7 deficient larvae, macrophages do enter the retina and brain to become microglia, but then die during the developmental wave of neuronal apoptosis, which triggers intense efferocytic work from them. A similar macrophage demise occurs at other tissues and stages whereby macrophages have to engulf many cell corpses, be it due to developmental or experimentally triggered cell death. We found that slc7a7 is by far the main cationic amino acid transporter gene expressed in macrophages of wild type zebrafish larvae, and that its expression is induced in tissue macrophages within 1-2 hrs upon efferocytosis. Our data altogether indicate that a high level of Slc7a7 is vital not only for microglia but also for any steadily efferocytic tissue macrophages, and that slc7a7 gene induction is one of the adaptive responses that allow them to cope with the catabolism of numerous dead cells without compromising their own viability.","NA"

TIB has been extended to a wide array of fragmented ecosystems, beyond archipelagoes, surfing on the analogy between habitat patches and islands and the patch-matrix framework. However, patch connectivity often little contributes to explaining species richness in empirical studies. Before interpreting this trend as questioning the broad applicability of TIB principles, one first needs a clear identification of methods and contexts where strong effects of patch structural connectivity are likely to occur. Here, we use spatially explicit simulations of neutral metacommunities to show that patch connectivity effect on local species richness is maximized under a set of specific conditions: (i) patch delineation should be fine enough to ensure that no dispersal limitation occurs within patches, (ii) patch connectivity indices should be scaled according to target organisms' dispersal distance and (iii) the habitat amount around sampled sites (within a distance adapted to organisms' dispersal) should be highly variable. When those three criteria are met, the absence of effect of connectivity on species richness should be interpreted as contradicting TIB predictions.","NA"

Pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales, including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts. We analyze a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission between individuals. Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections. Our results provide a framework to advance the integration of laboratory, clinical and field data in the context of evolutionary theory, laying the foundation for a new generation of evidence-based risk assessment of emergence threats.","NA"

We characterize several enhancer viruses in detail to show that they result in labeling of different projection neuron subclasses in mouse cortex, and that one of them can be used to label the homologous projection neuron subclass in human cortical slices. To enable the combinatorial labeling of more than one cell type by enhancer viruses, we developed a three-color Cre-, Flp- and Nigri- recombinase dependent reporter mouse line, Ai213. The delivery of three enhancer viruses driving these recombinases via a single retroorbital injection into a single Ai213 transgenic mouse results in labeling of three different neuronal classes/subclasses in the same brain tissue.

Though both perception and metacognition tended to be biased towards previous responses, we observed novel dissociations which challenge normative theories of confidence. Different evidence levels often informed perceptual and metacognitive decisions within observers, and response history distinctly influenced 1st (perceptual) and 2nd (metacognitive) order decision-parameters, with the metacognitive bias likely to be strongest and most prevalent in the general population.

Major controversy concerns the question whether cortical plasticity related to word learning occurs in neocortical speech-related areas immediately after learning, or neocortical plasticity emerges only on the second day after a prolonged time required for consolidation after learning. The functional spatiotemporal pattern of cortical activity related to such learning also remains largely unknown. In order to address these questions, we examined magnetoencephalographic responses elicited in the cerebral cortex by passive presentations of eight novel pseudowords before and immediately after an operant conditioning task. This associative procedure forced participants to perform an active search for unique meaning of four pseudowords that referred to movements of left and right hands and feet. The other four pseudowords did not require any movement and thus were not associated with any meaning. Familiarization with novel pseudowords led to a bilateral repetition suppression of cortical responses to them; the effect started before or around the uniqueness point and lasted for more than 500 ms. After learning, response amplitude to pseudowords that acquired meaning was greater compared with response amplitude to pseudowords that were not assigned meaning; the effect was significant within 144-362 ms after the uniqueness point, and it was found only in the left hemisphere. Within this time interval, a learning-related selective response initially emerged in cortical areas surrounding the Sylvian fissure: anterior superior temporal sulcus, ventral premotor cortex, the anterior part of intraparietal sulcus and insula. Later within this interval, activation additionally spread to more anterior higher-tier brain regions, and reached the left temporal pole and the triangular part of the left inferior frontal gyrus extending to its orbital part. Altogether, current findings evidence rapid plastic changes in cortical representations of meaningful auditory word-forms occurring almost immediately after learning. Additionally, our results suggest that familiarization resulting from stimulus repetition and semantic acquisition resulting from an active learning procedure have separable effects on cortical activity.","NA"

Inflammation is observed in AD and is related to aging, stress and neuroplasticity, and aging biomarkers also include changes in DNA methylation patterns which have been used to determine epigenetic age. Although studies are scarce, sex differences are noted in inflammation and in epigenetic aging. We investigated using the ADNI database the effect of sex and APOE genotype (non-carriers or carriers of 1 or 2 APOE{epsilon}4 alleles) and sex and diagnosis (cognitively normal (CN), MCI, AD) on CSF and plasma markers of stress and inflammation, and blood epigenetic age. We found sex and APOE genotype interactions on CSF levels of IL-8 and IL-16 cytokines suggesting that the presence of APOE{epsilon}4 alleles differentially affects male and female physiology. Furthermore, females had higher levels of plasma CRP and ICAM1 but lower levels of CSF ICAM1, IL-8, IL-16, and IgA than males, showing in part that results may differ by sample source (plasma and CSF). Carrying 1 or 2 of APOE{epsilon}4 alleles and diagnosis (MCI and AD) decreased plasma CRP in both sexes. Neither sex, diagnosis, nor presence of APOE{epsilon}4 alleles affected epigenetic age acceleration. Sex differences in inflammatory biomarkers support that the underlying physiological changes during aging differ by sex and tissue origin.","NA"

The results were replicated in three independent longitudinal datasets. We found that inter-regional profiles of cortical thinning related to expression profiles for marker genes of CA1 pyramidal cells, astrocytes and microglia during development and in aging. During the two stages of life, the relationships went in opposite directions: greater gene expression related to less thinning in development and vice versa in aging. The association between cortical thinning and cell-specific gene expression was also present in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease. These findings suggest a role of astrocytes and microglia in promoting and supporting neuronal growth and dendritic structures through life that affects cortical thickness during development, aging, and neurodegeneration.

Predicting these changes are challenging because it involves some unknown clinical risk factors that leads to a non-deterministic prediction task. In this study, we propose a deep learning model to predict the evolution of WMH from baseline to follow-up (i.e., 1-year later), namely ``Disease Evolution Predictor"" (DEP) model, which can be adjusted to become a non-deterministic model. The DEP model receives a baseline image as input and produces a map called ``Disease Evolution Map"" (DEM), which represents the evolution of WMH from baseline to follow-up. Two DEP models are proposed, namely DEP-UResNet and DEP-GAN, which are representatives of the supervised (i.e., need expert-generated manual labels to generate the output) and unsupervised (i.e., do not require manual labels produced by experts) deep learning algorithms respectively. To simulate the non-deterministic and unknown parameters involved in WMH evolution, we modulate a Gaussian noise array to the DEP model as auxiliary input. This forces the DEP model to imitate a wider spectrum of alternatives in the prediction results. The alternatives of using other types of auxiliary input instead, such as baseline WMH and stroke lesion loads are also proposed and tested. Based on our experiments, the fully supervised machine learning scheme DEP-UResNet regularly performed better than the DEP-GAN which works in principle without using any expert-generated label (i.e., unsupervised). However, a semi-supervised DEP-GAN model, which uses probability maps produced by a supervised segmentation method in the learning process, yielded similar performances to the DEP-UResNet and performed best in the clinical evaluation. Furthermore, an ablation study showed that an auxiliary input, especially the Gaussian noise, improved the performance of DEP models compared to DEP models that lacked the auxiliary input regardless of the model's architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive study on modelling WMH evolution using deep learning algorithms, which deals with the non-deterministic nature of WMH evolution.","NA"

In the skin epidermis, melanocytes react to certain environmental signals with melanin production and release, thereby ensuring photo-protection. For this, melanocytes acquire a highly polarized and dendritic architecture that facilitates interactions with surrounding keratinocytes and melanin transfer. How the morphology and function of these neural crest-derived cells is regulated remains poorly understood. Here, using mouse genetics and primary cell cultures, we show that conserved proteins of the mammalian Par3-aPKC polarity complex are required for epidermal pigmentation. Melanocyte-specific deletion of Par3 in mice caused skin hypopigmentation, reduced expression of components of the melanin synthesis pathway, and altered dendritic morphology. Mechanistically, Par3 was necessary downstream of -melanocyte stimulating hormone (-MSH) to elicit melanin production. Strikingly, pharmacologic activation of MITF using a salt-inducible kinase inhibitor was sufficient to restore melanocyte differentiation and skin pigmentation in the absence of Par3.

The evidence supporting this conclusion comes from both observational and experimental research, with 'space-for-time' substitution surveys of pollutant gradients a significant portion of the former. However, estimates of regression coefficients for Ndep impacts on species richness, derived with a focus on causal inference, are hard to locate in the observational literature. Some influential observational studies have presented estimates from univariate models, overlooking the effects of omitted variable bias, and/or have used P-value-based stepwise variable selection (PSVS) to infer impacts, a strategy known to be poorly suited to the accurate estimation of regression coefficients. Broad-scale spatial autocorrelation has also generally been unaccounted for. We re-examine two UK observational datasets that have previously been used to investigate the relationship between Ndep and plant species richness in acid grasslands, a much-researched habitat in this context. One of these studies (Stevens et al. 2004, Science, 303:1876-1879) estimated a large negative impact of Ndep on richness through the use of PSVS; the other reported smaller impacts (Maskell et al. 2010, Glob. Change Biol., 16:671-679), but did not explicitly report regression coefficients or partial effects, making the actual size of the estimated Ndep impact difficult to assess. We reanalyse both datasets using a spatial Bayesian linear model estimated using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). Contrary to previous results, we found similar-sized estimates of the Ndep impact on plant richness between studies, both with and without bryophytes, albeit with some disagreement over the most likely direction of this effect. Our analyses suggest that some previous estimates of Ndep impacts on richness from space-for-time substitution studies are likely to have been over-estimated, and that the evidence from observational studies could be fragile when confronted with alternative model specifications, although further work is required to investigate potentially nonlinear responses. Given the growing literature on the use of observational data to estimate the impacts of pollutants on biodiversity, we suggest that a greater focus on clearly reporting important outcomes with associated uncertainty, the use of techniques to account for spatial autocorrelation, and a clearer focus on the aims of a study, whether explanatory or predictive, are all required.","NA"

We used whole cell electrophysiology in acute rat midbrain slices to investigate synaptic actions of N/OFQ. N/OFQ was primarily inhibitory, causing outward currents in both immunocytochemically identified dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH(+)) and non-dopaminergic (TH(-)) VTA neurons (effect at 1 {micro}M: 20 {+/-} 4 pA). Surprisingly, this effect was mediated by augmentation of postsynaptic GABAAR currents, unlike the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), where the N/OFQ induced outward currents were K+ channel dependent. A smaller population, 19% of all VTA neurons, responded to low concentrations N/OFQ with inward currents (10 nM: -11 {+/-} 2 pA). Following 100 nM N/OFQ, the response to a second N/OFQ application was markedly diminished in VTA neurons (14 {+/-} 10% of first response), but not in SNc neurons (90 {+/-} 20% of first response). N/OFQ generated outward currents in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-projecting VTA neurons, but inward currents in a subset of posterior anterior cingulate cortex-projecting VTA neurons. While N/OFQ inhibited NAc-projecting VTA cell bodies, it had little effect on electrically or optogenetically evoked terminal dopamine release in the NAc measured ex vivo with fast scan cyclic voltammetry.

Besides functioning as an antiviral effector, IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a negative regulator of IFN signalling and inherited ISG15-deficiency leads to autoinflammatory interferonopathies where individuals exhibit elevated ISG expression in the absence of pathogenic infection. We have recapitulated these effects in cultured human A549-ISG15-/- cells and (using A549-UBA7-/- cells) confirmed that posttranslational modification by ISG15 (ISGylation) is not required for regulation of the type-I IFN response. ISG15-deficient cells pre-treated with IFN-alpha; were resistant to paramyxovirus infection. We also showed that IFN-alpha; treatment of ISG15-deficient cells led to significant inhibition of global protein synthesis leading us to ask whether resistance was due to the direct antiviral activity of ISGs or whether cells were non-permissive due to translation defects. We took advantage of the knowledge that IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) is the principal antiviral ISG for parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5). Knockdown of IFIT1 restored PIV5 infection in IFN-alpha;-pre-treated ISG15-deficient cells, confirming that resistance was due to the direct antiviral activity of the IFN response. However, resistance could be induced if cells were pre-treated with IFN-alpha; for longer times, presumably due to inhibition of protein synthesis. These data show that the cause of virus resistance is two-fold; ISG15-deficiency leads to the early over-expression of specific antiviral ISGs, but the later response is dominated by an unanticipated, ISG15-dependent, loss of translational control.","NA"

Identification of cardiac fibroblast-specific factors and mechanisms underlying these aspects of cardiac fibroblast function is therefore of considerable scientific and clinical interest. In the present study, gene knockdown and over-expression approaches, and promoter binding assays, showed that DDR2, a mesenchymal cell-specific collagen receptor tyrosine kinase localized predominantly in fibroblasts in the heart, acts via ERK1/2 MAPK-activated SRF transcription factor to enhance the expression of anti-apoptotic cIAP2 in cardiac fibroblasts, conferring resistance against oxidative injury. Further, DDR2 was found to act via ERK1/2 MAPK-activated SRF to transcriptionally up-regulate Skp2 that in turn facilitated post-translational degradation of p27, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that causes cell cycle arrest, to promote G1-S transition, as evidenced by Rb phosphorylation, increased PCNA levels and flow cytometry. DDR2-dependent ERK1/2 MAPK activation also suppressed FoxO3a-mediated transcriptional induction of p27. Inhibition of the binding of collagen type I to DDR2 using WRG-28 indicated the obligate role of collagen type I in the activation of DDR2 and its regulatory role in cell survival and cell cycle protein expression. Notably, DDR2 levels positively correlated with SRF, cIAP2 and PCNA levels in cardiac fibroblasts from Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats. To conclude, DDR2-mediated ERK1/2MAPK activation facilitates coordinated regulation of cell survival and cell cycle progression in cardiac fibroblasts via SRF.","NA"

TEs are prevented from causing damage to the host genome by defense mechanisms such as nuclear silencing, where TE transcripts are targeted for degradation in an RNAi-like fashion. These pathways are well characterised in model organisms but very little is known about them in other species. Parasitic flatworms present an opportunity to investigate evolutionary novelties in TE control because they lack canonical pathways identified in model organisms (such as the piRNA pathways) but have conserved central players such as Dicer and Ago (argonaute) enzymes. Notably, parasitic flatworm Agos are phylogenetically distinct from classical Agos, raising the question of whether they play special roles in these organisms. In this report, we investigate the role of Ago proteins in the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. We show that transcript abundance of two retrotransposable elements increases upon silencing of S.mansoni Ago genes. We further demonstrate that SmAgo2 protein is primarily localised in the germ line of adult worms and its sub-cellular localisation is both nuclear and cytoplasmic.

In the scanner, participants viewed a trial-unique item, and after a distractor task, visually imagined the initial item. During encoding, we observed decodable information at all levels of granularity in category-selective visual cortex, while during recall, only stimulus class was decodable. A closer look revealed a segregation between those voxels showing the strongest effects during encoding and those during visual recall. Finally, in a whole-brain analysis, we find peaks of encoding-recall similarity in regions anterior to category-selective cortex. Collectively, these results suggest visual recall is not merely a reactivation of encoding patterns, displaying a different granularity of information and localization from encoding, despite some overlap.","NA"

One of these, homeostatic structural plasticity, has been reported to restore activity in networks disrupted by peripheral lesions by altering their neuronal connectivity. While multiple lesion experiments have studied the changes in neurite morphology that underlie modifications of synapses in these networks, the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes are yet to be explained. Evidence suggests that neuronal activity modulates neurite morphology and may stimulate neurites to selective sprout or retract to restore network activity levels. We developed a new spiking network model, simulations of which accurately reproduce network rewiring after peripheral lesions as reported in experiments, to study these activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we deafferent a biologically realistic network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex. Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed model of homeostatic structural plasticity and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network are both necessary for successful rewiring of the network.","NA"

Here, we conducted a large-scale online study of aphantasics and revealed a dissociation in object and spatial content in their memory representations.

Drawings were objectively quantified by 2,795 online scorers for object and spatial details. Aphantasics recalled significantly fewer objects than controls, with less color in their drawings, and an increased reliance on verbal scaffolding. However, aphantasics showed incredibly high spatial accuracy, equivalent to controls, and made significantly fewer memory errors. These differences between groups only manifested during recall, with no differences between groups during the matched perceptual condition. This object-specific memory impairment in aphantasics provides evidence for separate systems in memory that support object versus spatial information.","NA"

One participant group listened to the stimulation while EEG was recorded (Experiment I). A second group performed a behavioral amplitude-modulation detection task (Experiment II). Neural activity depended on sound-level statistical context in two different ways. Consistent with an account positing that the sensitivity of neurons to sound intensity adapts to ambient sound level, responses for higher-intensity bursts were larger in low-mode than high-mode contexts, whereas responses for lower-intensity bursts did not differ between contexts. In contrast, a concurrent slow neural response indicated prediction-error processing: The response was larger for bursts at intensities that deviated from the predicted statistical context compared to those not deviating. Behavioral responses were consistent with prediction-error processing, but not with neural adaptation. Hence, neural activity adapts to sound-level statistics, but fine-tuning of perceptual sensitivity appears to involve neural prediction-error responses.","NA"

Pruning wounds were left unprotected physically and chemically during two periods of three months each, from November to February and from February to May. The diversity and composition of the fungal microbiome that colonized the pruning wounds was identified by ITS2 high-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS). A broad range of fungi was able to colonize grapevine pruning wounds at both infection periods. Fungal microbiome composition did not shift as year of sampling. Fungal communities were affected in their diversity and composition by the D.O., whereas the spatial variation (i.e. vineyard within each region) was low. Pruned canes harboured a core community of fungal species, which appeared to be independent of the infection period. Accumulated rainfall over 8 and 11 weeks after pruning positively correlated with the total fungal microbiome and in particular with the GTD fungal genus Diaporthe abundances. A strong seasonal effect on GTD fungal infection was detected for most genera, with higher percentages of abundance detected after pruning in February (winter) as compared with that of pruning in November (mid-autumn). In light of the GTD colonization results and given the environmental conditions and the geographical location of this study, early pruning is recommended to reduce the infections caused by GTD fungi during the pruning season in Galicia.","NA"

Here, we study Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a combination of mutational experiments, bioinformatics, and evolutionary analyses, and show that many different pairs of amino acids and their associated tRNA molecules predictably and causally encode translation rate information when these pairs are present in the A- and P-sites of the ribosome independent of other factors known to influence translation speed, including mRNA structure, wobble base pairing, tripeptide motifs, positively charged upstream nascent chain residues, and cognate tRNA concentration. The fast-translating pairs of amino acids that we identify are enriched seven-fold relative to the slow-translating pairs across Saccharomyces cerevisiae's proteome, while the slow-translating pairs are enriched downstream of domain boundaries. Thus, the chemical identity of amino acid pairs contributes to variability in translation rates, elongation kinetics are causally encoded in the primary structure of proteins, and signatures of evolutionary selection indicate their potential role in co-translational processes.","NA"

While it is generally accepted that there exist several biological mechanisms that may define distinct schizophrenia subtypes, they have not been identified yet. We applied comprehensive gene expression analysis, searching for molecular signals that differentiate patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls, and examined whether the identified signal characterizes a particular subgroup of the patients. METHODS: We performed transcriptome sequencing of 14 superior temporal gyrus (STG) samples of relatively young (mean age: 44) subjects with schizophrenia and 15 matched controls from the Stanley Medical Research Institute. Analyses of differential expression and pathway enrichment were applied and the results were compared with those obtained from an independent cohort of elderly (mean age: 74) patients. Replicability was then tested on six additional independent datasets of various brain regions. RESULTS: The two STG cohorts of relatively young and elderly subjects showed high replicability. Pathway enrichment analysis of the down-regulated genes pointed to proteasome-related pathways. Meta-analysis of differential expression identified down-regulation of 12 of 39 proteasome subunits in schizophrenia. Down-regulation of multiple proteasome subunits was replicated in six additional datasets (overall 8 cohorts, with 267 schizophrenia and 266 control samples, from 5 brain regions, were studied). This signal was concentrated in a subgroup of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: We detect global down-regulation of proteasome subunits in a subgroup of the patients with schizophrenia. The proteasome is a major intracellular protein degradation system, where ubiquitinated proteins (proteins bound by the small protein called ubiquitin) are targeted for degradation. We hypothesize that the down-regulation we detect leads to proteasome dysfunction that causes accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Such accumulation has recently been identified, also in a subgroup of the studied patients with schizophrenia. Thus, down-regulation of proteasome subunits might define a biological subtype of schizophrenia.","NA"

To investigate the biological roles of sterol C5-C6 desaturation, we generated a LSO-null mutant line (lso-) in Leishmania major, the causative agent for cutaneous leishmaniasis. Lso- parasites lacked the ergostane-based sterols commonly found in wild type L. major and instead accumulated equivalent sterol species without the C5-C6 double bond. These mutant parasites were replicative in culture and displayed heightened resistance to amphotericin B. However, they survived poorly after reaching the maximal density and were highly vulnerable to the membrane-disrupting detergent Triton X-100. In addition, lso- mutants showed defects in regulating intracellular pH and were hypersensitive to acidic conditions. They also had potential alteration in the carbohydrate composition of lipophosphoglycan, a membrane-bound virulence factor in Leishmania. All these defects in lso- were corrected upon the restoration of LSO expression. Together, these findings suggest that the C5-C6 double bond is vital for the structure of sterol core, and while the loss of LSO can lead to amphotericin B resistance, it also makes Leishmania parasites vulnerable to biologically relevant stress.","NA"

The commonly accepted theory of abiotic controls (mainly anoxia and low temperature) over carbon decomposition cannot explain how vast low-latitude wooded peatlands consistently accrete peat under warm and seasonally unsaturated conditions. Similarly, that theory cannot accurately project the decomposition rate in boreal peatlands where warming and drought have decreased Sphagnum and increased shrub expansion. Here, by comparing composition and ecological traits of microbes between Sphagnum- and shrub-dominated peatlands, we present a previously unrecognized natural course that curbs carbon loss against climate change. Slow-growing microbes decisively dominate the studied wooded peatlands, concomitant with plant-induced, high recalcitrant carbon and phenolics. The slow-growing microbes inherently metabolize organic matter slowly. However, the fast-growing microbes that dominate our Sphagnum site (most boreal peatlands as well) decomposed labile carbon >30 times faster than the slow-growing microbes. We show that the high-phenolic shrub/tree induced shifts in microbial composition may compensate for positive effects of temperature and/or drought on metabolism over time in peatlands. This biotic self-sustaining process that modulates abiotic controls on carbon cycling may help better project long-term climate-carbon feedbacks in peatlands.","NA"

Additionally, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate cortical networks found to underlie visuotactile interactions and working-memory matching in our previous work. Analysing response times and signal detection measures, we found older adults to show enhanced multisensory integration and benefit more from successful working memory matching.

Sensory capability, however, independently predicted cognitive status. tACS with beta frequency (20 Hz) accelerated task performance and this effect was more pronounced in the older group. We conclude that sensory capability and information integration represent independent predictors of cognitive status. Finally, we discuss a potential role of the parietal cortex in mediating augmented integration in older adults.","NA"

Due to a massive number of potential drug combinations, there is a need for systematic approaches to identify safe and effective combinations foreach patient, using cost-effective methods. Here, we developed an exact multiobjective optimization method for identifying pairwise or higher-order combinations that show maximal cancer-selectivity. The prioritization of patient-specific combinations is based on Pareto-optimization in the search space spanned by the therapeutic and nonselective effects of combinations. We demonstrate the performance of the method in the context of BRAF-V600E melanoma treatment, where the optimal solutions predicted a number of co-inhibition partners for vemurafenib, a selective BRAF-V600E inhibitor, approved for advanced melanoma. We experimentally validated many of the predictions in BRAF-V600E melanoma cell line, and the results suggest that one can improve selective inhibition of BRAF-V600E melanoma cells by combinatorial targeting of MAPK/ERK and other compensatory pathways using pairwise and third-order drug combinations. Our mechanism-agnostic optimization method is widely applicable to various cancer types, and it takes as input only measurements of a subset of pairwise drug combinations, without requiring target information or genomic profiles. Such data-driven approaches may become useful for functional precision oncology applications that go beyond the cancer genetic dependency paradigm to optimize cancer-selective combinatorial treatments.","NA"

Academic conferences have become more international with high proliferation in the number of meetings and attendees, but the format and quality of their organization lags behind what is possible. As a result, the experience of attending conferences in many disciplines today is not appreciably different in many respects. A few conferences in some disciplines have recently implemented valuable changes for the community and have become more receptive to attendees with families. Many meetings could still be improved significantly in terms of diversity, inclusivity, promoting early career researcher (ECR) networking and career development, venue accessibility, and more importantly, reducing the meetings carbon footprint. These issues are openly visible and to some extent discussed among researchers on social media. It is important to accelerate and mandate these efforts so that researchers in all disciplines, in particular ECRs, consistently benefit from scientific gatherings, for years to come. We examined the current state of over 200 national and international academic meetings in various disciplines for key features of inclusivity and sustainability and propose solutions to make conferences more modern, effective, equitable and intellectually productive for the research community and environmentally sustainable for our planet.

In this work, we present a new analytical method to test structural identifiability of models based on ordinary differential equations, based on the invariance of the equations under the scaling transformation of its parameters.

Here we describe a chemically defined xeno-free method for generating VEC-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) through an intermediate endocardium stage. HPSCs were initially specified to KDR+/ISL1+ multipotent cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), followed by differentiation into endocardial progenitors under the combined treatment with VEGFA, BMP4 and bFGF. In the presence of VEGFA, BMP4 and TGFb, valve endocardial progenitor cells (VEPs) were efficiently derived from endocardial progenitors without a sorting step. Mechanistically, administration of TGFb and BMP4 may specify the VEP fate by facilitating the expression of key transcription factors ETV2 and NFATc1 at the immediate early stage and by activating Notch signaling at the later stage. Notch activation is likely an important part of VEP induction. HPSC-derived VEPs exhibited morphological, molecular and functional similarities to that of the primary VECs isolated from normal human aortic valves. When hPSC-derived VEPs were seeded onto the surface of the de-cellularized porcine aortic valve (DCV) matrix scaffolds, they exhibited higher proliferation and survival potential than HUVEC or the primary VECs. Our results suggest that hPSC-derived VEPs could serve as as a potential platform for the study of valve development, and as starting materials for the construction of the next generation TEVs.","NA"

Predator-induced defense as well as refuge mechanisms are widely seen in these systems and should be incorporated in IGP models to promote coexistence. With this aim, we introduce a nonlinear response to the predation of IG-predator on IG-prey modelling both prey refuge and morphological defenses. The phase diagram of species coexistence is obtained as function of the attack efficiency and the degree of nonlinearity of the defense mechanisms. Further we show how the nonlinearity affects the equilibrium populations. We unveil that there is an optimal nonlinearity at which the convergence towards the stationary coexistence regime is the fastest.","NA"

We used near-isogenic lines to obtain healthy and infected host plants. The microbiome associated with the two types of plant residues was characterised by metabarcoding. A combination of linear discriminant analysis and ecological network analysis was used to compare the microbial communities and to identify micro-organisms interacting with L. maculans. Fungal community structure differed between the two lines at harvest, but not subsequently, suggesting that the presence/absence of the resistance gene influences the microbiome at the base of the stem whilst the plant is alive, but that this does not necessarily lead to differential colonisation of the residues by fungi. Direct interactions with other members of the community involved many fungal and bacterial ASVs (amplicon sequence variants). L. maculans appeared to play a minor role in networks, whereas one ASV affiliated to Plenodomus biglobosus (synonym Leptosphaeria biglobosa) from the Leptosphaeria species complex may be considered a keystone taxon in the networks at harvest. This approach could be used to identify and promote micro-organisms with beneficial effects against residue-borne pathogens, and more broadly, to decipher the complex interactions between multi-species pathosystems and other microbial components in crop residues.","NA"

SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious pathogen that rapidly spread around the world causing the worst pandemic in the past 100 years. SARS-CoV-2 shares high sequence homology with SARS-CoV and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although probably not as lethal as SARS-CoV, its robust transmissibility by asymptomatic individuals is an important contributor to the pandemic. Like other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 encodes four major structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and envelope (E). SARS-CoV E protein is abundant in infected cells and plays a crucial role in viral particle assembly. Moreover, the E proteins of SARS coronaviruses likely have important roles in pathogenesis by manipulating a number of cellular processes. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 E protein could also be a critical virulence factor. Ectopic expression of SARS-CoV E was reported to trigger apoptotic cell death of T lymphocytes, which could potentially contribute to the lymphopenia observed in fatal cases, though a causal association is unproven. A potential mechanism for inducing apoptosis was reported to involve an interaction between a putative Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-like motif in SARS-CoV E and the anti-apoptotic host protein Bcl-xL. Here we provide the first computational evidence indicating that both the SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV-2 E have a C-terminal BH3-like motif.

This likely contributes to limited translational impact. A major bottleneck for the adoption of socially complex, ethology-rich, preclinical procedures are the technical limitations for consistently annotating detailed behavioral repertoires of rodent social behavior. Manual annotation is subjective, prone to observer drift, and extremely time-intensive. Commercial approaches are expensive and inferior to manual annotation. Open-source alternatives often require significant investments in specialized hardware and significant computational and programming knowledge. By combining recent computational advances in convolutional neural networks and pose-estimation with further machine learning analysis, complex rodent social behavior is primed for inclusion under the umbrella of computational neuroethology. Here we present an open-source package with graphical interface and workflow (Simple Behavioral Analysis, SimBA) that uses pose-estimation to create supervised machine learning predictive classifiers of rodent social behavior, with millisecond resolution and accuracies that can out-perform human observers. SimBA does not require specialized video acquisition hardware nor extensive computational background. Standard descriptive statistical analysis, along with graphical region of interest annotation, are provided in addition to predictive classifier generation. To increase ease-of-use for behavioural neuroscientists, we designed SimBA with accessible menus for pre-processing videos, annotating behavioural training datasets, selecting advanced machine learning options, robust classifier validation functions and flexible visualizations tools. This allows for predictive classifier transparency, explainability and tunability prior to, and during, experimental use. We demonstrate that this approach is flexible and robust in both mice and rats by classifying social behaviors that are commonly central to the study of brain function and social motivation. Finally, we provide a library of pose-estimation weights and behavioral predictive classifiers for resident-intruder behaviors in mice and rats.

In these studies we used a model that implements enrichment of HLM samples with CYP2E1 through membrane incorporation of the purified protein. Enrichment of HLM with CYP2E1 considerably increases the rate of metabolism of 7-benzyloxyquinoline (BQ) and attenuates the homotropic cooperativity observed with this CYP3A4-specific substrate. Incorporation of CYP2E1 also eliminates the activating effect of alpha-Naphthoflavone (ANF) on BQ metabolism seen in some untreated HLM samples. To probe the physiological relevance of these effects we compared three pulled preparations of HLM from normal donors (HLM-N) with a preparation obtained from heavy alcohol consumers (HLM-A). The composition of the P450 pool in all four samples was characterized with mass-spectrometric determination of 11 cytochrome P450 species. The molar content of CYP2E1 in HLM-A was from 2.5 to 3.3 times higher than that found in HLM-N. In contrast, the content of CYP3A4 in HLM-A was the lowest among all four HLM samples. Despite of that, HLM-A exhibited much higher rate of metabolism and lower degree of homotropic cooperativity with BQ, similar to that observed in CYP2E1-enriched HLM-N. In order to substantiate the hypothesis on the involvement of physical interactions between CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in the observed effects we probed hetero-association of these proteins in SupersomesTM containing recombinant CYP3A4 with a technique based on homo-FRET and employing CYP2E1 labeled with BODIPY-618 maleimide. These experiments demonstrated high affinity interactions between the two enzymes and revealed an inhibitory effect of ANF on their hetero-association.

Results: We found that screening a larger compound library results in more potent actives being identified in all six additional targets using a different docking tool along with its classical SF.

A three-fold increase in average hit rate across targets was also achieved by the ML-based SFs. Lastly, we observed that classical and ML-based SFs often find different actives, which supports using both types of SFs on those targets.","NA"

However, information on gene-Mendelian disease associations, rare pathogenic mutations driving the disease, and the disease phenotype ontology is dispersed across many data sources and does not integrate easily with enrichment analysis. MendelVar is a new webserver facilitating transfer of knowledge from Mendelian disease research into interpretation of genetic associations from GWAS of complex traits. MendelVar allows querying of pre-defined or LD-determined genomic intervals against a comprehensive integrated database to find overlap with genes linked to Mendelian disease. Next, MendelVar looks for enrichment of any Human Phenotype Ontology, Disease Ontology and other ontology/pathway terms associated with identified Mendelian genes. In addition, MendelVar provides a list of all overlapping pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for Mendelian disease sourced from ClinVar. Inclusion of information obtained from MendelVar in post-GWAS gene annotation pipelines can strengthen the case for causal importance of some genes. Moreover, as genes with Mendelian disease evidence may make for more successful drug targets, this may be particularly useful in drug discovery pipelines. Taking GWAS summary statistics for male-pattern baldness, intelligence and atopic dermatitis, we demonstrate the use of MendelVar in prioritizing candidate genes at these loci which are linked to relevant enriched ontology terms.

Sox17 is a key regulator of definitive endoderm development, and yet, its genomic targets remain largely uncharacterized. Here, using genomic approaches and epistasis experiments, we define the Sox17-governed endoderm GRN in Xenopus gastrulae. We show that Sox17 functionally interacts with the canonical Wnt pathway to specify and pattern the endoderm while repressing alternative mesectoderm fates. Together, Sox17 and {beta}-catenin bind hundreds of key enhancers. In some cases, Sox17 and {beta}-catenin synergistically activate transcription in the absence of Tcfs, whereas on other enhancers, Sox17 represses {beta}-catenin/Tcf-mediated transcription to spatially restrict gene expression domains. Our findings establish Sox17 as a tissue-specific modifier of Wnt responses and point to a novel paradigm where genomic specificity of Wnt/ {beta}-catenin transcription is determined through functional interactions between lineage-specific Sox TFs and {beta}-catenin/Tcf transcriptional complexes. Given the ubiquitous nature of Sox TFs and Wnt signaling, this could be a general feature of Sox proteins across numerous contexts of development and disease.","NA"

It was shown that eggs deposited by RNAi-EOF1 A. aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes were non-melanized, fragile, and contained nonviable embryos. Motivated by this discovery, we performed RNAi screening of eggshell proteins to determine putative downstream target proteins of intracellular EOF1. We identified several eggshell proteins as essential for eggshell formation in A. aegypti and characterized their phenotypes in detail by molecular and biochemical approaches. We found that Nasrat, Closca, and Polehole structural proteins, together with the Nudel serine protease, are indispensable for eggshell melanization and egg viability. While all four proteins are predominantly expressed in ovaries of adult females, Nudel mRNA expression is highly upregulated in response to blood feeding. Furthermore, we identified four secreted eggshell enzymes as important factors for controlling the processes of mosquito eggshell formation and melanization. These enzymes included three dopachrome converting enzymes and one cysteine protease. All eight characterized eggshell proteins were required for intact eggshell formation. However, their surface topologies in response to RNAi did not phenocopy the effect of RNAi-EOF1. Still, it remains unclear how EOF1 influences eggshell formation and melanization. The use of proteomic analysis of eggshell proteins from RNAi-EOF1 assisted in the identification of additional proteins that could be regulated in EOF1 deficient eggshells.","NA"

We monitored 48 urban trees from five species -- three native and two exotic -- in three parks of Montreal (Canada) for leaf insect herbivory and predator activity on artificial larvae, and linked herbivory and predation with tree density and tree diversity in the vicinity of focal trees. Leaf insect herbivory decreased with increasing tree diversity, and predator attack rate on artificial larvae increased with tree density around focal trees.

Here we draw insights from recent work on constraint closure that suggests ways of grappling with ecological complexity that yield generalizable theoretical insights. Using a set of evolutionary constraints on species flow through ecological communities, which include: selection, species drift, dispersal, and speciation, combined with multispecies interactions such as mutualistic interactions, and abiotic constraints, we demonstrate how constraint closure allows communities to emerge as semi-autonomous structures. Here we develop an agent-based model to explore how evolutionary constraints provide stability to ecological communities. The model is written in Netlogo, an agent based-modeling system, with advanced tools for manipulating spatially structured models and tools for tracking pattern formation. We articulate ways that ecological pattern formation, viewed through the lens of constraint closure, informs questions about stability and turnover in community ecology. The role of the chosen constraints was clear from the simulation results. It took the shape of both inducing stability and creating conditions for a more dynamic community with increases in species turnover through time. Key ecological and evolutionary variables showed overall stability in the landscape structure when plotted against the number of constraints, suggesting that these evolutionary forces act as constraints to the flow of species in such a way that constraint closure is achieved effecting semi-autonomy.","NA"

Here we produce a de novo assembly of the New World malaria mosquito, Anopheles albimanus by integrating Oxford Nanopore sequencing, Illumina, Hi-C and optical mapping. This 172.6 Mbps female assembly, which we call AalbS3, is obtained by scaffolding polished large contigs (contig N50=13.7 Mbps) into three chromosomes. All chromosome arms end with telomeric repeats, which is the first in mosquito assemblies and represents a significant step towards the completion of a genome assembly. These telomeres consist of tandem repeats of a novel 30-32 bp telomeric repeat unit (TRU) and are confirmed by analysing the termini of long reads and through both chromosomal in situ hybridization and a Bal31 sensitivity assay. The AalbS3 assembly included previously uncharacterized centromeric and rDNA clusters and more than doubled the content of transposable elements and other repetitive sequences. This telomere-to-telomere assembly, although still containing gaps, represents a significant step towards resolving biologically important but previously hidden genomic components. The comparison of different scaffolding methods will also inform future efforts to obtain reference-quality genomes for other mosquito species.

Here we use phase-encoded presentation of 3D planar surfaces with linear gradients defined by horizontal binocular disparity while measuring fMRI activity to test whether the representation of 3D surface tilt is functionally organized within visual cortex. We find functionally defined structures within V3A and V7. Most notably, in one participant we find that the tilt preference is unilaterally organized in a pinwheel-like structure, similar to those observed for orientation preference in V1, which encompasses most of area V3A. These findings indicate that 3D orientation is functionally organized within the human visual cortex, and the evidence suggesting the presence of a large pinwheel-like structure indicates that this type of organization may be applied canonically within the brain at multiple scales.","NA"

Large spectral-power fluctuations across all sites occurred at two characteristic timescales, sub-second and seconds, yielding distinct patterns of cross-frequency associations. On the fast sub-second timescale, within-site (local) associations were consistently between pairs of {beta}-{gamma} frequencies differing by a constant {Delta}f (particularly {Delta}f ~ 10 Hz at posterior sites and {Delta}f ~ 16 Hz at lateral sites) suggesting that higher-frequency oscillations are organized into {Delta}f amplitude-modulated packets, whereas cross-site (long-distance) associations were all within-frequency (particularly in the >30 Hz and 6-12 Hz ranges, suggestive of feedforward and feedback interactions). On the slower seconds timescale, within-site (local) associations were characterized by a broad range of frequencies selectively associated with ~10 Hz at posterior sites and associations among higher (>20 Hz) frequencies at lateral sites, whereas cross-site (long-distance) associations were characterized by a broad range of frequencies at posterior sites selectively associated with ~10 Hz at other sites, associations among higher (>20 Hz) frequencies among lateral and anterior sites, and prevalent associations at ~10 Hz. Regardless of timescale, within-site (local) cross-frequency associations were weak at anterior sites indicative of frequency-specific operations. Overall, these results suggest that the fast sub-second-timescale coordination of spectral power is limited to local amplitude modulation and insulated within-frequency long-distance interactions (likely feedforward and feedback interactions), while characteristic patterns of cross-frequency interactions emerge on the slower seconds timescale. The results also suggest that the occipital  oscillations play a role in organizing higher-frequency oscillations into ~10 Hz amplitude-modulated packets to communicate with other regions.

In this study, we investigated the existence and properties of endogenous default options in a task involving choices between risky lotteries. By manipulating and examining the effects of three experimental features - time pressure, time spent on task and relative choice proportion towards a specific option -, we reveal and dissociate two features of endogenous default options which bias individuals' choices: a natural tendency to prefer certain types of options (natural default), and the tendency to implicitly learn a default option from past choices (learned default). Additional analyses suggest that while the natural default may bias the standard choice process towards an option category, the learned default effects may be attributable to a second independent choice process.

As a proof of concept, we apply these measures on a large sleep EEG dataset (N = 175; 81 females; age range: 17-60 years) with previously demonstrated effects of age, sex and intelligence. As predicted, aging is associated with decreased overall spectral slopes (increased exponents) and whitened spectral peak amplitudes in the spindle frequency range. In addition, age associates with decreased sleep spindle spectral peak frequencies in the frontal region. Women were characterized by higher spectral intercepts and higher spectral peak frequencies in the sleep spindle range. No sex differences in whitened spectral peak amplitudes of the sleep spindle range were found. Intelligence correlated positively with whitened spectral peak amplitudes of the spindle frequency range in women, but not in men. Last, age-related increases in spectral exponents did not differ in subjects with average and high intelligence.

OBIF performs full factorial analysis of feature expression data from single vs. dual factor exposures to identify molecular clusters that reveal synergy-mediating pathways, functions and regulators. As a practical demonstration, OBIF analyzed a therapeutic dyad of immunostimulatory small molecules that induces synergistic protection against influenza A pneumonia. OBIF analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data identified biologically relevant, unanticipated cooperation between RelA and cJun that we subsequently confirmed to be required for the synergistic antiviral protection. To demonstrate generalizability, OBIF was applied to data from a diverse array of Omics platforms and experimental conditions, successfully identifying the molecular clusters driving their synergistic responses.

The number of plant species was highest in old grasslands, followed by new grasslands and forests. This pattern was much clearer in the number of grassland-dependent native and grassland-dependent endangered species, indicating the role of old grasslands as refugia for those species. The species composition differed between old and new grasslands. New grasslands had species compositions in between those of old grasslands and forests, suggesting that the plant community in new grasslands retains the influence of past forestation for more than 52 years after deforestation. Eleven indicator species were detected in old grasslands, but none in new grasslands, suggesting the uniqueness of the plant community in old grasslands.

Each of these stages is influenced simultaneously by particular species traits and abiotic factors. While the importance of many of these determinants has already been investigated in relative isolation, they are rarely studied in combination and even then mostly ignore the final phase, i.e., landscape spread. Here we address this shortcoming by exploring the effect of both species traits and abiotic factors on the success of invasions using an individual-based mechanistic model, and relate those factors to the stages of invasion. This approach enables us to explicitly control abiotic factors (temperature as surrogate for productivity, disturbance and propagule pressure) as well as to monitor whole-community trait distributions of environmental adaptation, mass and dispersal abilities. We simulated introductions of plant individuals to an oceanic island to assess which abiotic factors and species traits contribute to invasion success. We found that the most influential factors were higher propagule pressure and a particular set of traits. This invasion trait syndrome was characterized by a relative similarity in functional traits of invasive species to natives, while invasives had on average higher environmental tolerances, higher body mass and increased dispersal abilities, i.e., were more generalist and dispersive.

Sequence-based approaches have so far offered little evidence for this phenomenon. For example, a recent study estimated the number of shared ('public') antibody clonotypes in circulating baseline repertoires to be around 0.02% across ten unrelated individuals. However, to engage the same epitope, antibodies only require a similar binding site structure and the presence of key paratope interactions, which can occur even when their sequences are dissimilar. Here, we investigate functional convergence in human antibody repertoires by comparing the antibody structures they contain. We first structurally profile baseline antibody diversity (using snapshots from 41 unrelated individuals), predicting all modellable distinct structures within each repertoire. This analysis uncovers a high degree of structural commonality. For instance, around 3% of distinct structures are common to the ten most diverse individual samples ('Public Baseline' structures). Our approach is the first computational method to provide support for the long-assumed levels of baseline repertoire functional commonality.

Although the B. pertussis T3SS would play a role in host colonization, the efficient secretion of type III secreted proteins from B. pertussis has not been observed. To investigate the roles of type III secreted proteins during infection, we attempted to optimize culture conditions for the production and secretion of a type III secreted protein, BteA, in B. pertussis. We observed that B. pertussis efficiently secretes BteA in ascorbic acid-depleted (AsA-) medium. When L2 cells, a rat lung epithelial cell line, were infected with B. pertussis cultured in the AsA- medium, BteA-dependent cytotoxicity was observed. We also performed an immunofluorescence assay of L2 cells infected with B. pertussis. The clear fluorescence signals of Bsp22, a needle structure of T3SS, were detected on the bacterial surface of B. pertussis cultured in the AsA- medium. Moreover, when B. pertussis was cultured in liquid medium containing other reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol and dithioerythritol, the production of type III secreted proteins was repressed. These results suggest that in B. pertussis, the production and secretion of type III secreted proteins are downregulated under reducing conditions.","NA"

Here we present microbiome and metabolomic results from the Routine Early Antibiotic use in Symptomatic preterm Neonates (REASON) study, which is the first trial to randomize symptomatic preterm neonates to receive or not receive antibiotics in the first 48 hours after birth. Using 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples collected longitudinally for 91 neonates, we show that antibiotics alter trends in microbiome diversity and development between randomized neonates and illustrate that type of nutrition helps shape the early infant gut microbiome. Integrating multi-omic data for the gut microbiome, stool immune markers, stool metabolites, and inferred metabolic pathways, we identified an association between Veillonella and the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

Upon arrival in the MB, sensory information undergoes a profound transformation. Olfactory projection neurons (PNs), the main MB input, exhibit broadly tuned, sustained, and stereotyped responses to odorants; in contrast, their postsynaptic targets in the MB, the Kenyon cells (KCs), are nonstereotyped, narrowly tuned, and only briefly responsive to odorants. Theory and experiment have suggested that this transformation is implemented by random connectivity between KCs and PNs. However, this hypothesis has been challenging to test, given the difficulty of mapping synaptic connections between large numbers of neurons to achieve a unified view of neuronal network structure. Here we used a recent whole-brain electron microscopy (EM) volume of the adult fruit fly to map large numbers of PN-to-KC connections at synaptic resolution. Comparison of the observed connectome to precisely defined null models revealed unexpected network structure, in which a subset of food-responsive PN types converge on individual downstream KCs more frequently than expected. The connectivity bias is consistent with the neurogeometry: axons of the overconvergent PNs tend to arborize near one another in the MB main calyx, making local KC dendrites more likely to receive input from those types. Computational modeling of the observed PN-to-KC network showed that input from the overconvergent PN types is better discriminated than input from other types. These results suggest an 'associative fovea' for olfaction, in that the MB is wired to better discriminate more frequently occurring and ethologically relevant combinations of food-related odors.","NA"

We therefore adopt a positional and longitudinal approach to study progressive changes to barley DNA methylation patterns in response to salt exposure during development under greenhouse conditions. Methylation-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) and phenotypic analyses of nine diverse barley varieties were grown in a randomized plot design, under two salt treatments (0 mM and 75 mM NaCl).

We confirmed that both 21 and 22 nt siRNAs were able to silence a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene in treated leaves of N. benthamiana, but systemic silencing of GFP occurred only when the guide strand contained 22 nt. Silencing in the treated leaves of N. benthamiana was demonstrated for 3 endogenous genes: magnesium cheletase subunit I (CHL-I), magnesium cheletase subunit H (CHL-H), and GUN4. However, systemic silencing of these endogenous genes was not observed. Very high levels of transitive siRNAs were produced for GFP in response to treatment with 22 nt siRNAs, but only low levels were produced in response to a 21 nt siRNA. The endogenous genes tested also had more transitive siRNAs produced in response to 22 nt siRNAs, but the response varied from weak (CHL-I) to strong (CHL-H). 22 nt siRNAs produced greater local silencing phenotypes than 21 nt siRNAs for GFP, CHL-H and GUN4 in N. benthamiana. The special activity of 22 nt siRNAs in producing a greater local phenotype and induction of elevated levels of transitive siRNAs was also shown in A. cruentus for the CHL-H gene.

We first derived the climatic variables associated with the geographic distribution of 24 populations across two continents to trace the whole scale of environmental variation experienced by the species, and measure variation in the cold tolerance of the flies of six populations from different geographic contexts. We then performed pooled whole genome sequencing of these six populations, and used Bayesian methods to identify SNPs where genetic differentiation is associated with both climatic variables and the population phenotypic measurements. The top candidate SNPs were enriched on the X and 4th chromosomes, and they also lie near genes implicated in other studies of cold tolerance and population divergence in this species and its close relatives. We conclude that ecological adaptation has contributed to the divergence of D. montana populations throughout the genome and in particular on the X and 4th chromosomes, which also showed highest interpopulation Fst. This study demonstrates that ecological selection can drive genomic divergence at different scales, from candidate genes to chromosome-wide effects.","NA"

Not only do such molecules often fulfil critical biological functions, but also, they may alter the binding of newly designed drugs. In crystal structures, sites consistently occupied in each unit cell yield electron density clouds that represent water molecule presence. These are recorded in virtually all high-resolution structures obtained through X-ray diffraction. In this work, we utilized the wealth of data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank to train a residual deep learning model named 'hotWater' to identify sites on the surface of proteins that are most likely to bind water, the so-called water hot spots. The model can be used to score existing water molecules from a PDB file to provide their ranking according to the predicted binding strength or to scan the surface of a protein to determine the most likely water hot spots de novo. This is computationally much more efficient than currently used molecular dynamics simulations. Based on testing the model on three example proteins, which have been resolved using both high-resolution X-ray crystallography (providing accurate positions of trapped waters) as well as low-resolution X-ray diffraction, NMR or CryoEM (where structure refinement does not yield water positions), we were able to show that the hotWater method is able to recover in the ''water-free'' structures many water binding sites known from the high-resolution structures. A blind test on a newly solved protein structure with waters removed from the PDB also showed good prediction of the crystal water positions. This was compared to two known algorithms that use electron density and was shown to have higher recall at resolutions >2.6[A]. We also show that the algorithm can be applied to novel proteins such as the RNA polymerase complex from SARS-CoV-2, which could be of use in drug discovery.

Here, we provide four biological and analytical factors that explain why certain genes may exhibit ""outlier"" behavior, namely, rate of molecular evolution, alignment length, misidentified orthology, and errors in modeling. Using empirical and simulated data we show how excluding genes based on their likelihood or inferring processes from the topology they support in a supermatrix can mislead biological inference of conflict. We next show alignment length accounts for the high influence of two genes reported in empirical datasets. Finally, we also re-iterate the impact misidentified orthology and short alignments have on likelihoods in large scale phylogenetics. We suggest that researchers should systematically investigate and describe the source of influential genes, as opposed to discarding them as outliers.

We therefore generated a mouse model using CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce the most prevalent hypomorphic missense mutation in European patients, at a site that is also conserved in mice, Pigv:c.1022C>A (p.A341E). Reflecting the human pathology mutant Pigv341E mice showed deficits in motor coordination and cognitive impairment with poorer long-term spatial memory than wild-type mice, as well as alterations in sociability and sleep patterns. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed decreased synaptophysin-immunoreactivity and electrophysiology recordings demonstrated reduced hippocampal synaptic transmission in Pigv341E mice that may underlie impaired memory formation. To gain a deeper and broader molecular understanding of the consequences of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor deficiency, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on acutely isolated hippocampal cells of Pigv341E and wild-type mice. We found that hippocampal cells from adult Pigv341E mice exhibited changes in gene expression, most prominently in a subtype of microglia and subicular neurons.

It has been widely accepted that the signals change the rotation bias of the motor without influencing the motor speed. Here, we obtain results to the contrary and show that the bacteria is also capable of modulating motor speed on merely sensing a ligand. The response of single bacterial flagellar motors to step changes in ligand concentration demonstrate the presence of a sophisticated signalling pathway that controls the motor speed via recruitment of stators. Swimming speeds measured at the population level also corroborate the above observation.

In this work, ReHo and fALFF features from 82 Parkinson's Disease subjects are used to train machine learning predictors of baseline clinical severity and progression at 1 year, 2 years, and 4 years follow-up as measured by the Movement Disorder Society Unified Depression Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) score. This is the first time that rs-fMRI and machine learning have been combined to predict future disease progression. The machine learning models explain up to 30.4% (R^2 = 0.304) of the variance in baseline MDS-UPDRS scores, 55.8% (R^2 = 0.558) of the variance in year 1 scores, and 47.1% (R^2 = 0.471) of the variance in year 2 scores with high statistical significance (p < 0.0001). For distinguishing high- and low-progression individuals (MDS-UPDRS score above or below the median), the models achieve positive predictive values of up to 71% and negative predictive values of up to 84%. The models learn patterns of ReHo and fALFF measures that predict better and worse prognoses. Higher ReHo and fALFF in regions of the default motor network predicted lower current severity and lower future progression. The rs-fMRI features in the temporal lobe, limbic system, and motor cortex were also identified as predictors.

It has been proposed that PRC2 is recruited to genomic loci via the recognition of PRC1-mediated mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1), but the mechanism of this process remains poorly understood. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of human PRC2 with cofactors JARID2 and AEBP2 bound to a nucleosome substrate containing H2AK119ub1. We find that JARID2 and AEBP2 each interact with one of the two ubiquitin molecules in the nucleosome. A ubiquitin-interaction motif (UIM) in JARID2 is sandwiched between ubiquitin and the histone H2A-H2B acidic patch. Simultaneously, the tandem zinc-fingers of AEBP2 interact with the second ubiquitin and the histone H2A-H2B surface on the opposite side of the nucleosome. JARID2 plays a dual role in the H2AK119ub1 dependent stimulation of PRC2 through interactions with both EED via its K116 trimethylation and with the H2AK119-ubiquitin. AEBP2, on the other hand, appears to primarily serve as a scaffold contributing to the interaction between PRC2 and the H2AK119ub1 nucleosome. Our structure also provides a detailed visualization of the EZH2-nucleosome interface, revealing a segment of EZH2 (named ""bridge helix"") that is stabilized as it bridges the EZH2(SET) domain, the H3 tail and the nucleosomal DNA. In addition to the role played by AEBP2 and JARID2 in PRC2 regulation by H2AK119ub1 recognition, we also observe that the presence of these cofactors partially overcomes the inhibitory effect that H3K4- and H3K36- trimethylation have on core PRC2. Together, our results reveal the central role played by cofactors JARID2 and AEBP2 in orchestrating the crosstalk between histone post-translational modifications and PRC2 methyltransferase activity.","NA"

Such emulsions are commonly unstable towards coalescence, yet in order to be functional, they must persist inside the cell. This observation thus raises the fundamental question of the origin of the stability of such emulsions, and whether passive physical mechanisms exist that stabilize droplets against fusion or coalescence. Here, through measurement of condensate zeta potentials on a single droplet level, we show that surface electrostatic properties of condensates can be used to describe and assess the emulsion stability of condensed liquid biomolecular systems. We find that condensates formed from a representative set of peptide/nucleic acid and protein systems have zeta potentials in the stability range predicted by classical colloid theory. Specifically, we describe the electrostatic nature of PR25:PolyU and FUS condensates and show that their zeta potentials correlate well with their propensity to fuse, coalesce, and cluster. Further, we bring together experiments with multiscale molecular simulations and demonstrate that the differences in zeta potential and subsequent stability of biomolecular condensates are modulated by their internal molecular organization. Taken together, these findings shed light on the origin of the stability of biomolecular condensate systems, and connect the organization of molecular-level building blocks to the overall stability of phase-separated biomolecular systems.","NA"

The free-living (FL) community was taxonomically richer and more stable than the particle-associated (PA) one, which was characterized by recurrent ""blooms"" of heterotrophic bacteria such as Alteromonas and Ralstonia. The heterotrophic FL and PA communities were also correlated with different environmental parameters: depth and phytoplankton correlated with the FL population, whereas PA bacteria were correlated primarily with season. A significant part of the variability in community structure could not, however, be explained by the measured environmental parameters. The metabolic potential of the PA community, predicted from 16S amplicon data, was enriched in pathways associated with the degradation and utilization of biological macromolecules, as well as plastics, other petroleum products and herbicides.

In the context of biodiversity loss, our analyses revealed a unifying pattern: dilution effects were inconsistently observed for natural biodiversity gradients, but were commonly observed for biodiversity gradients generated by disturbances causing losses of native biodiversity. Incorporating biodiversity loss into tests of generality of the dilution effect further indicated that scale-dependency may strengthen the dilution effect only when biodiversity gradients are driven by biodiversity loss.

Here we quantify the rate at which the causal NAHR, in inverted repeats flanking the FLNA and EMD genes, occurs in meiosis using digital PCR of sperm samples, with male cheek cells as controls. NAHR was documented in all samples, including the cheek cell samples at a mean recombination rate of 1.8%, indicating that NAHR occurs much more frequently than initially believed, and appears to be occurring in mitosis.

Mutations in this channel can result in painful conditions as well as produce insensitivity to pain. Despite being recognized as a 'poster child' for nociceptive signaling and human pain, targeting NaV1.7 has not yet produced a clinical drug. Recent work has illuminated the NaV1.7 interactome, offering insights into the regulation of these channels and identifying potentially new druggable targets. Amongst the regulators of NaV1.7 is the cytosolic collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). CRMP2, modified at Lysine 374 (K374) by addition of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), bound NaV1.7 to regulate its membrane localization and function. Corollary to this, preventing CRMP2 SUMOylation was sufficient to reverse mechanical allodynia in rats with neuropathic pain. Notably, loss of CRMP2 SUMOylation did not compromise other innate functions of CRMP2. To further elucidate the in vivo role of CRMP2 SUMOylation in pain, we generated CRMP2 K374A knock-in (CRMP2K374A/K374A) mice in which Lys374 was replaced with Ala. CRMP2K374A/K374A mice had reduced NaV1.7 membrane localization and function in female, but not male, sensory neurons. Behavioral appraisal of CRMP2K374A/K374A mice demonstrated no changes in depressive or repetitive, compulsive-like behaviors, and a decrease in noxious thermal sensitivity. No changes were observed in CRMP2K374A/K374A mice to inflammatory, acute, or visceral pain.

Previous reports of cadherin-6 on human platelets have demonstrated its role in platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Objectives: We aimed to further characterize the importance of cadherin-6 in thrombosis in vivo. Methods: Cadherin-6 platelet expression was evaluated by western blotting, flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation. Thrombosis was evaluated using the FeCl3 and Rose Bengal carotid artery models in C57Bl6 mice treated with anti-cadherin-6 or IgG and wild-type or Cdh6-/- mice. Platelet function was compared in wild type and Cdh6-/- mice using tail-clip assays and aggregometry. Results: Human platelet expression of cadherin-6 was confirmed at ~3,000 copies per platelet. Cdh6-/- mice or those treated with anti-Cadherin-6 antibody showed an increased time to occlusion in both thrombosis models. Cadherin-6 was not expressed on mouse platelets, and there were no differences in tail bleeding times or platelet aggregation in wild-type versus Cdh6-/- mice. Conclusions: Cadherin-6 plays an essential role in thrombosis in vivo. However, cadherin-6 is not expressed on murine platelets. These data are in contrast to human platelets, which express a functional cadherin-6/catenin complex. The essential, platelet-independent role for cadherin-6 in hemostasis may allow it to be an effective and safe therapeutic target.","NA"

This is achieved through cycles of metabolic depression and reduced body temperature (torpor) and rewarming (arousal). Rewarming from torpor is achieved through the activation of brown fat (BAT) associated with a rapid increase in ventilation frequency. Here, we studied the rate of rewarming in the European hamster by measuring both BAT temperature, core body temperature and ventilation frequency. Results: Temperature was monitored in in parallel in the BAT (IPTT tags) and peritoneal cavity (iButtons) during hibernation torpor-arousal cycling. We found that increases in brown fat temperature preceeded core body temperature rises by about 47 min, and this was accompanied by a significant increase in ventilation frequency. The rate of rewarming was slowed by the presence of a spontaneous thymus tumour in one of our animals. Core body temperature re-warming was reduced by 6.2*h-1 and BAT rewarming by 12*h-1. Ventilation frequency was increased by 77% during re-warming in the thymus tumour animal compared to a healthy animal. Inspection of the position and size of the tumour indicated that the lungs and heart were obstructed. Conclusions: We validated a minimally invasive method to monitor BAT temperature during hibernation. Using this method we showed compromised re-warming from hibernation in an animal with a thymus tumour, the likely cause of which is obstruction of the lungs and heart leading to inefficient ventilation and circulation.","NA"

Given the rapid emergence of this pathogen, little is known about its genetic variation, immune system interactions, population prevalence, and environmental distribution. As a result, there is a pressing clinical and public health need for scalable molecular technologies that can rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and robustly interrogate strain evolution and host response in patients. To address these challenges, we designed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection within 30 minutes of application, including directly from lysed cells. Simultaneously, we developed a large-scale host and viral transcriptomic profiling platform that employs total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Applying both technologies to 442 samples, spanning 338 clinical samples tested for SARS-CoV-2, 86 environmental samples from the NYC subway, and 14 controls, we assembled a broad molecular picture of the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC. We found close concordance between viral titers measured with our rapid LAMP assay, RNA-seq, and the state-of-the-art RT-PCR. Full transcriptomic analyses revealed a distinct subset of the Western European clade A2a as the predominant genomic subtype in NYC cases, which was defined by two single nucleotide variants in nsp2 and ORF 3a and a clade-specific, 9-bp in-frame deletion in the virulence factor nsp1. High SARS-Cov2 viral titers were associated with distinct host transcriptional responses, including activation of the ACE2 gene and interferon response genes (e.g., IFIT1). Since ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) can also increase ACE2 expression, outcomes for patients taking ACEIs were examined, and showed a significantly increased risk of intubation and death. Our results demonstrate the utility of two molecular diagnostic platforms in defining the genetic features of an evolving global pandemic and provide insights that can aid future COVID-19 diagnostics, public health monitoring, and therapeutic options.","NA"

Motile ciliopathy can result from defects in the dyneins themselves or from defects in factors required for their cytoplasmic pre-assembly. Recent work demonstrates that axonemal dyneins, their specific assembly factors, and broadly acting chaperones are concentrated in liquid-like organelles in the cytoplasm called DynAPs. Here, we use in vivo imaging to show that inner dynein arm (IDA) and outer dynein arm (ODA) subunits are partitioned into non-overlapping sub-regions within DynAPs. Using affinity purification mass-spectrometry of in vivo interaction partners, we also identify novel partners for inner and outer dynein arms. Among these, we identify C16orf71/Daap1 as a novel axonemal dynein regulator. Daap1 interacts with ODA subunits, localizes specifically to the cytoplasm, is enriched in DynAPs, and is required for the deployment of ODAs to axonemes. Our work reveals a new complexity in the structure and function of a cell-type specific liquid-like organelle that is directly relevant to a human genetic disease.","NA"

Developmental and functional abnormalities are a major cause of kidney diseases during childhood; however, the potential causal relationship to exposure with nephrotoxic drugs during nephrogenesis is widely unknown. To identify developmental nephrotoxic drugs in a large scale, we established and performed an automated high-content screen to score for phenotypic renal alterations in the Tg(wt1b:EGFP) zebrafish line. During early nephrogenesis, embryos were exposed to a compound library of approved drugs. After treatment, embryos were aligned within microtiter plates using 3D-printed orientation tools enabling the robust acquisition of consistent dorsal views of pronephric kidneys by automated microscopy. To qualitatively and quantitatively score and visualize phenotypes, we developed software tools for the semi-automated analysis, processing and visualization of this large image-based dataset. Using this scoring scheme, we were able to categorize compounds based on their potential developmental nephrotoxic effects. About 10% of tested drugs induced pronephric phenotypes including glomerular and tubular malformations, or overall changes in kidney morphology. Major chemical compound groups identified to cause glomerular and tubular alterations included dihydropyridine derivatives, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, fibrates, imidazole, benzimidazole and triazole derivatives, corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, acetic acid derivatives and propionic acid derivatives. In conclusion, the presented study demonstrates the large-scale screening of kidney-specific toxicity of approved drugs in a live vertebrate embryo. The associated technology and tool-sets can be easily adapted for other organ systems providing a unique platform for in vivo large-scale assessment of organ-specific developmental toxicity or other biomedical applications. Ultimately, the presented data and associated visualization and browsing tools provide a resource for potentially nephrotoxic drugs and for further investigations.","NA"

Building on this structural framework, we design biochemical experiments to establish the order of events during cohesin loading. In an initial step, DNA traverses an N-terminal kleisin gate that is first opened upon ATP binding and then closed as the cohesin loader locks the DNA against a shut ATPase gate. ATP hydrolysis leads to ATPase gate opening to complete DNA entry. Whether DNA loading is successful, or rather results in loop extrusion, might be dictated by a conserved kleisin N-terminal tail that guides the DNA through the kleisin gate.

Here, we report that mitochondrial survivin inhibits the selective form of autophagy, called mitophagy, causing an accumulation of respiratory defective mitochondria. Mechanistically the data reveal that survivin prevents recruitment of the E3-ubiquitin ligase Parkin to mitochondria and their subsequent recognition by the autophagosome. The data also demonstrate that, as a consequence of this blockade, cells expressing high levels of survivin have an increased dependency on anaerobic glycolysis.

We developed a new method, called FastSMC, that enables accurate biobank-scale detection of IBD segments transmitted by common ancestors living up to several hundreds of generations in the past. FastSMC combines a fast heuristic search for IBD segments with accurate coalescent-based likelihood calculations and enables estimating the age of common ancestors transmitting IBD regions. We applied FastSMC to 487,409 phased samples from the UK Biobank and detected the presence of ~214 billion IBD segments transmitted by shared ancestors within the past 1,500 years. We quantified time-dependent shared ancestry within and across 120 postcodes, obtaining a fine-grained picture of genetic relatedness within the past two millennia in the UK. Sharing of common ancestors strongly correlates with geographic distance, enabling the localization of a sample's birth coordinates from genomic data. We sought evidence of recent positive selection by identifying loci with unusually strong shared ancestry within recent millennia and we detected 12 genome-wide significant signals, including 7 novel loci. We found IBD sharing to be highly predictive of the sharing of ultra-rare variants in exome sequencing samples from the UK Biobank. Focusing on loss-of-function variation discovered using exome sequencing, we devised an IBD-based association test and detected 29 associations with 7 blood-related traits, 20 of which were not detected in the exome sequencing study. These results underscore the importance of modelling distant relatedness to reveal subtle population structure, recent evolutionary history, and rare pathogenic variation.","NA"

The present experiments examined changes in brain extracellular glucose levels while rats were trained to solve hippocampus-sensitive place or striatum-sensitive response learning tasks for food or water reward. During the first minutes of either place or response training, extracellular glucose levels declined in both the hippocampus and striatum, an effect not seen in untrained, rewarded rats. Subsequently, glucose increased in both brain areas under all training conditions, approaching asymptotic levels ~15-25 min into training. Compared to untrained-food controls, training with food reward resulted in significant increases in the hippocampus but not striatum; striatal levels exhibited large increases to food intake in both trained and untrained groups. In the rats trained to find water, glucose levels increased significantly above the values seen in untrained rats in both hippocampus and striatum. The present findings suggest that decreases in glucose early in training might reflect an increase in brain glucose consumption, perhaps triggering increased brain uptake of glucose from blood, as evident in the increases in glucose late in training. Together with past findings measuring lactate levels under the same conditions, the initial decreases in glucose may also stimulate increased production of lactate from astrocytes to support neural metabolism directly and/or to act as a signal to increase blood flow and glucose uptake into the brain.","NA"

Results: To assess RNA and DNA allele frequencies from matched sequencing datasets, we introduce a method for generating model distributions of variant allele frequencies (VAF) with a given variant read probability. In contrast to other methods, based on whole sequences or single SNV, proposed methodology uses continuous multi-SNV genomic regions. The methodology is implemented in a GeTallele toolbox that provides a suit of functions for integrative analysis, statistical assessment and visualization of Genome and Transcriptome allele frequencies. Using model VAF probabilities, GeTallele allows estimation and comparison of variant read probabilities (VAF distributions) in a sequencing dataset.

TIB has been extended to a wide array of fragmented ecosystems, beyond archipelagoes, surfing on the analogy between habitat patches and islands and the patch-matrix framework. However, patch connectivity often little contributes to explaining species richness in empirical studies. Before interpreting this trend as questioning the broad applicability of TIB principles, one first needs a clear identification of methods and contexts where strong effects of patch structural connectivity are likely to occur. Here, we use spatially explicit simulations of neutral metacommunities to show that patch connectivity effect on local species richness is maximized under a set of specific conditions: (i) patch delineation should be fine enough to ensure that no dispersal limitation occurs within patches, (ii) patch connectivity indices should be scaled according to target organisms' dispersal distance and (iii) the habitat amount around sampled sites (within a distance adapted to organisms' dispersal) should be highly variable. When those three criteria are met, the absence of effect of connectivity on species richness should be interpreted as contradicting TIB predictions.","NA"

The two main lines of evidence are from the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test, which compares divergence and polymorphism data, and the PAML test, which analyzes multi-species divergence data. Here, we apply these two tests concurrently on the genomic data of Drosophila and Arabidopsis. To our surprise, the >100 genes identified by the two tests do not overlap beyond random expectations. The results could mean i) high false positives by either test or ii) high false-negatives by both tests due to low powers. To rule out the latter, we merge every 20 - 30 genes into a ""supergene"". At the supergene level, the power of detection is high, with 8% - 56% yielding adaptive signals. Nevertheless, the calls still do not overlap. Since it is unlikely that one test is largely correct and the other is mostly wrong (see Discussion), the total evidence of adaptive DNA sequence evolution should be deemed unreliable. As suggested by Chen et al., the reported evidence for positive selection may in fact be signals of fluctuating negative selection, which are handled differently by the two tests.

The developmentally important Notch pathway is implicated in cellular response of cancer cells to hypoxia. Yet, the mechanisms that potentiate Notch signaling under hypoxia are not fully understood. Hypoxia is also a stimulus for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major cellular energy sensor. In this study, we investigated if AMPK interacts with the Notch pathway and influences the hypoxia-response of breast cancer cells. Activating AMPK with pharmacological agent or genetic approaches led to an increase in the levels of cleaved Notch1 and elevated Notch signaling in invasive breast cancer cell lines. In contrast, inhibition or depletion of AMPK reduced the amount of cleaved Notch1. Significantly, we show that the hypoxia-induced increase in cleaved Notch1 levels requires AMPK activation. Probing into the mechanism, we demonstrate that AMPK activation impairs the interaction between cleaved Notch1 and its ubiquitin ligase, Itch/AIP4 through the tyrosine kinase Fyn. Under hypoxia, the AMPK-Fyn axis promotes inhibitory phosphorylation of Itch which abrogates its interaction with substrates, thus stabilizing cleaved Notch1 by reducing its ubiquitination and degradation. We further show that inhibition of AMPK alleviates the hypoxia-triggered, Notch-mediated stemness and drug resistance phenotype. Breast cancer patient samples also showed co-expression of hypoxia/AMPK/Notch gene signature. Our work thus establishes AMPK as a key component in the adaptation of breast cancer cells to hypoxia, and proposes therapeutic inhibition of AMPK to mitigate the hypoxia-triggered aggressiveness.","NA"

This is usually done through analysis of the parameters calculated during retrospective head motion correction (i.e., motion parameters). However, it is increasingly recognized that respiration introduces factitious head motion via perturbations of the main (B0) field. This effect appears as higher-frequency fluctuations in the motion parameters (> 0.1 Hz, here referred to as HF-motion), primarily in the phase-encoding direction. This periodicity can sometimes be obscured in standard single-band fMRI (TR 2.0 - 2.5 s.) due to aliasing. Here we examined (1) how prevalent HF-motion effects are in seven single-band datasets with TR from 2.0 - 2.5 s and (2) how HF-motion affects functional connectivity. We demonstrate that HF-motion is relatively trait-like and more common in older adults, those with higher body mass index, and those with lower cardiorespiratory fitness. We propose a low-pass filtering approach to remove the contamination of high frequency effects from motion summary measures, such as framewise displacement (FD). We demonstrate that in most datasets this filtering approach saves a substantial amount of data from FD-based frame censoring, while at the same time reducing motion biases in functional connectivity measures. These findings suggest that filtering motion parameters is an effective way to improve the fidelity of head motion estimates, even in single band datasets. Particularly large data savings may accrue in datasets acquired in older and less fit participants.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116866"

Serotonin regulates both, developmental and experience-dependent neuroplasticity in these circuits. Central serotonergic biosynthesis rates are regulated by Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), and transgenic animal models suggest that TPH2-gene associated differences in serotonergic signaling mediate the impact of aversive early life experiences on a phenotype characterized by anxious avoidance. Methods: The present study employed an imaging genetics approach that capitalized on individual differences in a TPH2 polymorphism (703G/T; rs4570625) to determine whether differences in serotonergic signaling modulate the effects of early life stress on brain structure and function and punishment sensitivity in humans (n = 252). Results: Higher maltreatment exposure before the age of 16 was associated with increased gray matter volumes in a circuitry spanning thalamic-limbic-prefrontal regions and decreased intrinsic communication in limbic-prefrontal circuits selectively in TT carriers. In an independent replication sample, associations between higher early life stress and increased frontal volumes in TT carriers were confirmed. On the phenotype level, the genotype moderated the association between higher early life stress exposure and higher punishment sensitivity. In TT carriers, the association between higher early life stress exposure and punishment sensitivity was critically mediated by increased thalamic-limbic-prefrontal volumes. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that early life stress shapes the neural organization of the limbic-prefrontal circuits in interaction with individual variations in the TPH2 gene to promote a phenotype characterized by facilitated threat avoidance, thus promoting early adaptation to an adverse environment.

However, methods to detect spatiotemporally resolved glucose uptake in intact tissues are far more limited, particularly those that can quantify changes in uptake over time in specific tissue regions and cell types. Using lymph node metabolism as a case study, we developed a novel assay of dynamic and spatially resolved glucose uptake in living tissue by combining ex vivo tissue slice culture with a fluorescent glucose analogue. Live slices of murine lymph node were treated with the glucose analogue 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-dia-xol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG). Incubation and washing parameters were optimized to differentiate glucose uptake in activated versus naive lymphocytes. Confocal microscopy of treated tissues confirmed that the 2-NBDG signal was intracellular. The assay was readily multiplexed with live immunofluorescence labelling to generate maps of 2-NBDG uptake across tissue regions, revealing highest uptake in T cell-dense regions. Uptake was predominantly localized to lymphocytes rather than stromal cells. Because 2-NBDG washed out of the tissue over time, the assay was repeatable in the same slices before and after T cell activation to reveal which tissue regions were most responsive to stimulation. We anticipate that this assay will serve as a broadly applicable, user-friendly platform to quantify dynamic metabolic activities in complex tissue microenvironments.","NA"

Here, we assess the cell type-specific RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL through an integrated analysis of 107 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq studies, including 22 lung and airways datasets (16 unpublished), and 85 datasets from other diverse organs. Joint expression of ACE2 and the accessory proteases identifies specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells as putative targets of viral infection in the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli. Cells that co-express ACE2 and proteases are also identified in cells from other organs, some of which have been associated with COVID-19 transmission or pathology, including gut enterocytes, corneal epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, heart pericytes, olfactory sustentacular cells, and renal epithelial cells. Performing the first meta-analyses of scRNA-seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking, all of which are epidemiologically linked to COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Notably, there was a particularly low expression of ACE2 in the few young pediatric samples in the analysis. Further analysis reveals a gene expression program shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues, including genes that may mediate viral entry, subtend key immune functions, and mediate epithelial-macrophage cross-talk. Amongst these are IL6, its receptor and co-receptor, IL1R, TNF response pathways, and complement genes. Cell type specificity in the lung and airways and smoking effects were conserved in mice. Our analyses suggest that differences in the cell type-specific expression of mediators of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry may be responsible for aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology and clinical course, and point to putative molecular pathways involved in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.","NA"

We anticipate that FAIR data management systems for multi-modal data repositories will play a pivotal role in data-driven research, as the joint analysis of omics and imaging data becomes not only desirable but necessary to derive novel insights into biological processes. In particular for powerful machine learning applications where the availability of large datasets with high quality phenotypic annotations is a requirement.","NA"

N.","Michael L Zhao","Stanford University","2020-04-21",5,"cc_no","new results","cell biology","Terminal differentiation is essential for the development and maintenance of tissues in all multi-cellular organisms and is associated with a permanent exit from the cell cycle. Failure to permanently exit the cell cycle can result in cancer and disease. However, the molecular mechanisms and timing that coordinates differentiation commitment and cell cycle exit are not yet understood. Here using adipogenesis as a model system to track differentiation commitment in live cells, we show that a rapid switch mechanism engages exclusively in G1 to trigger a simultaneous commitment to differentiate and permanently exit from the cell cycle. We identify a signal integration mechanism whereby the strengths of both mitogen and differentiation stimuli control a molecular competition between cyclin D1 and PPARG-induced expression of the CDK inhibitor p21 which in turn regulates if and when the differentiation switch is triggered and when the proliferative window closes. In this way, the differentiation control system is able to couple mitogen and differentiation stimuli to sustain a long-term balance between terminally differentiating cells and maintaining the progenitor cell pool, a parameter of critical importance for enabling proper development of tissue domains and organs.","NA"

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of supplemental tryptophan and a 12-week incremental training regimen on the voluntary activity and behaviour of client-owned Siberian Huskies. Sixteen dogs were blocked for age, BW and sex and then randomly allocated to either the control or treatment group. Both groups were fed the same dry extruded diet; however, the treatment group were supplemented with tryptophan to achieve a tryptophan: large neutral amino acid ratio of 0.075:1. Once a week, a 5-minute video recording was taken immediately pre- and post- exercise to evaluate dogs' behaviours. Activity monitors were used to record voluntary activity on both training and rest days. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between training week and time spent performing each behaviour. Additionally, a repeated measure mixed model was used to test differences between diet groups and training week for both behavioural and activity count data. The time spent performing agonistic behaviours prior to exercise was negatively associated with week for treatment dogs ({beta} = -0.32, 95% CI [-0.55, -0.10], P < 0.05) and no change was observed for control dogs ({beta} = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.41, 0.15], P > 0.10). Treatment did not have any effect on activity levels (P > 0.10). For all dogs, locomotive behaviours decreased prior to exercise as weeks progressed (P < 0.05), while run day voluntary activity depended on the distance run that day (P < 0.05). These data suggest that sled dogs experience an exercise-induced reduction in voluntary locomotion in response to both single bouts and repetitive bouts of exercise. Additionally, tryptophan supplementation may decrease agonistic behaviours, without having any effect on voluntary activity.","NA"

Thus, clustering and biclustering are powerful techniques often used with expression data, but are usually not suitable to unravel molecular mechanisms along with patient subgroups. To alleviate this, we developed the network-constrained biclustering approach BiCoN (Biclustering Constrained by Networks) which (i) restricts biclusters to functionally related genes connected in molecular interaction networks and (ii) maximizes the difference in gene expression between two subgroups of patients. Results: Our analyses of non-small cell lung and breast cancer gene expression data demonstrate that BiCoN clusters patients in agreement with known cancer subtypes while discovering gene subnetworks pointing to functional differences between these subtypes. Furthermore, we show that BiCoN is robust to noise and batch effects and can distinguish between high and low load of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes while identifying subnetworks related to immune cell function. In summary, BiCoN is a powerful new systems medicine tool to stratify patients while elucidating the responsible disease mechanism.

Here, we studied the bumblebee Bombus haematurus Kriechbaumer, 1870, a species historically distributed from northern Serbia through northern Iran which has very recently started expanding north-westwards into Central Europe without human-mediated dispersal (i.e., it is a natural spread). After updating the global distribution of this species, we investigated if niche shifts took place during this range expansion between newly colonized and historical areas. In addition, we have explored which climatic factors have favoured the natural range expansion of the species. Our results indicated that Bombus haematurus has colonized large territories in 7 European countries outside the historical area in the period from the 1980s to 2018, a natural expansion over an area that equals 20% of the historical distribution. In addition, this bumblebee performs generalism in flower visitation and it occurs in different habitats, although a preference for forested areas clearly emerges. The land-use associated with the species in the colonized areas is similar to the historical distribution, indicating that no major niche shifts occurred during the spread. Furthermore, in recently colonized localities, the range expansion was associated with warming temperatures during the winter and also during both overwintering and queen's emergence phases. These findings document a case of natural range expansion due to environmental change rather than due to niche shifts, and specifically they suggest that warmer winters could be linked to the process of natural colonization of new areas.","NA"

We define such sets of traits that evolve in concert and contribute to the success of invasive populations as an ""invasion syndrome"". The invasive Harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis displays such an invasion syndrome with, for instance, females from invasive populations being larger and heavier than individuals from native populations, allocating more resources to reproduction, and spreading reproduction over a longer lifespan. Invasion syndromes could emerge due to selection acting jointly and directly on a multitude of traits, or due to selection on one or a few key traits that drive correlated indirect responses in other traits. Here, we investigated the degree to which the H. axyridis invasion syndrome would emerge in response to artificial selection on either female body mass or on age at first reproduction, two traits involved in their invasion syndrome. To further explore the interaction between environmental context and evolutionary change in molding the phenotypic response, we phenotyped the individuals from the selection experiments in two environments, one with abundant food resources and one with limited resources. The two artificial selection experiments show that the number of traits showing a correlated response depends upon the trait undergoing direct selection. Artificial selection on female body mass resulted in few correlated responses and hence poorly reproduced the invasion syndrome. In contrast, artificial selection on age at first reproduction resulted in more widespread phenotypic changes, which nevertheless corresponded only partly to the invasion syndrome. The artificial selection experiments also revealed a large impact of diet on the traits, with effects dependent on the trait considered and the selection regime. Overall, our results indicate that direct selection on multiple traits was likely necessary in the evolution of the H. axyridis invasion syndrome. Furthermore, they show the strength of using artificial selection to identify the traits that are correlated in different selective contexts, which represents a crucial first step in understanding the evolution of complex phenotypic patterns, including invasion syndromes.","NA"

Although it was traditionally thought that Gag proteins trafficked directly from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, we discovered that the oncogenic avian alpharetrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Gag protein undergoes transient nucleocytoplasmic transport as an intrinsic step in virus assembly. Using a genetic approach in yeast, we identified three karyopherins that engage the two independent nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in Gag. The primary NLS is in the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Gag and binds directly to importin-, which recruits importin-{beta} to mediate nuclear entry. The second NLS, which resides in the matrix (MA) domain, is dependent on importin-11 and transportin-3 (TNPO3), known as MTR10p and Kap120p in yeast, although it is not clear whether these import factors are independent or additive. The functionality of importin /{beta} and importin-11 has been verified in avian cells, whereas the role of TNPO3 has not been studied. In this report, we demonstrate that TNPO3 mediates nuclear entry of Gag and directly binds to Gag. To our surprise, this interaction did not require the cargo-binding domain of TNPO3, which typically mediates nuclear entry for other binding partners of TNPO3 including SR-domain containing splicing factors and tRNAs that re-enter the nucleus. These results suggest that RSV hijacks the host nuclear import pathway using a unique mechanism, potentially allowing other cargo to bind TNPO3 simultaneously.","NA"

We obtained functional (fMRI), diffusion (dMRI), and quantitative (qMRI) magnetic resonance imaging data in 30 adults. fMRI was used to map reading-related responses by contrasting responses in a reading task with those in adding and color tasks; dMRI was used to identify the brain's fascicles and to map their endpoints density in lateral VTC; qMRI was used to measure proton relaxation time (T1), which depends on cortical tissue microstructure. We fit linear models that predict reading-related responses in lateral VTC from endpoint density and T1 and used leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to assess prediction accuracy. Using a subset of our participants (N=10, feature selection set), we find that i) endpoint density of the arcuate fasciculus (AF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF) are significant predictors of reading-related responses, and ii) cortical T1 of lateral VTC further improves the predictions of the fascicle model. Next, in the remaining 20 participants (validation set), we showed that a linear model that includes T1, AF, ILF and VOF significantly predicts i) the map of reading-related responses across lateral VTC and ii) the location of the visual word form area, a region critical for reading.

Additionally, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate cortical networks found to underlie visuotactile interactions and working-memory matching in our previous work. Analysing response times and signal detection measures, we found older adults to show enhanced multisensory integration and benefit more from successful working memory matching. Both measures predicted cognitive status and correlated positively with each other, suggesting that they likely reflect a common underlying tendency to integrate information. Sensory capability, however, independently predicted cognitive status. tACS with beta frequency (20 Hz) accelerated task performance and this effect was more pronounced in the older group. We conclude that sensory capability and information integration represent independent predictors of cognitive status.

While stimulation of neuronal circuits has been shown to enhance oligodendrocyte production and myelination during development, the extent to which physiological stimuli induces activity-dependent plasticity within oligodendrocytes and myelin is unclear, particularly in the adult CNS. Here, we find that using environmental enrichment (EE) to physiologically stimulate neuronal activity for 6-weeks during young adulthood in C57Bl/6 mice results in an enlargement of callosal axon diameters, with a corresponding increase in thickness of pre-existing myelin sheaths. Additionally, EE uniformly promotes the direct differentiation of pre-existing oligodendroglia in both corpus callosum and somatosensory cortex, while differentially impeding OPC homeostasis in these regions. Furthermore, results of this study indicate that physiologically relevant stimulation in young adulthood exerts little influence upon the de novo generation of new myelin sheaths on previously unmyelinated segments and does not enhance OPC proliferation. Rather in this context, activity-dependent plasticity involves the coincident structural remodeling of axons and pre-existing myelin sheaths and increases the direct differentiation of pre-existing oligodendroglia, implying constraints on maximal de novo production in the adult CNS. Together, our findings of myelinated axon remodeling and increased pre-existing oligodendroglial differentiation constitute a previously undescribed form of adaptive myelination that likely contributes to neuronal circuit maturation and the maintenance of optimum cognitive function in the young adult CNS.","NA"

This is achieved through cycles of metabolic depression and reduced body temperature (torpor) and rewarming (arousal). Rewarming from torpor is achieved through the activation of brown fat (BAT) associated with a rapid increase in ventilation frequency. Here, we studied the rate of rewarming in the European hamster by measuring both BAT temperature, core body temperature and ventilation frequency. Results: Temperature was monitored in in parallel in the BAT (IPTT tags) and peritoneal cavity (iButtons) during hibernation torpor-arousal cycling. We found that increases in brown fat temperature preceeded core body temperature rises by about 47 min, and this was accompanied by a significant increase in ventilation frequency. The rate of rewarming was slowed by the presence of a spontaneous thymus tumour in one of our animals. Core body temperature re-warming was reduced by 6.2*h-1 and BAT rewarming by 12*h-1. Ventilation frequency was increased by 77% during re-warming in the thymus tumour animal compared to a healthy animal. Inspection of the position and size of the tumour indicated that the lungs and heart were obstructed. Conclusions: We validated a minimally invasive method to monitor BAT temperature during hibernation.

Often, three key process variables: Titer, Rate and Yield (TRY) are the target of metabolic engineering efforts to improve microbial hosts toward industrial production. Previous research into improving the TRY metrics have examined the efficacy of having distinct growth and production stages to achieve productivity. However, these studies assumed a switch from a maximum growth to a maximum production phenotype. Hence, the choice of operating points for the growth and production stages of two-stage processes is yet to be explored. The impact of reduced growth rates on substrate uptake adds to the need for intelligent choice of operating points while designing two-stage processes. Results: In this work, we develop a computational framework that scans the phenotypic space of microbial metabolism to identify ideal growth and production phenotypic targets, to achieve optimal TRY targets. Using this framework, with Escherichia coli as a model organism, we compare two-stage processes that use dynamic pathway regulation, with one-stage processes that use static intervention strategies, for different bioprocess objectives. Our results indicate that two-stage processes with intermediate growth during the production stage always result in optimal TRY values. By analyzing the flux distributions for the production enhancing strategies, we identify key reactions and reaction subsystems whose fluxes have to be modified to switch to a production phenotype for a wide range of metabolites in E. coli. We found that flux perturbations that increase phosphoenolpyruvate and NADPH availability are enriched among the production phenotypes. Furthermore, reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway emerge as key control nodes that function together to increase the availability of precursors to most products in E. coli. Conclusions: We have shown that even if substrate uptake is limited due to reduced growth during chemical production, two stage processes can result in optimal yields and production rates with intelligent phenotypic choices. The inherently modular nature of microbial metabolism results in common reactions and reaction subsystems that need to be regulated to modify microbes from their target of growth to the production of a diverse range of metabolites.

This distinction allows us to quantify the extent of ribosomal collisions along the transcript and identify individual codons where ribosomal collisions are likely. When examining ribosome profiling in yeast, we observe that translation initiation and elongation are close to their optima, and traffic is minimised at the beginning of the transcript to favour ribosome recruitment.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a degenerate FA pathway is present, but ICLs are predominantly repaired by a pathway involving the Pso2 nuclease that is hypothesized to digest through the lesion to provide access for translesion polymerases. However, mechanistic details of this pathway are lacking, especially relative to FA. We recently identified the Hrq1 helicase, a homolog of the disease-linked RECQL4, as a novel component of Pso2-mediated ICL repair. Here, we show that Hrq1 stimulates the Pso2 nuclease in a mechanism that requires Hrq1 catalytic activity. Importantly, Pso2 alone has meagre translesion nuclease activity on an ICL-containing substrate, but digestion through the lesion dramatically increases in the presence of Hrq1. Stimulation of Pso2 nuclease activity is specific to eukaryotic RecQ4 subfamily helicases, and Hrq1 interacts with Pso2, likely through their N-termini. These results advance our understanding of FA-independent ICL repair and establish a role for the RecQ4 helicases in the repair of these dangerous lesions.","NA"

In many human traits, common small-effect mutations may subtly dysregulate the function of the very same genes which are impacted by rare, large-effect mutations causing Mendelian disease of similar phenotype. However, information on gene-Mendelian disease associations, rare pathogenic mutations driving the disease, and the disease phenotype ontology is dispersed across many data sources and does not integrate easily with enrichment analysis. MendelVar is a new webserver facilitating transfer of knowledge from Mendelian disease research into interpretation of genetic associations from GWAS of complex traits. MendelVar allows querying of pre-defined or LD-determined genomic intervals against a comprehensive integrated database to find overlap with genes linked to Mendelian disease. Next, MendelVar looks for enrichment of any Human Phenotype Ontology, Disease Ontology and other ontology/pathway terms associated with identified Mendelian genes. In addition, MendelVar provides a list of all overlapping pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for Mendelian disease sourced from ClinVar. Inclusion of information obtained from MendelVar in post-GWAS gene annotation pipelines can strengthen the case for causal importance of some genes. Moreover, as genes with Mendelian disease evidence may make for more successful drug targets, this may be particularly useful in drug discovery pipelines. Taking GWAS summary statistics for male-pattern baldness, intelligence and atopic dermatitis, we demonstrate the use of MendelVar in prioritizing candidate genes at these loci which are linked to relevant enriched ontology terms.

Using this method, we report the first high-precision tests of preservation effects on {delta}15NAA in Northern Anchovy (Engraulis mordax) kept 1[1/2]-year in ethanol and up to 27-years in formaldehyde. We found minimal methodological induced fractionation for 8 AAs, and preservation effects on {delta}15N were similar regardless of duration and preservative used.

Although, the effects of both soil temperature and moisture on V. dahliae are well known, there is scant knowledge about what climatic drivers affect the occurrence of the pathogen on a landscape scale. Here, we investigate what climatic drivers determine V. dahliae occurrence in olive-growing areas in southern Spain. In order to bridge this gap in knowledge, a landscape-scale field survey was carried out to collect data on the occurrence of V. dahliae in 779 olive groves in Granada province. Forty models based on competing combinations of climatic variables were fitted and evaluated using information-theoretic methods. A model that included a multiplicative combination of seasonal and extreme climatic variables was found to be the most viable one. Isothermality and the seasonal distribution of precipitation were the most important variables influencing the occurrence of the pathogen. The isothermal effect was in turn modulated by the seasonality of rainfall, and this became less negative as seasonality increases. Thus, V. dahliae occurs more frequently in olive-growing areas where the day-night temperature oscillation is lower than the summer-winter one. We also found that irrigation reduced the influence of isothermality on occurrence. Our results demonstrate that long-term ""sophisticated"" climatic factors rather than ""primary"" variables, such as annual trends, can better explain the spatial patterns of V. dahliae occurrence in Mediterranean, southern Spain. One important implication of our study is that appropriate irrigation management, when temperature oscillation approaches optimal conditions for V. dahliae to thrive, may reduce the appearance of symptoms in olive trees.","NA"

Thus, it is hypothesised that DENV-TIPs may be used as a novel therapeutic agent. However, the effectiveness of DENV-TIPs as an antiviral agent is yet to be explored at an epidemiological scale. We present a mathematical model for the replication of DENV and DENV-TIPs as they interact with human host cells, accounting for the effectiveness of DENV-TIPs in blocking DENV from coinfected cells. We fit the model to sequentially measured plasma viral titre data from primary and secondary dengue serotype 1 infected patients in Vietnam. We show that variation in initial DENV load is sufficient to recreate the observed variation between patients. Parameter estimates, differing in primary and secondary infections, do not confirm a significant difference between these two types of infection. We use our model to investigate the potential impact of DENV-TIPs as an antiviral agent. We conclude that, when the effectiveness of DENV-TIPs in inhibiting DENV from coinfected cells is at least 80%, a dose as high as 10 12 copies per millilitre of blood is required to reduce duration of infection and peak DENV serotype 1 infection level at any time point of infection. This work provides a quantitative understanding of the relationship between DENV-TIPs levels and their efficiency in clearing dengue viral infection.

One of the most impressive and well-documented invasions of the 20th century began in Brazil with the escape of introduced African honey bees (Apis mellifera scutellata) in 1957. In less than 50 years, populations of 'Africanized' honey bees spread across much of the Americas, hybridizing with and outcompeting resident European honey bees. We use broad geographic sampling and whole genome sequencing of over 300 bees to map the distribution of African ancestry where the northern and southern invasions have presently stalled, forming replicated hybrid zones between Africanized and European bees in California and Argentina. California is much further from Brazil, yet these hybrid zones occur at very similar latitudes, consistent with the invasion having reached a climate barrier. At these range limits, we observe genome-wide clines for African ancestry, and parallel clines for wing length that span hundreds of kilometers, supporting a smooth transition from climates favoring Africanized bees to climates where they cannot survive winter. Ancestry clines at individual SNPs are consistent with a broad genetic basis for climate-associated fitness trade-offs, with a build-up of somewhat steeper clines in regions of low recombination and no large effect loci maintaining exceptionally steep ancestry transitions. Additionally, we find no substantial reductions in genetic diversity associated with rapid expansions nor complete dropout of African ancestry at any individual loci, which suggests that the competitive fitness advantage of African ancestry at lower latitudes has a broad genetic basis and that Africanized bees maintained large population sizes during their invasion. To test for parallel selection across continents, we develop a null model that accounts for drift in ancestry frequencies during the rapid expansion. We identify several peaks within a larger genomic region where selection has pushed African ancestry to high frequency hundreds of kilometers past the present cline centers in both North and South America and that may underlie high-fitness African traits driving the invasion.","NA"

By establishing stable in vivo whole-cell recordings of >100 spontaneously active midbrain dopamine neurons in anaesthetized mice, we identified the repertoire of subthreshold membrane potential signatures associated with distinct in vivo firing patterns. We demonstrate that in vivo activity of dopamine neurons deviates from a single spike pacemaker pattern by eliciting transient increases in firing rate generated by at least two diametrically opposing biophysical mechanisms: a transient depolarization resulting in high frequency plateau bursts associated with a reactive depolarizing shift in action potential threshold, and a prolonged hyperpolarization preceding slower rebound bursts characterized by a predictive hyperpolarizing shift in action potential threshold. Our findings therefore illustrate a framework for the biophysical implementation of prediction error coding in dopamine neurons by tuning action potential threshold dynamics.","NA"

We developed a linear mixed effects model-based approach for analyzing the complex alternative RNA splicing regulation patterns detected by whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing technologies. This approach thoroughly characterizes and differentiates three types of genes related to alternative RNA splicing events with distinct differential expression/splicing patterns.

To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant epitope hotspot regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA genotypes of approximately 22 000 individuals to develop a digital twin type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population, and used the approach to identify an optimal constellation of epitopes hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population. By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have managed to profile the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identify a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population.","NA"

Profiles of HIV drug resistance mutations (HIVDRM) and virological failure (VF) are not extensively studied in Tanzania. This study aimed to determine HIVDRM and predictors of VF in HIV-infected individuals failing first-line HIV drugs in Moshi, northern Tanzania. A case-control study was conducted at KCMC, Mawenzi, Pasua and Majengo health facilities with HIV-care and treatment clinics in Moshi from October, 2017 to August, 2018. Cases and controls were HIV-infected individuals with VF and viral suppression (VS) respectively. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease genes were amplified and sequenced. Stanford University's HIV drug resistance database and REGA HIV-1 Subtyping tool 3.0 determined HIVDRM and HIV-1 subtypes respectively. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals investigated predictors of VF. P-value <5% was considered statistically significant. A total of 124 participants were recruited, of whom 63 (50.8%) had VF and 61 (49.2%) had VS. Majority (66.1%) were females. Median [IQR] age and duration on ART were 45 [35-52] years and 72 [48-104] months respectively. Twenty five out of 26 selected HIV-1 RNA samples from cases were successively sequenced. Twenty four samples (96%) had at least one major mutation conferring resistance to HIV drugs, with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) associated mutations as the majority (92%). Frequent NNRTI resistance mutations were K103N (n=11), V106M (n=5) and G190A (n=5). Prevalent nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors mutations were M184V (n=17), K70R (n=7) and D67N (n=6). Dual-class resistance was observed in 16 (64%) samples. Thirteen samples (52%) had at least one thymidine analogue-associated resistance mutation (TAM). Three samples (12%) had T69D mutation with at least 1 TAM. Age was independently associated with VF [aOR 0.94 (0.90-0.97) p<0.001]. In conclusion, HIV drug resistance is common among people failing antiretroviral therapy and resistance testing will help to guide switching of HIV drugs.","NA"

P. aeruginosa and C. albicans transcriptomes were assessed after growth in mono-culture or co-culture with either ethanol-producing C. albicans or a C. albicans mutant lacking the primary ethanol dehydrogenase, Adh1. Analyses using KEGG-pathways and the previously published eADAGE method revealed several P. aeruginosa responses to C. albicans-produced ethanol including the induction of a non-canonical low phosphate response mediated by PhoB. C. albicans wild-type, but not C. albicans adh1 {Delta}/{Delta}, induces P. aeruginosa production of 5-methyl-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5-MPCA), which forms a red derivative within fungal cells. We first demonstrate that PhoB is required for this interaction and that PhoB hyperactivity, via deletion of pstB, leads to increased production of 5-MPCA even when phosphate concentrations are high, but only in the presence of ethanol. Second, we show that ethanol is only sufficient to promote 5-MPCA production at permissive phosphate concentrations. The intersection of ethanol and phosphate in co-culture is mirrored in C. albicans; transcriptome analysis of the C. albicans WT and the ethanol-deficient adh1 {Delta}/{Delta} revealed that the adh1 {Delta}/{Delta} mutant had increased expression of genes regulated by Pho4, the C. albicans transcription factor that responds to low phosphate which we confirmed by showing the adh1 {Delta}/{Delta} strain had elevated Pho4-dependent phosphatase activity. The dual-dependence on ethanol and phosphate concentrations for anti-fungal production highlights how environmental factors modulate microbial interactions and dictate antagonisms such as those between P. aeruginosa and C. albicans.","NA"

This activity requires zinc influx, MAPK activation and YAP1 nuclear translocation. We demonstrate that inhibitors of the classical androgen receptor, also inhibit ZIP9, and thereby antagonize the pro-tumorigenic effects of testosterone in melanoma. In male mice, androgen receptor inhibitors suppressed growth of ZIP9-expressing melanomas, but had no effect on isogenic melanomas lacking ZIP9, nor on melanomas in females. These data suggest that ZIP9 might be effectively targeted in melanoma and other cancers by repurposing androgen receptor inhibitors that are currently approved only for prostate cancer.","NA"

However, there is a segment of high amino acid similarity between human SARS-CoV-2 and a pangolin isolated strain, GD410721, in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, a pattern that can be caused by either recombination or by convergent amino acid evolution driven by natural selection. We perform a detailed analysis of the synonymous divergence, which is less likely to be affected by selection than amino acid divergence, between human SARS-CoV-2 and related strains. We show that the synonymous divergence between the bat derived viruses and SARS-CoV-2 is larger than between GD410721 and SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, providing strong additional support for the recombination hypothesis. However, the synonymous divergence between pangolin strain and SARS-CoV-2 is also relatively high, which is not consistent with a recent recombination between them, instead it suggests a recombination into RaTG13. We also find a 14-fold increase in the dN/dS ratio from the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 to the strains of the current pandemic, suggesting that the vast majority of non-synonymous mutations currently segregating within the human strains have a negative impact on viral fitness.

However, the mechanism by which MSPCs influenced HSC fate decisions remained unknown. Herein, we report the use of proteomic analysis to correlate HSC phenotype to a broad candidate pool of 200 soluble factors produced by combined mesenchymal and hematopoietic progeny. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), along with an iterative filter method, identified TGF{beta}-1, MMP-3, c-RP, and TROY as positively correlated with HSC maintenance.

Findings suggest a cocktail of the downselected cytokines amplify hematopoietic maintenance potential of HSCs beyond that of MSPC-secreted factors alone.

In this study, we have presented a novel approach to analyze the interactions between the chemicals in the medicinal plants and multiple targets based on the complex multipartite network of the medicinal plants, multi-chemicals, and multiple targets. The multipartite network was constructed via the conjunction of two relationships: chemicals in plants and the biological actions of those chemicals on the targets. By analyzing the structural characteristics of the network using the network analysis techniques, we investigated the similarities among the plants via their chemical profiles obtained from the hierarchical clustering analysis. In doing so, we introduced an index of the efficacy of chemicals in a plant on a protein target of interest, called target potency score (TPS). We showed that the analysis can identify specific chemical profiles from each group of plants, which can then be employed for discovering new alternative therapeutic agents. Furthermore, specific clusters of plants and chemicals acting on specific targets were retrieved using TPS that suggested potential drug candidates with high probability of clinical success. We expect that this approach may open a way to predict the biological functions of multi-chemicals and multi-plants on the targets of interest and enable repositioning of the plants and chemicals.","NA"

To better understand the mechanism, we used transgenic DC-LMP1/CD40 animals, which lack intestinal CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) and therefore cannot induce regulatory T (iTreg) cells due to a constitutive CD40-signal in CD11c+ cells.

We conducted an observational metagenomic study of the dynamics of interaction between Gordonia and their phages using a three-year data series of samples collected from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. The aim was to obtain a comprehensive picture of the coevolution dynamics in naturally evolving populations at relatively high time resolution.

Genome-wide analysis indicated low strain variability of Gordonia, and almost clonal conservation of the trailer end of the CRISPR loci. Incorporation of newer spacers gave rise to multiple coexisting bacterial populations. A host population containing a CRISPR array variant, which did not contain spacers against the coexisting phages, accounted for more than half of the total host abundance in the majority of samples.

The relative contribution of each process to the overall dissemination of carbapenem resistance in hospitals remains poorly understood.

This data was then utilized to focus further phenotypic evaluation of the role of CjNC110 in motility, autoagglutination, quorum sensing, hydrogen peroxide sensitivity and chicken colonization in C. jejuni. Inactivation of the CjNC110 ncRNA led to a statistically significant decrease in autoagglutination ability as well as increased motility and hydrogen peroxide sensitivity when compared to wild-type. Extracellular AI-2 detection was decreased in {triangleup}CjNC110, however, intracellular AI-2 accumulation was significantly increased, suggesting a key role of CjNC110 in modulating the transport of AI-2.

Currently, global HAT case numbers are reaching less than 1 case per 10,000 people in many disease foci. As such, there is a need for simple screening tools and strategies to replace active screening of the human population which can be maintained post-elimination for Gambian HAT and long-term Rhodesian HAT. Here we describe the development of a novel high-resolution melt assay for the xenomonitoring of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense in tsetse. Methods Primers for T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense were designed to target species-specific single copy genes. An additional primer set was included in the multiplex to determine if samples have sufficient genomic material for detecting low copy number targets. The assay was evaluated on 96 wild-caught tsetse previously identified to be positive for T. brucei s. l. of which two were infected with T. b. rhodesiense. Results The assay was found to be highly specific with no cross-reactivity with non-target trypanosome species and the assay limit of detection was 104 tryps/mL. HRM successfully identified three T. b. rhodesiense positive flies and was in agreement with the reference sub-species-specific PCRs. This assay provides an alternative to running multiple PCRs when screening for pathogenic sub-species of T. brucei s. l and produces results in ~2 hours, avoiding gel electrophoresis. Conclusions This method could provide a component of a simple and efficient method of screening large numbers of tsetse flies in known HAT foci or in areas at risk of recrudescence or threatened by the changing distribution of both forms of HAT.","NA"

Its receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacts with the human ACE2 receptor ensuring the entry of the viral genomes into the host cell. In this work, we report onthe differences in the binding of the RBD of the previous coronavirus SARS-CoV and of the newer 2019-nCoV coronavirus to the human ACE2 receptor using atomistic molecular dynamics techniques. Our results show major mutations in the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD occurring at the interface of RBD-ACE2 complex. These mutations make the 2019-nCoV RBD protein backbone much more flexible, hydrophobic interactions are reduced and additional polar/charged residues appear at the interface. We observe that higher flexibility of the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD leads to a bigger binding interface between the 2019-nCoV RBD and ACE2 and to about 20% more contacts between them in comparison with SARS-CoV. Taken together, the 2019-nCoV RBD shows more stable binding interface and higher binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor. The mutations not only stabilize the binding interface, they also lead to overall more stable 2019-nCoV RBD protein structure, even far from the binding interface.

Retrograde tracing with the lipophilic dye DiD suggests that the former derives from the thalamus, while the latter originates from a group of cells in the posterior hypothalamus that are located between the posterior tuberal nucleus and hypothalamic lobes. Two-photon calcium imaging indicates that blue light causes excitation of thalamic GABAergic neurons and terminals in the neuropil, while a subpopulation of lateral habenula neurons show reduced intracellular calcium levels. Whole-cell electrophysiological recording indicates that blue-light reduces membrane potential of lateral habenula neurons. These observations suggest that GABAergic input from the thalamus may mediate inhibition in the zebrafish lateral habenula. Mechanisms governing release of GABA from the neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, which are likely to be in the tuberomammillary nucleus, remain to be defined.","NA"

Substantial evidence supports the prevailing notion that plants possess a two-tiered innate immune system, called pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). PTI is triggered by microbial patterns via cell surface-localized pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), whereas ETI is activated by pathogen effector proteins via mostly intracellularly-localized receptors called nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs). PTI and ETI have traditionally been considered to act independently and have evolved sequentially. Here we show that, contrary to the perception of PTI and ETI being separate immune signaling pathways, Arabidopsis PRR/co-receptor mutants, fls2/efr/cerk1 and bak1/bkk1/cerk1 triple mutants, are greatly impaired in ETI responses when challenged with incompatible Pseudomonas syrinage bacteria. We further show that the NADPH oxidase (RBOHD)-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a critical early signaling event connecting PRR and NLR cascades and that PRR-mediated phosphorylation of RBOHD is necessary for full activation of RBOHD during ETI. Furthermore, NLR signaling rapidly augments the transcript and protein levels of key PTI components at an early stage and in a salicylic acid-independent manner. Our study supports an alternative model in which PTI is in fact an indispensable component of ETI during bacterial infection, implying that ETI halts pathogen infection, in part, by directly co-opting the anti-pathogen mechanisms proposed for PTI. This alternative model conceptually unites two major immune signaling pathways in the plant kingdom and mechanistically explains the long-observed similarities in downstream defense outputs between PTI and ETI.","NA"

Despite impressive progress, however, the scaling necessary in order to achieve greater computational power has been hampered by many constraints, including repressor toxicity and the lack of large sets of mutually-orthogonal repressors. As a consequence, a typical circuit contains no more than roughly seven repressor-based gates per cell. A possible way around this scalability problem is to distribute the computation among multiple cell types, which communicate among themselves using diffusible small molecules (DSMs) and each of which implements a small sub-circuit. Examples of DSMs are those employed by quorum sensing systems in bacteria. This paper focuses on systematic ways to implement this distributed approach, in the context of the evaluation of arbitrary Boolean functions. The unique characteristics of genetic circuits and the properties of DSMs require the development of new Boolean synthesis methods, distinct from those classically used in electronic circuit design. In this work, we propose a fast algorithm to synthesize distributed realizations for any Boolean function, under constraints on the number of gates per cell and the number of orthogonal DSMs. The method is based on an exact synthesis algorithm to find the minimal circuit per cell, which in turn allows us to build an extensive database of Boolean functions up to a given number of inputs. For concreteness, we will specifically focus on circuits of up to 4 inputs, which might represent, for example, two chemical inducers and two light inputs at different frequencies. Our method shows that, with a constraint of no more than seven gates per cell, the use of a single DSM increases the total number of realizable circuits by at least 7.58-fold compared to centralized computation. Moreover, when allowing two DSM's, one can realize 99.995% of all possible 4-input Boolean functions, still with at most 7 gates per cell. The methodology introduced here can be readily adapted to complement recent genetic circuit design automation software.","NA"

The majority of cases are caused by mutations in type I collagen, or by mutations that affect collagen processing and/or modification. Like bone, the extracellular matrix of tendons and ligaments is largely made up of type I collagen; however, despite the fact that a subset of OI patients presents with joint hypermobility, how tendon/ligament dysfunction contributes to this is unknown. Here, we performed a detailed phenotypic characterization of the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendon, Achilles tendon and patellar ligament in the Crtap mutant mouse model of severe, recessive OI. Stable, pyridinoline collagen cross-links were increased by 5- to 10-fold in mutant tendons and ligaments. Collagen fibril size in all three structures was also smaller in Crtap-/- mice compared to wildtype or heterozygous littermates. Together, these ultrastructural and biochemical changes resulted in thinner tendons and ligaments with increased cellularity compared to controls, as assessed by histology. To examine how alterations in tendons might affect motor function, we performed a battery of behavioral assays. During open field assessment, Crtap-/- exhibited reduced horizontal and vertical activity. Crtap-/- mice also exhibited motor impairments on the rotarod and grid footslip tests. In addition, Crtap-/- mice had reduced grip strength and displayed reduced time on the inverted grid test, indicating that they are weaker than wildtype and heterozygous mice. In summary, these data demonstrate that the tendons/ligaments of Crtap-/- mice are pathologically altered compared to wildtype - a phenotype that correlates with motor deficits and grip strength impairments. As such, Crtap-/- mice provide a preclinical model with which to examine downstream mechanisms and therapies pertaining to tendon/ligament pathology and motor dysfunction for OI patients.","NA"

TMPRSS2 is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites, Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816. The present study aims to investigate the conformational details of complex between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in order to discern the finer details of the priming of viral spike and to point candidate drug targets. Briefly, full length structural model of TMPRSS2 was developed and docked against the resolved structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites. The docking simulations showed that TMPRSS2 interacts with the two different loops of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, each containing different cleavage sites. Key functional residues of TMPRSS2 (His296, Ser441 and Ser460) were found to interact with immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared to the N-terminal cleavage site (Arg685/Ser686), TMPRSS2 region that interact with C-terminal cleavage site (Arg815/Ser816) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was predicted as relatively more druggable.

We found PBRM1 directly binds the a-Tub-K40me3 mark on tubulin, and localizes to the mitotic spindle and spindle pole during cell division. PBRM1 can assemble a PBAF complex in the absence of chromatin as revealed by mass spectrometry, and can recruit other PBAF complex components including SMARCA4 and ARID2 to a-tubulin. In addition to PBRM1, other PBAF components were also localized to the mitotic spindle and spindle pole.

Furthermore, there is a high correlation between aberrant nuclear positioning and poor muscle function. Although many genes that regulate nuclear movement have been identified, the mechanisms by which these genes act is not known. Using Drosophila melanogaster muscle development as a model system, and a combination of live-embryo microscopy and laser ablation of nuclei, we have found that phenotypically similar mutants are based in different molecular disruptions. Specifically, ensconsin (Drosophila MAP7) regulates the number of growing microtubules that are used to move nuclei whereas bocksbeutel (Drosophila emerin) and klarsicht (Drosophila KASH-protein regulate interactions between nuclei.","NA"

Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are sufficient to support Th17 cell differentiation in mouse, but the molecular and cellular requirements for this process remain incompletely characterized. Here we show that intestine-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) are the dominant site of SFB-induced intestinal Th17 cell differentiation. Subsequent migration of these cells to the intestinal lamina propria is dependent on their up-regulation of integrin {beta}7. Stat3-dependent induction of ROR{gamma}t, the Th17 cell-specifying transcription factor, largely depends on IL-6, but signaling through the receptors for IL-21 and IL-23 can compensate for absence of IL-6 to promote SFB-directed Th17 cell differentiation.

To address this need, we previously developed a plasmid-based, replication-incompetent DENV reporter virus particle (RVP) production system as an efficient and safe alternative to the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT). As part of the response to the 2015-2016 ZIKV outbreak, we recently developed pseudo-infectious ZIKV RVPs by modifying our DENV RVP system. The use of ZIKV RVPs as critical reagents in human clinical trials requires their further validation using stability and reproducibility metrics for large-scale applications. In the current study, we validated ZIKV RVPs using infectivity, neutralization, and enhancement assays with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and human ZIKV-positive patient serum. ZIKV RVPs are antigenically identical to live virus based on binding ELISA and neutralization results and are nonreplicating based on the results of plaque formation assays. We demonstrate reproducible neutralization titer data (NT50 values) across different RVP production lots, volumes, time frames, and laboratories. We also show RVP stability across experimentally relevant time intervals and temperatures. Our results demonstrate that ZIKV RVPs provide a safe, rapid, and reproducible reagent for large-scale, long-term studies of neutralizing antibodies and sera, which can facilitate large-scale screening and epidemiological studies to help expedite ZIKV vaccine development.","NA"

Here, we demonstrated that combined with multi-layer training set strategy, a neural-network-based algorithm Cellbow can achieve accurate and robust segmentation of cells in broad and general settings. It can also facilitate long-term tracking of cell growth and division. Furthermore, Cellbow is customizable and generalizable. It is broadly applicable to segmenting fluorescent images of diverse cell types with no further training needed. For bright- field images, only a small set of sample images of the specific cell type from the user may be needed for training.

Here, as a contrast, we describe UK Biobank GWAS results for three molecular traits--urate, IGF-1, and testosterone--that are biologically simpler than most diseases, and for which we know a great deal in advance about the core genes and pathways. Unlike most GWAS of complex traits, for all three traits we find that most top hits are readily interpretable. We observe huge enrichment of significant signals near genes involved in the relevant biosynthesis, transport, or signaling pathways. We show how GWAS data illuminate the biology of variation in each trait, including insights into differences in testosterone regulation between females and males. Meanwhile, in other respects the results are reminiscent of GWAS for more-complex traits. In particular, even these molecular traits are highly polygenic, with most of the variance coming not from core genes, but from thousands to tens of thousands of variants spread across most of the genome.

Participants completed a task in which items could be conferred positive or negative value based on schematic associations (i.e. schema value), or learned directly from experience via deterministic feedback (i.e. experienced value). We found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity correlated with the influence of both experience- and schema-based values on participants' decisions. Connectivity between vmPFC and middle temporal cortex also tracked the inferred value of items based on schematic associations on the first presentation of ingredients, prior to any feedback. In contrast, the striatum responded to participants' willingness to bet on ingredients as a function of the unsigned strength of their memory for those options' values.

The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion domains, is essential for the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals, which considered as the potential target organ of the virus. However, report about the expression of FURIN and ACE2 in oral tissues was limited. Methods: In order to investigate the potential infective channel of new coronavirus in oral cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and FURIN that mediate the new coronavirus entry into host cells in oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining experiment was performed to confirm the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in the protein level. Results: The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. IHC experiments revealed that both the ACE2-positive and FURIN-positive cells in the target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in fibroblasts, which further confirm the bioinformatics results. Conclusions: Based on these findings, we speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease. Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, which provides valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life.","NA"

Methods: To evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome, we used the recently established rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease. Two groups of six rhesus macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with intravenous remdesivir or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily. Clinical, virological and histological parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at necropsy to determine treatment efficacy. Results: In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs. Virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages were significantly reduced as early as 12hrs after the first treatment was administered. At necropsy on day 7 after inoculation, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were significantly lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue.

Given the rapid emergence of this pathogen, little is known about its genetic variation, immune system interactions, population prevalence, and environmental distribution. As a result, there is a pressing clinical and public health need for scalable molecular technologies that can rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and robustly interrogate strain evolution and host response in patients. To address these challenges, we designed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection within 30 minutes of application, including directly from lysed cells. Simultaneously, we developed a large-scale host and viral transcriptomic profiling platform that employs total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

High SARS-Cov2 viral titers were associated with distinct host transcriptional responses, including activation of the ACE2 gene and interferon response genes (e.g., IFIT1). Since ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) can also increase ACE2 expression, outcomes for patients taking ACEIs were examined, and showed a significantly increased risk of intubation and death. Our results demonstrate the utility of two molecular diagnostic platforms in defining the genetic features of an evolving global pandemic and provide insights that can aid future COVID-19 diagnostics, public health monitoring, and therapeutic options.","NA"

However, ESCRT association with the membrane is also mediated by electrostatic interactions with anionic phospholipids. Phospholipid distribution within natural biomembranes is inhomogeneous due to, for example, the formation of lipid rafts and curvature-driven lipid sorting. Here, we have used phase-separated giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to investigate the link between phosphatidylserine (PS)-rich lipid domains and ESCRT activity. We employ GUVs composed of phase separating lipid mixtures, where unsaturated DOPS and saturated DPPS lipids are incorporated individually or simultaneously to enhance PS localisation in liquid disordered (Ld) and/or liquid ordered (Lo) domains, respectively. PS partitioning between the coexisting phases is confirmed by a fluorescent Annexin V probe. Ultimately, we find that ILV generation promoted by ESCRTs is significantly enhanced when PS lipids localise within Ld domains. However, the ILVs that form are rich in Lo lipids. We interpret this surprising observation as preferential recruitment of the Lo phase beneath the ESCRT complex due to its increased rigidity, where the Ld phase is favoured in the neck of the resultant buds to facilitate the high membrane curvature in these regions of the membrane during the ILV formation process. Ld domains offer lower resistance to membrane bending, demonstrating a mechanism by which the composition and mechanics of membranes can be coupled to regulate the location and efficiency of ESCRT activity.","NA"

While individual mediators of these processes have been investigated, interactions between these mediators remain less well defined. We previously identified a structural complex between receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met and {beta}1 integrin in metastases. Using novel cell culture and in vivo assays, we found that c-Met/{beta}1 complex induction promotes breast cancer intravasation and adhesion to the vessel wall, but does not increase extravasation. These effects may be driven by the ability of the c-Met/{beta}1 complex to increase mesenchymal and stem cell characteristics. Multiplex transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulated Wnt and hedgehog pathways after c-Met/{beta}1 complex induction. A {beta}1 integrin point mutation that prevented binding to c-Met reduced intravasation. OS2966, a therapeutic antibody disrupting c-Met/{beta}1 binding, decreased invasion and mesenchymal gene expression and morphology of breast cancer cells. Bone-seeking breast cancer cells exhibited higher c-Met/{beta}1 complex levels than parental controls and preferentially adhere to tissue-specific matrix. Patient bone metastases demonstrated higher c-Met/{beta}1 levels than brain metastases. Thus, the c-Met/{beta}1 complex drives breast cancer cell intravasation and preferential affinity for bone tissue-specific matrix. Pharmacological targeting of the complex may prevent metastases, particularly osseous metastases.","NA"

TRIM5 is best known as a species-specific restriction factor that directly inhibits the viral life cycle. Additionally, it is also a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) that activates inflammatory signaling. How TRIM5 carries out its multi-faceted actions in antiviral defense remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that proteins required for autophagy, a cellular self-digestion pathway, play an important role in TRIM5's function as a PRR. Genetic depletion of proteins involved in all stages of the autophagy pathway prevented TRIM5-driven expression of NF-{kappa}B and AP1 responsive genes. One of these genes is the preeminent antiviral cytokine interferon {beta} (IFN-{beta}), whose TRIM5-dependent expression was lost in cells lacking the autophagy proteins ATG7, BECN1, and ULK1. Moreover, we found that the ability of TRIM5 to stimulate IFN-{beta} expression in response to recognition of a TRIM5-restricted HIV-1 capsid mutant (P90A) was abrogated in cells lacking autophagy factors. Stimulation of human macrophage-like cells with the P90A virus protected them against subsequent infection with an otherwise resistant wild type HIV-1 in a manner requiring TRIM5, BECN1, and ULK1. Mechanistically, TRIM5 was attenuated in its ability to activate the kinase TAK1 in autophagy deficient cells, and both BECN1 and ATG7 contributed to the assembly of TRIM5-TAK1 complexes. These data demonstrate a non-canonical role for the autophagy machinery in assembling antiviral signaling complexes and demonstrate a role for autophagy in the establishment of a TRIM5-dependent antiviral state.","NA"

In this report, we characterize 58 variants in nine assays that examine multiple aspects of SYNGAP1 function. Specifically, we used multiplex phospho-flow cytometry to measure the impact of variants on pERK, pGSK3{beta} and pCREB and high-content imaging to examine their subcellular localization. We find variants ranging from complete loss-of-function (LoF) to wildtype (WT)-like in their ability to regulate pERK and pGSK3{beta}, while all variants retain at least partial ability to regulate pCREB. Interestingly, our assays reveal that a high percentage of variants located within the disordered domain of unknown function that makes up the C-terminal half of SYNGAP1 exhibited LoF, compared to the more well studied catalytic domain. Moreover, we find protein instability to be a major contributor to dysfunction only for two missense variants both located within the catalytic domain. Using high-content imaging, we find variants with nuclear enrichment/exclusion and aberrant nuclear speckle localization. These variants are primarily located within the C2 domain known to mediate membrane lipid interactions. We find that mislocalization is distinct from altered catalytic activity, highlighting multiple independent molecular mechanisms underlying variant dysfunction. Our multidimensional dataset allows clustering of variants based on functional phenotypes and provides high-confidence pathogenicity classification.","NA"

This stage is marked by the expression of Nkx6.1, a transcription factor with well understood downstream targets but with unclear upstream regulators. In hPSC differentiation, Nkx6.1 is strongly induced by nicotinamide, a derivative of vitamin B3, which has three known functions within a cell. Nicotinamide inhibits two classes of enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) and sirtuins. It also contributes to the cellular pool of nicotinamide adenosine deoxynucleotide (NAD+) after conversion in the nicotinamide salvage pathway. Induction of Nkx6.1 expression in pancreatic endocrine progenitors by nicotinamide was mimicked by 3 PARP inhibitors (PJ34, olaparib, NU1025). Small molecule inhibition of the nicotinamide salvage pathway reduced Nkx6.1 expression but not Pdx1 expression and caused alteration in NAD+/NADH ratio. Nkx6.1 expression was not affected by sirtuin inhibition. Metabolic profiling of differentiating pancreatic and endocrine progenitors showed that oxygen consumption increases as differentiation progresses, and that nicotinamide reduces oxygen consumption rate. Expression of Nkx6.1 and other beta cell related genes, including Ins2 and Pdx1 increased in mouse islets after exposure to nicotinamide. In summary, nicotinamide induced Nkx6.1 expression in differentiating human pancreatic endocrine progenitors through inhibition of the PARP family of enzymes. Nicotinamide administration was also associated with increased NAD+/NADH ratio, without affecting Nkx6.1 expression. Similarly, the association between nicotinamide and Nkx6.1 expression was also seen in isolated mouse islets. These observations show a link between the regulation of beta cell identity and the effectors of NAD+ metabolism, suggesting possible therapeutic targets in the field of diabetes.","NA"

The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is an environment-sensing transcription factor that contributes to vascular development, and has been implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. We hypothesized that AHR can affect atherosclerosis by regulating phenotypic modulation of SMC. Methods: We combined RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq and in-vitro assays in human coronary artery SMC (HCASMC), with single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), histology, and RNAscope in an SMC-specific lineage-tracing Ahr knockout mouse model of atherosclerosis to better understand the role of AHR in vascular disease. Results: Genomic studies coupled with functional assays in cultured HCASMC revealed that AHR modulates HCASMC phenotype and suppresses ossification in these cells. Lineage tracing and activity tracing studies in the mouse aortic sinus showed that the Ahr pathway is active in modulated SMC in the atherosclerotic lesion cap. Furthermore, scRNA-Seq studies of the SMC-specific Ahr knockout mice showed a significant increase in the proportion of modulated SMC expressing chondrocyte markers such as Col2a1 and Alpl, which localized to the lesion neointima. These cells, which we term 'chondromyocytes' (CMC), were also identified in the neointima of human coronary arteries. In histological analyses, these changes manifested as larger lesion size, increased lineage-traced SMC participation in the lesion, decreased lineage-traced SMC in the lesion cap, and increased alkaline phosphatase activity in lesions in the Ahr knockout compared to wild-type mice. We propose that AHR is likely protective based on these data and inference from human genetic analyses. Conclusion: Overall, we conclude that AHR promotes maintenance of lesion cap integrity and diminishes the disease related SMC-to-CMC transition in atherosclerotic tissues.","NA"

Alpha and beta isoforms exhibit different kinetics, ADP dissociates slower from actomyosin containing beta myosin isoform, therefore, beta myosin stays strongly bound to actin longer.

We validated this mechanism by showing that che-1 expression was resilient to induced transient CHE-1 depletion, while both expression of CHE-1 targets and ASE function were lost. We identified a 130 bp che-1 promoter fragment responsible for this resilience, with deletion of a homeodomain binding site in this fragment causing stochastic loss of ASE identity long after its determination. Because network architectures that support this mechanism are highly conserved in cell differentiation, it may explain stable cell fate maintenance in many systems.","NA"

Here, we found a substantial, albeit incomplete loss of liver sex bias in hepatocyte-specific STAT5a/STAT5b (collectively, STAT5)-deficient mouse liver. In male liver, many male-biased genes were down regulated in direct association with the loss of STAT5 binding; many female-biased genes, which show low STAT5 binding, were de-repressed, indicating an indirect mechanism for repression by STAT5. Extensive changes in CpG-methylation were seen in STAT5-deficient liver, where sex differences in DNA methylation were abolished at 88% of ~1,500 differentially-methylated regions, largely due to an increase in methylation at the hypomethylated sites. STAT5-dependent CpG-hypomethylation was rarely found at proximal promoters of STAT5-dependent genes. Rather, STAT5 primarily regulated the methylation of distal enhancers, where STAT5 deficiency induced widespread hypermethylation at genomic regions enriched for accessible chromatin, enhancer histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K27ac), STAT5 binding, and DNA motifs for STAT5 and other transcription factors implicated in liver sex differences. In conclusion, the sex-dependent binding of STAT5 to liver chromatin is closely linked to sex-dependent demethylation of distal regulatory elements mapping to STAT5-dependent genes important for liver sex bias.","NA"

These mice survived postnatally, but had significant defects in bones and teeth, including reduced mineralization and short roots. H&E staining revealed reduced axon-like structures in the mutant mice. Reporter imaging demonstrated that Osterix-Cre activity was localized within the tooth and was active in the DP and derivatives, but not in neurons. Previous research has established that paracrine signals from the dental pulp attract trigeminal axons toward and into the tooth during postnatal development, yet very little is known about the signals that regulate tooth innervation. Immunofluorescent staining for a neuronal marker, {beta}3 tubulin, was performed on serial cryosections from control and mutant molars at two different postnatal stages. Confocal imaging and pixel quantification of {beta}3 tubulin demonstrated reduced innervation in P7 and P24 Tgfbr2cko first molars compared to controls, indicating that the signals necessary to promote neurite outgrowth were disrupted by Tgfbr2 deletion. Quantitative real time PCR showed that the mRNA expression levels of several neuronal genes were reduced. Lastly, trigeminal neurons were co-cultured atop Transwell filters overlying primary Tgfbr2f/f DP cells. Tgfbr2 in the DP was deleted with an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase. Confocal imaging of axons through the filter pores showed increased axonal sprouting from neurons cultured in the presence of Tgfbr2-positive DP cells compared to neurons cultured alone. Further, axon sprouting was reduced when Tgfbr2 was knocked down in the DP cells. These results indicate that Tgfbr2 in the DP mesenchyme regulates paracrine signals that guide sensory innervation of the tooth.","NA"

One unique feature of HS is the development of keratinized sinus tracts that grow extensively deep in the dermis and are highly immunogenic. Here, we demonstrated that the stem cell fate infidelity exists in the HS sinus tracts, which exhibit features of both surface epidermis and appendages. Using single cell transcriptome analyses, we finely dissected different compartments of the HS epithelium and identified their respective changes in cytokine expression during disease progression and the critical interactions with the immune cells. Together, our work provides advanced understanding of the pathological epidermal remodeling and important implications for HS therapeutics.","NA"

Estimating h2 in free-ranging populations is challenging due to the need for pedigrees; genomic-relatedness matrices (GRMs) circumvent this need and can be implemented in nearly any system where phenotypic and SNP data are available. We estimated the heritability of five body and three antler traits in a free-ranging population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada. We generated GRMs from >10,000 SNPs: dressed body mass and peroneus muscle mass had moderate h2 values of 0.49 and 0.56, respectively. Heritability in male-only antler features ranged from 0.00 to 0.51 and had high standard errors. We explored the influence of minor allele frequency and data completion filters on h2: GRMs derived from fewer SNPs had reduced h2 estimates and the relatedness coefficients significantly deviated from those generated with more SNPs. As a corollary, we discussed limitations to the application of GRMs in the wild, notably how skewed GRMs increase variance around h2 estimates. This is the first study to estimate h2 on a free-ranging population of white-tailed deer and should be informative for breeding designs and management.","NA"

While RNA sequencing and single cell RNA sequencing analysis provided important insights in the gene expression dynamics of T cells, it is not well understood how the mRNA expression translates into the protein landscape. By combining paired RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry data of primary human CD8+ T cells, we found that mRNA expression is a poor proxy for the overall protein output. Irrespective of the differentiation or activation status, the correlation coefficient of human CD8+ T cells reached a mere 0.41-0.43. Only gene classes that mediate conserved cellular processes such as protein translation or cellular metabolism showed a strong correlation of mRNA with protein expression. In contrast, the mRNA expression and protein output of transcription factors, cell surface molecules, and secreted proteins - including cytokines - only mildly correlated. Conversely, highly conserved genes correlated well with the protein output. This was also true for the presence of AU-rich elements in the 3'untranslated region, in particular for mRNAs that encode secreted proteins. In conclusion, the in-depth characterization of the transcriptome and proteome in human CD8+ T cells emphasizes the need of combined mRNA and protein analysis for our understanding of T cell biology and function.","NA"

TRPM3 mutations in humans were recently reported to be associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy; the functional effects of those mutations however were not reported. Here we show that both disease-associated mutations of TRPM3 render the channel overactive, but likely via different mechanisms. The Val to Met substitution in the S4-S5 loop induced a larger increase in basal activity and agonist sensitivity at room temperature than the Pro to Gln substitution in the extracellular segment of S6. In contrast, heat activation was increased more by the S6 mutant than by the S4-S5 segment mutant. Both mutants were inhibited by the TRPM3 antagonist primidone, suggesting a potential therapeutic intervention to treat this disease.","NA"

Previous studies of the tadpole lateral line system revealed that it may play a role in escape behaviour. In this study, we used DASPEI staining to reveal the location of tadpole lateral line neuromasts. Destroying these neuromasts with neomycin resulted in loss of escape responses in tadpoles. We then studied the physiology of anterior lateral line in immobilised tadpoles. Activating the neuromasts behind one eye could evoke asymmetrical motor nerve discharges when the tadpole was resting, suggestive of turning/escape, followed by fictive swimming. When the tadpole was already producing fictive swimming however, anterior lateral line activation reliably led to the termination of swimming. The anterior lateral line had spontaneous afferent discharges at rest, and when activated showed typical adaptation. There were also efferent activities during tadpole swimming, the activity of which was loosely in phase with ipsilateral motor nerve discharges, implying modulation by the motor circuit from the same side. Calcium imaging experiments located sensory interneurons in the primary anterior lateral line nucleus in the hindbrain. Future studies are needed to reveal how sensory information is processed by the central circuit to determine tadpole motor behaviour.","NA"

During development, progenitors within these regions are characterised by specific gene expression programs, contributing to the generation of diversity in postmitotic neurons and glia. While the region-specific molecular diversity of neurons and astrocytes is increasingly understood, whether these cells share region-specific programs remains unknown. Here, we show that in the neocortex and thalamus, neurons and astrocytes express shared region-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures. These signatures not only distinguish cells across brain regions but are also detected across substructures within regions, such as distinct thalamic nuclei, where clonal analysis revealed the existence of common nucleus-specific progenitors for neurons and glia. Consistent with their shared molecular signature, regional specificity was maintained following astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming. A detailed understanding of these regional-specific signatures may thus inform strategies for future cell-based brain repair.","NA"

  Networks","  Representation learning for Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is pivotal in
developing image-based systems to achieve higher precision in diagnostic
pathology. We propose a two-stage framework for WSI representation learning. We
sample relevant patches using a color-based method and use graph neural
networks to learn relations among sampled patches to aggregate the image
information into a single vector representation. We introduce attention via
graph pooling to automatically infer patches with higher relevance. We
demonstrate the performance of our approach for discriminating two sub-types of
lung cancers, Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) & Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC).
We collected 1,026 lung cancer WSIs with the 40$\times$ magnification from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, the largest public repository of
histopathology images and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.8% and AUC
of 0.89 on lung cancer sub-type classification by extracting features from a

  Chest X-rays","  We demonstrate use of iteratively pruned deep learning model ensembles for
detecting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection with chest X-rays
(CXRs). The disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus
(2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and a selection of
pretrained CNN models are trained on publicly available CXR collections to
learn CXR modality-specific feature representations and the learned knowledge
is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the
related task of classifying normal, bacterial pneumonia, and CXRs exhibiting
COVID-19 abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to
identify optimal number of neurons in the convolutional layers to reduce
complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the
best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble
strategies to improve classification performance. The custom and pretrained
CNNs are evaluated at the patient-level to alleviate issues due to information
leakage and reduce generalization errors. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly
improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs as compared to the
individual constituent models. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge
transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved
predictions. We expect that this model can be quickly adopted for COVID-19
screening using chest radiographs.

  Human-Robot Teaming","  Prior work on generating explanations has been focused on providing the
rationale behind the robot's decision making. While these approaches provide
the right explanations from the explainer's perspective, they fail to heed the
cognitive requirement of understanding an explanation from the explainee's
perspective. In this work, we set out to address this issue from a planning
context by considering the order of information provided in an explanation,
which is referred to as the progressiveness of explanations. Progressive
explanations contribute to a better understanding by minimizing the cumulative
cognitive effort required for understanding all the information in an
explanation. As a result, such explanations are easier to understand. Given the
sequential nature of communicating information, a general formulation based on
goal-based Markov Decision Processes for generating progressive explanation is
presented. The reward function of this MDP is learned via inverse reinforcement
learning based on explanations that are provided by human subjects. Our method
is evaluated in an escape-room domain. The results show that our progressive
explanation generation method reduces the cognitive load over two baselines.

This information is used in an object motion model describing the kinematic

  Outbreak","  We propose a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of some strains
of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, responsible for the cholera disease in
humans. We prove that, when the basic reproduction number is equal to one, a
transcritical bifurcation occurs for which the endemic equilibrium emanates
from the disease-free point. A control function is introduced into the model,
representing the distribution of chlorine water tablets for water purification.
An optimal control problem is then proposed and analyzed, where the goal is to
determine the fraction of susceptible individuals who should have access to
chlorine water tablets in order to minimize the total number of new infections
plus the total cost associated with the distribution of chlorine water tablets,
over the considered period of time. Finally, we consider real data of the
cholera outbreak in Yemen, from 27 April 2017 to 15 April 2018, choosing the
values of the parameters of the uncontrolled model that fit the real data.
Using our optimal control results, we show, numerically, that the distribution
of chlorine water tablets could have stopped, in a fast way, the worst cholera
outbreak that ever occurred in human history. Due to the critical situation of
Yemen, we also simulate the case where only a small percentage of susceptible
individuals has access to chlorine water tablets and obtain an optimal control
solution that decreases, substantially, the maximum number of infective
individuals attained at the outbreak.

  applications","  We initiate a study of the following problem: Given a continuous domain
$\Omega$ along with its convex hull $\mathcal{K}$, a point $A \in \mathcal{K}$
and a prior measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$, find the probability density over
$\Omega$ whose marginal is $A$ and that minimizes the KL-divergence to $\mu$.
This framework gives rise to several extremal distributions that arise in
mathematics, quantum mechanics, statistics, and theoretical computer science.
Our technical contributions include a polynomial bound on the norm of the
optimizer of the dual problem that holds in a very general setting and relies
on a ""balance"" property of the measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$, and exact algorithms
for evaluating the dual and its gradient for several interesting settings of
$\Omega$ and $\mu$. Together, along with the ellipsoid method, these results
imply polynomial-time algorithms to compute such KL-divergence minimizing
distributions in several cases. Applications of our results include: 1) an
optimization characterization of the Goemans-Williamson measure that is used to
round a positive semidefinite matrix to a vector, 2) the computability of the
entropic barrier for polytopes studied by Bubeck and Eldan, and 3) a
polynomial-time algorithm to compute the barycentric quantum entropy of a
density matrix that was proposed as an alternative to von Neumann entropy in
the 1970s: this corresponds to the case when $\Omega$ is the set of rank one
projections matrices and $\mu$ corresponds to the Haar measure on the unit
sphere. Our techniques generalize to the setting of Hermitian rank $k$
projections using the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber formula, and are applicable
even beyond, to adjoint orbits of compact Lie groups.

  $π^{-} \rightarrow π^{+} e^{-} e^{-}$ Amplitude","  Neutrinoless double beta decay (\( 0 \nu \beta \beta \)) is a hypothetical
nuclear decay mode with important implications. In particular, observation of
this decay would demonstrate that the neutrino is a Majorana particle and that
lepton number conservation is violated in nature. Relating experimental
constraints on \(0 \nu \beta \beta\) decay rates to the neutrino masses
requires theoretical input in the form of non-perturbative nuclear matrix
elements which remain difficult to calculate reliably. This work marks a first
step toward providing a general lattice QCD framework for computing
long-distance \(0 \nu \beta \beta\) matrix elements in the case where the decay
is mediated by a light Majorana neutrino. The relevant formalism is developed
and then tested by computing the simplest such matrix element describing an
unphysical \( \pi^{-} \rightarrow \pi^{+} e^{-} e^{-} \) transition on a series
of domain wall fermion ensembles. The resulting lattice data is then fit to
next-to-leading-order chiral perturbation theory, allowing a fully-controlled
extraction of the low energy constant governing the transition rate,
\(g_{\nu}^{\pi \pi}(\mu = 770 \,\, \mathrm{MeV}) = -10.78(12)_{\rm

complicated processes, such as the phenomenologically important \(n^{0} n^{0}

  Capsule Networks","  Radiographic images offer an alternative method for the rapid screening and
monitoring of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. This approach is
limited by the shortage of radiology experts who can provide a timely
interpretation of these images. Motivated by this challenge, our paper proposes
a novel learning architecture, called Detail-Oriented Capsule Networks
(DECAPS), for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from Computed Tomography (CT)
scans. Our network combines the strength of Capsule Networks with several
architecture improvements meant to boost classification accuracies. First,
DECAPS uses an Inverted Dynamic Routing mechanism which increases model
stability by preventing the passage of information from non-descriptive
regions. Second, DECAPS employs a Peekaboo training procedure which uses a
two-stage patch crop and drop strategy to encourage the network to generate
activation maps for every target concept. The network then uses the activation
maps to focus on regions of interest and combines both coarse and fine-grained
representations of the data. Finally, we use a data augmentation method based
on conditional generative adversarial networks to deal with the issue of data
scarcity. Our model achieves 84.3% precision, 91.5% recall, and 96.1% area
under the ROC curve, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We
compare the performance of the DECAPS model with three experienced,
well-trained thoracic radiologists and show that the architecture significantly
outperforms them. While further studies on larger datasets are required to
confirm this finding, our results imply that architectures like DECAPS can be
used to assist radiologists in the CT scan mediated diagnosis of COVID-19.

not necessarily identically distributed) from the others, and then assigned a
random weight. When the mean degree of such a graph is low, it is known that
the spectrum of the adjacency matrix $A$ deviates significantly from that of
its expected value $\mathbb E A$. In contrast, we show that over a wide range
of parameters the top eigenvalues of the non-backtracking matrix $B$ -- a
matrix whose powers count the non-backtracking walks between two edges -- are
close to those of $\mathbb E A$, and all other eigenvalues are confined in a
bulk with known radius. We also obtain a precise characterization of the scalar
product between the eigenvectors of $B$ and their deterministic counterparts
derived from the model parameters. This result has many applications, in
domains ranging from (noisy) matrix completion to community detection, as well
as matrix perturbation theory. In particular, we establish as a corollary that
a result known as the Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e phase transition, previously
established only for rotationally invariant random matrices, holds more
generally for matrices $A$ as above under a mild concentration hypothesis.

code is in MATLAB and it is straightforward to set up the model to run our
code. The frequency-domain calculation is advantageous to study the long-term
elastic response of a celestial body due to a cyclic force such as the tidal
force with no numerical dispersion issue suffered by many other methods
requiring volume meshing. Our AstroSeis has been benchmarked with other methods
such as normal modes summation and the direct solution method (DSM). This

  Quasar Luminosity Function","  The Quasar Luminosity Function (QLF) offers insight into the early
co-evolution of black holes and galaxies. It has been characterized
observationally up to redshift $z\sim6$ with clear evidence of a double
power-law shape, in contrast to the Schechter-like form of the underlying
dark-matter halo mass function. We investigate a physical origin for the
difference in these distributions by considering the impact of stochasticity
induced by the processes that determine the quasar luminosity for a given host
halo and redshift. We employ a conditional luminosity function and construct
the relation between median quasar magnitude versus halo mass
$M_{UV,\rm{c}}(M_{\rm{h}})$ with log-normal in luminosity scatter $\Sigma$, and
duty-cycle $\epsilon_{\rm{DC}}$, and focus on high redshift $z\gtrsim4$. We
show that, in order to reproduce the observed QLF, the $\Sigma=0$ abundance
matching requires all of the brightest quasars to be hosted in the rarest most
massive dark-matter halos (with an increasing $M_{UV,\rm{c}}/M_{\rm{h}}$ in
halo mass). Conversely, for $\Sigma>0$ the brightest quasars can be
over-luminous outliers hosted in relatively common dark-matter halos. In this
case, the median quasar magnitude versus halo mass relation, $M_{UV,\rm{c}}$,
flattens at the high-end, as expected in self-regulated growth due to feedback.
We sample the parameter space of $\Sigma$ and $\epsilon_{\rm{DC}}$ and show
that $M_{UV,\rm{c}}$ flattens above $M_{\rm{h}}\sim 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ for
$\epsilon_{\rm{DC}}<10^{-2}$. Models with $\epsilon_{\rm{DC}}\sim1$ instead
require a high mass threshold close to $M_{\rm{h}}\gtrsim10^{13}M_{\odot}$. We
investigate the impact of $\epsilon_{\rm{DC}}$ and $\Sigma$ on measurements of
clustering and find there is no luminosity dependence on clustering for
$\Sigma>0.3$, consistent with recent observations from Subaru HSC.

assembling geometric primitives into a combinatorial configuration. In this
work, we propose a new 3D shape generation algorithm that aims to create such a
combinatorial configuration from a set of volumetric primitives. To tackle the
exponential growth of feasible combinations in terms of the number of
primitives, we adopt sequential model-based optimization. Our method
sequentially assembles primitives by exploiting and exploring adequate regions
that are constrained by the current primitive placements. The evaluation
function conveys global structure guidance for the assembling process to
follow. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully generates
combinatorial objects and simulates more realistic generation processes. We
also introduce a new dataset for combinatorial 3D shape generation.

KTaO$_3$ and insulating overlayers of either EuO or LaAlO$_3$. The
superconducting transition temperature, approaching 2.2 K, is about one order
of magnitude higher than that of the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ system. Strikingly,
similar electron gases at (001) KTaO$_3$ interfaces remain normal down to 25
mK. The critical field and current-voltage measurements indicate that the
superconductivity is two dimensional. Higher mobility EuO/KTaO$_3$ (111)
samples show a large in-plane anisotropy in transport properties at low
temperatures prior to onset of superconductivity, suggesting the emergence of a
stripe like phase where the superconductivity is nearly homogeneous in one
direction, but strongly modulated in the other.

  on Quantum Computers","  Simulation of the dynamics of quantum materials is emerging as a promising
scientific application for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.
Due to their high gate-error rates and short decoherence times, however, NISQ
computers can only produce high-fidelity results for those quantum circuits
smaller than some given circuit size. Dynamic simulations, therefore, pose a
challenge as current algorithms produce circuits that grow in size with each
subsequent time-step of the simulation. This underscores the crucial role of
quantum circuit compilers to produce executable quantum circuits of minimal
size, thereby maximizing the range of physical phenomena that can be studied
within the NISQ fidelity budget. Here, we present two domain-specific quantum
circuit compilers for the Rigetti and IBM quantum computers, specifically
designed to compile circuits simulating dynamics under a special class of
time-dependent Hamiltonians. The compilers outperform state-of-the-art
general-purpose compilers in terms of circuit size reduction by around 25-30%
as well as wall-clock compilation time by around 40% (dependent on system size
and simulation time-step). Drawing on heuristic techniques commonly used in
artificial intelligence, both compilers scale well with simulation time-step
and system size. Code for both compilers is included to enhance the results of
dynamic simulations for future researchers. We anticipate that our
domain-specific compilers will enable dynamic simulations of quantum materials
on near-future NISQ computers that would not otherwise be possible with
general-purpose compilers.

This matrix model has the same form as the one that appears when the replica
trick is applied to the spherical $p$-spin model for spin glasses, but our case
has different ranges of variables and parameters from the spin glass case. We
analyze the matrix model analytically and numerically. We show some evidences

we obtain solutions of the linearized ghost-free equations for stationary

In four dimensions, when the scale non-locality $\ell$ tends to zero, the

non-toxicity and low cost. However, owing to the wide band gap, these can be
utilized only in the UV region. Thus, it's necessary to expand their optical
response in visible region by reducing their band gap through doping with
metals, nonmetals or the combination of different elements, while retaining
intact the photocatalytic efficiency. We report here, the codoping of a metal
and a nonmetal in anatase TiO$_2$ and SrTiO$_3$ for efficient photocatalytic
water splitting using hybrid density functional theory and \textit{ab initio}
atomistic thermodynamics. The latter ensures to capture the environmental
effect to understand thermodynamic stability of the charged defects at a
realistic condition. We have observed that the charged defects are stable in
addition to neutral defects in anatase TiO$_2$ and the codopants act as donor
as well as acceptor depending on the nature of doping (p-type or n-type).
However, the most stable codopants in SrTiO$_3$ mostly act as donor. Our
results reveal that despite the response in visible light region, the codoping
in TiO$_2$ and SrTiO$_3$ cannot always enhance the photocatalytic activity due
to either the formation of recombination centers or the large shift in the

Remote ID systems for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These systems act as
license plates used on automobiles, but they transmit information using radio
waves. To be useful, the transmissions in such systems need to reach long
distances to minimize the number of ground stations to capture these
transmissions. LoRaWAN is designed as a cheap long-range technology to be used
for long-range communication for the Internet of Things. Several manufacturers
make LoRaWAN modules, which are readily available on the market and are,
therefore, ideal for the UAVs Remote IDs at a low cost. In this paper, we
present our experiences in using LoRaWAN technology as a communication
technology. Our experiments to identify and locate the UAV systems uncovered
several issues of using LoRaWAN in such systems that are documented in this
paper. Using several ground stations, we can determine the location of a UAV
equipped with a LoRaWAN module that transmits the UAV Remote ID. Hence, it can
help identify UAVs that unintentionally, or intentionally, fly into restricted
zones.

consequence, there are disruptions in human and economic activities all over
the globe. The recovery process is also expected to be rough. Economic
activities impact social behaviors, which leave signatures in satellite images
that can be automatically detected and classified. Satellite imagery can
support the decision-making of analysts and policymakers by providing a
different kind of visibility into the unfolding economic changes. Such
information can be useful both during the crisis and also as we recover from
it.
  In this work, we use a deep learning approach that combines strategic
location sampling and an ensemble of lightweight convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to recognize specific elements in satellite images and compute economic
indicators based on it, automatically. This CNN ensemble framework ranked third
place in the US Department of Defense xView challenge, the most advanced
benchmark for object detection in satellite images. We show the potential of
our framework for temporal analysis using the US IARPA Function Map of the
World (fMoW) dataset. We also show results on real examples of different sites
before and after the COVID-19 outbreak to demonstrate possibilities.
  Among the future work is the possibility that with a satellite image dataset
that samples a region at a weekly (or biweekly) frequency, we can generate more
informative temporal signatures that can predict future economic states. Our

reliability is an effective and popular technique to estimate the probability

  Scans of COVID-19 and COPD Patients","  Pulmonary lobe segmentation in computed tomography scans is essential for
regional assessment of pulmonary diseases. Automated segmentation is still an
open problem, especially for scans with substantial abnormalities, such as in
COVID-19 infection. Recent works used Convolutional Neural Networks for
automatic pulmonary lobe segmentation. Convolution kernels in these networks
only respond to local information within the scope of their effective receptive
field, and this may be insufficient to capture all necessary contextual
information. We argue that contextual information is critically important for
accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes, especially when the lungs are severely
affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a
contextual two-stage U-net (CTSU-Net) that leverages global context by
introducing a first stage in which the receptive field encompasses the entire
scan and by using a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module
computes the filter response at one position as a weighted sum of feature
responses at all positions, where geometric and visual correlations between
features determine weights. With a limited amount of training data available
from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and validate CTSU-Net on a cohort of
5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for
evaluation). Using models pretrained COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to
retrain and evaluate CTSU-Net on 204 COVID-19 subjects (104 for retraining and
100 for evaluation). Experimental results show that CTSU-Net outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and performs robustly on cases with incomplete
fissures and severe lung infection due to COVID-19.

properties of these surface diffeomorphisms dictate topological properties of
the corresponding knot. In this article we collect observations, conjectures,
and questions addressing this, from both the braid perspective and the fibered

  Interactions","  For noninteracting Weyl semimetals (WSMs), Fermi-arc surface states can arise
when there exist gapless Weyl nodes in the bulk single-particle spectrum.
However, in the presence of electronic correlations, it is not clear whether
this bulk-boundary correspondence still holds or not. Recently, novel
correlated phases are predicted to appear in WSMs with long-ranged
interactions, in which the bulk Weyl nodes can be gapped but without destroying
their topological properties. Here, we explore the fate of the Fermi-arc states
under the influence of such long-ranged interactions. After mapping the system
onto a one-dimensional interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with two
open ends, we employ numerical exact diagonalizations to address the issue
whether the Fermi-arc states will be modified. By extrapolating our data to the
thermodynamic limit, we find that the zero-energy edge states of the
corresponding SSH model still exist for those momenta giving the noninteracting
Fermi-arc states. Moreover, this observation applies to both the
single-particle and the collective edge excitations. Since the locus of these
edge states constitutes the Fermi arcs, the robustness of the Fermi-arc states
against long-ranged interactions is thus demonstrated. In particular, the Fermi
arcs of single-particle nature can survive even when the single-particle gaps
at the Weyl nodes are opened by interactions. Our results illustrate the
subtlety in identifying the topological phases of interacting WSMs and show the
limitation of the approaches simply by examining the nodal structure of the
single-particle spectrum.

of points, V and C, that lie in the same metric space, and our goal is to
choose a point in C whose total distance from the points in V is as small as
possible. However, rather than having access to the underlying distance metric,
we only know, for each point in V , a ranking of its distances to the points in
C. We propose algorithms that choose a point in C using only these rankings as
input and we provide bounds on their distortion (worst-case approximation
ratio). A prominent motivation for this problem comes from voting theory, where
V represents a set of voters, C represents a set of candidates, and the
rankings correspond to ordinal preferences of the voters. A major conjecture in
this framework is that the optimal deterministic algorithm has distortion 3. We
resolve this conjecture by providing a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves
distortion 3, matching a known lower bound. We do so by proving a novel lemma
about matching rankings of candidates to candidates, which we refer to as the
ranking-matching lemma. This lemma induces a family of novel algorithms, which
may be of independent interest, and we show that a special algorithm in this
family achieves distortion 3. We also provide more refined, parameterized,
bounds using the notion of {\alpha}-decisiveness, which quantifies the extent
to which a voter may prefer her top choice relative to all others. Finally, we
introduce a new randomized algorithm with improved distortion compared to known
results, and also provide improved lower bounds on the distortion of all

dynamical scaling relations in high-density environments. For these galaxies,
we successfully measured global galaxy properties, modeled stellar populations,
and created dynamical models, and support the results using detailed dynamical
models of 16 galaxies, including the two most massive cluster galaxies, using
data taken with the SAURON IFU. By design, the study provides minimal scatter
in derived scaling relations due to the small uncertainty in the relative
distances of galaxies compared to the cluster distance. Our results demonstrate
low ($\leq$55% for 90$^{th}$ percentile) dark matter fractions in the inner
1$R_{\rm e}$ ~of galaxies. Owing to the study design, we produce the tightest,
to our knowledge, IMF-$\sigma_e$ relation of galaxies, with a slope consistent
with that seen in local galaxies. Leveraging our dynamical models, we transform
the classical Fundamental Plane of the galaxies to the Mass Plane. We find that
the coefficients of the mass plane are close to predictions from the virial
theorem, and have significantly lower scatter compared to the Fundamental
plane. We show that Coma galaxies occupy similar locations in the (M$_*$ -
$R_{\rm e}$) and (M$_*$ - $\sigma_e$) relations as local field galaxies but are
older. This, and the fact we find only three slow rotators in the cluster, is
consistent with the scenario of hierarchical galaxy formation and expectations
of the kinematic morphology-density relation.

falsification. This makes it an interesting test case for social-scientific
theories of what motivates and mediates contemporary scientific research and
the nature of scientific objectivity. For our empirical investigation, we
conducted 50 semi-structured interviews with researchers in the rival camps of
String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity, coded a subset for reoccurring themes,
and subjected the resulting data to statistical analysis. Theoretically, we
mobilize aspects of Daston and Galison's depiction of the scientific self and
its relation to epistemic virtues, Pierre Bourdieu's field-centered account of
social space, and Kantian notions of aesthetics in order to delineate the
subjective tastes and the related process of collective consensus-making in
contemporary quantum gravity research. We make two key contributions. First,
our analysis sheds light on the inner workings of the field by connecting its
internal epistemic struggles with relevant social-scientific theories. For
example, we are able to suggest an explanation for how one approach, String
Theory, has become so dominant. Second, our application of theories of social
reproduction to the substance of scientific inquiry merits some substantive
generalizations to Daston and Galison's framework. Most significantly, we
propose as an addendum to their progression the notion of objectivity through
intersubjectivity: objectivity obtained not through the suppression of the self
but by its (regulated) pluralistic expression and performance.

observation of the quantum Cheshire cat effect, all such experiments are based

allowing simple interpretation due to measurement-induced disturbance and also
subject to trivial interpretation based on classical waves. In this work, we
report a genuine experimental observation of the quantum Cheshire cat effect
with noninvasive weak quantum measurement as originally proposed. The use of
the weak-measurement probe has allowed us to identify the location of the
single-photon and that of the disembodied polarization state in a quantum

respect a given inference budget, we propose a modification to contextual
representation fine-tuning which, during inference, allows for an early (and
fast) ""exit"" from neural network calculations for simple instances, and late
(and accurate) exit for hard instances. To achieve this, we add classifiers to
different layers of BERT and use their calibrated confidence scores to make
early exit decisions. We test our proposed modification on five different
datasets in two tasks: three text classification datasets and two natural

tradeoff in almost all cases, producing models which are up to five times
faster than the state of the art, while preserving their accuracy. Our method
also requires almost no additional training resources (in either time or

the need for costly retraining of multiple models at different levels of
efficiency; we allow users to control the inference speed/accuracy tradeoff
using a single trained model, by setting a single variable at inference time.

estimation method with high real-time performance also needs to improve its
accuracy due to the simple structure of the network model. It is currently
difficult to achieve both high accuracy and real-time performance in
single-person pose estimation. For use in human-machine cooperative operations,
this paper proposes a single-person upper limb pose estimation method based on
an end-to-end approach for accurate and real-time limb pose estimation. Using
the stacked hourglass network model, a single-person upper limb skeleton key
point detection model was designed.Deconvolution was employed to replace the
up-sampling operation of the hourglass module in the original model, solving
the problem of rough feature maps. Integral regression was used to calculate
the position coordinates of key points of the skeleton, reducing quantization
errors and calculations. Experiments showed that the developed single-person
upper limb skeleton key point detection model achieves high accuracy and that
the pose estimation method based on the end-to-end approach provides high
accuracy and real-time performance.

in mechanics. However, many of the investigations on this topic to date have
focused on peeling from substrates with flat surfaces. In this paper, we study
the problem of peeling an elastic thin film from a rigid substrate that has
periodic surface undulations. We allow for contact between the detached part of
the film with the substrate. We give analytical results for computing the
equilibrium force given the true peeling angle, which is the angle at which the
detached part of the film leaves the substrate. When there is no contact we
present explicit results for computing the true peeling angle from the
substrate's profile and for determining an equilibrium state's stability solely
from the substrate's surface curvature. The general results that we derive for
the case involving contact allow us to explore the regime of peeling at large
surface roughnesses. Our analysis of this regime reveals that the peel-off
force can be made to become independent of the peeling direction by roughening
the surface. This result is in stark contrast to results from peeling on flat
surfaces, where the peel-off force strongly depends on the peeling direction.
Our analysis also reveals that in the large roughness regime the peel-off force
achieves its theoretical upper bound, irrespective of the other particulars of
the substrate's surface profile.

there are two components to the outflow emission: a substantial contribution
from expanded plasma that appears to have been expelled from closed loops in
the active region core, and a second contribution from dynamic activity in
active region plage, with a composition signature that reflects solar
photospheric abundances. The two competing drivers of the outflows may explain
the variable composition of the slow solar wind.

lies in the incorporation of the instantaneous interference and the vertical
height of THz devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our
analysis and reveal that the coverage probability significantly decreases when
the transmission distance increases. We also show the increasing blocker
density and increasing AP density impose different impacts on the coverage
performance when the UE-AP link of interest is in line-of-sight. We further
show that the coverage performance improvement brought by increasing the
antenna directivity at APs is higher than that brought by increasing the

about a user's intended destination and route is crucial. For example,
suggestions for available parking spots close to the destination can be made or
ride-sharing opportunities along the route are facilitated. Our approach
predicts probable destinations and routes of a vehicle, based on the most
recent partial trajectory and additional contextual data. The approach follows
a three-step procedure: First, a $k$-d tree-based space discretization is
performed, mapping GPS locations to discrete regions. Secondly, a recurrent
neural network is trained to predict the destination based on partial sequences
of trajectories. The neural network produces destination scores, signifying the
probability of each region being the destination. Finally, the routes to the
most probable destinations are calculated. To evaluate the method, we compare
multiple neural architectures and present the experimental results of the
destination prediction. The experiments are based on two public datasets of
non-personalized, timestamped GPS locations of taxi trips. The best performing
models were able to predict the destination of a vehicle with a mean error of
1.3 km and 1.43 km respectively.

  eccentricity damping by planet-disc interactions based on dynamical friction","  During planet formation gravitational interaction between a planetary embryo
and the protoplanetary gas disc causes orbital migration of the planetary
embryo, which plays an important role in shaping the final planetary system.
While migration sometimes occurs in the supersonic regime, wherein the relative
velocity between the planetary embryo and the gas is higher than the sound
speed, migration prescriptions proposed thus far describing the planet-disc
interaction force and the timescales of orbital change in the supersonic regime
are inconsistent with one another. Here we discuss the details of existing
prescriptions in the literature and derive a new simple and intuitive
formulation for planet-disc interactions based on dynamical friction that can
be applied in both supersonic and subsonic cases. While the existing
prescriptions assume particular disc models, ours include the explicit
dependence on the disc parameters; hence it can be applied to discs with any
radial surface density and temperature dependence (except for the local
variations with radial scales less than the disc scale height). Our
prescription will reduce the uncertainty originating from different literature
formulations of planet migration and will be an important tool to study planet
accretion processes, especially when studying the formation of close-in
low-mass planets that are commonly found in exoplanetary systems.

probabilistic autoregressive generative model to score tracklet proposals by
directly measuring the likelihood that a tracklet represents natural motion.
One key property of our model is its ability to generate multiple likely

score tracklets but also effectively maintain existing tracklets when the
detector fails to detect some objects even for a long time, e.g., due to
occlusion, by sampling trajectories so as to inpaint the gaps caused by
misdetection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to
scoring and inpainting tracklets on several MOT benchmark datasets. We
additionally show the generality of our generative model by using it to produce
future representations in the challenging task of human motion prediction.

Moreover, complex scenes may need detailed geometric representation, requiring
many geometric primitives and a fast rendering operation. We propose to break
up the rendering process into multiple parts: (1) the scene representation, (2)
a differentiable geometry projection and (3) neural shading. While mature,
off-the-shelf models for scene representation and neural shading are widely
available, we propose pulsar as a general purpose differentiable geometry
engine tightly integrated with PyTorch. By replacing mesh representations with
sphere clouds for the scene representation, the operation is fast compared to
existing differentiable renderers and avoids problems with surface topology. It
provides gradients for the full scene parameterization, i.e., sphere positions,
colors, radiuses, opacity and the camera parameters. pulsar can execute many
times, up to orders of magnitudes faster than existing renderers and allows
real-time rendering and optimization of scenes with millions of spheres. It can
be used for 3D reconstruction, rendering and volumetric scene optimization.

We begin with a simplified model by discarding the effect of mutations, which

discuss the general model and its limitations. Our approach uses the
eigenelements of a formal limiting operator, that depend on the structuring

often requires additional human annotations (e.g., tens of thousands of labeled
instances) that are usually expensive and time-consuming to collect. Thus, a
crucial research question is how to obtain supervision in a cost-effective way.
In this paper, we introduce ""entity triggers"", an effective proxy of human
explanations for facilitating label-efficient learning of NER models. An entity
trigger is defined as a group of words in a sentence that helps to explain why
humans would recognize an entity in the sentence.
  We crowd-sourced 14k entity triggers for two well-studied NER datasets. Our
proposed model, named Trigger Matching Network, jointly learns trigger
representations and soft matching module with self-attention such that can
generalize to unseen sentences easily for tagging. Experiments show that the
framework is significantly more cost-effective such that using 20% of the
trigger-annotated sentences can result in a comparable performance of
conventional supervised approaches using 70% training data. We publicly release
the collected entity triggers and our code.

($r_p^-$) and retrograde radius ($r_p^+$), respectively, in the range $M\leq
r_p^-\leq 3M$ and $3M\leq r_p^+\leq 4M$, and always cast closed shadow
silhouette for $a\leq M$. For $a>M$, it is a no-horizon spacetime (naked
singularity) with prograde orbits spiral to end up in singularity and
retrograde orbits produce an arc like shadow with a dark spot at the center,
i.e., no closed shadow silhouette. We compare shadows cast by Kerr black holes
with those produced by three rotating regular spacetimes, viz. Bardeen, Hayward
and nonsingular, which are prototype non-Kerr black hole metrics with an
additional deviation parameter $g$ related to nonlinear electrodynamics charge.
It turns out that for a given $ a $, there exists a critical value of $ g $,
$g_E$ such that $\Delta=0$ has no zeros for $ g > g_E$, one double zero at $ r
= r_E $ if $ g = g_E $, respectively, corresponding to a no-horizon regular
spacetime and extremal black hole with degenerate horizon. We demonstrate,
unlike the Kerr black hole, no-horizon regular spacetimes can form closed
shadow silhouette when $g_E< g \leq g_c$, e.g., for $a=0.10M$, Bardeen
($g_E=0.763332M<g\leq g_c= 0.816792M$), Hayward ( $g_E=1.05297M < g\leq g_c =
1.164846M$) and nonsingular ($g_E=1.2020M < g \leq g_c= 1.222461M$) no-horizon
spacetimes cause closed shadow silhouette. These results confirm that the
existence of a closed shadow does not prove that the compact object is
necessarily a black hole. The circularity deviation parameter $\Delta C$ for
the three no-horizon rotating spacetime shadows satisfy $\Delta C\leq 0.10$ in
accordance with the observed shadow of M87* black hole. The case of Kerr-Newman
no-horizon spacetimes (naked singularities) with similar features is appended.

the strong field localization leads to the further increase of the SHG in the

for municipalities with a decent number of NFI plots, direct NFI estimates were
sometimes more precise than MA estimates. PS estimates were always more precise

systematic effect arising from the non-locality of the observed galaxy-galaxy

separation depends on the physical modeling on all scales internal to that
separation, systematic uncertainties in the modeling of non-linear small scales
are propagated outwards to larger scales. Even in the absence of other limiting
factors, this systematic effect alone can necessitate conservative small-scale
cuts, resulting in significant losses of information in the tangential shear
data vector. We construct a simple linear transformation of the observable that
removes this non-locality, enabling more aggressive small-scale cuts for a
given theoretical model. Our modified galaxy-galaxy lensing observable makes it
possible to include observations on significantly smaller scales than those
under the standard approach in cosmological analyses. More importantly, it
ensures that the cosmological signal contained within the observable is
exclusively drawn from well-understood physical scales.

so in agile software development teams which rely heavily on self-organisation

practitioners have advocated a strategy of mirroring system structure and
organisational structure, to simplify communication and coordination of
collaborative work. But what are the patterns of organisation found in practice
in agile software communities and how effective are those patterns? We address
these research questions using mixed-methods research in industry, that is,
interview surveys, focus-groups, and delphi studies of agile teams. In our
study of 30 agile software organisations we found that, out of 7 organisational
structure patterns that recur across our dataset, a single organisational
pattern occurs over 37% of the time. This pattern: (a) reflects young
communities (1-12 months old); (b) disappears in established ones (13+ months);
(c) reflects the highest number of architecture issues reported. Finally, we
observe a negative correlation between a proposed organisational measure and
architecture issues. These insights may serve to aid architects in designing
not only their architectures but also their communities to best support their
co-evolution.

classification impedes the ability to explain model predictions in an
interpretable way. Existing explanation methods generally create importance
rankings in terms of pixels or pixel groups. However, the resulting
explanations lack an optimal size, do not consider feature dependence and are
only related to one class. Counterfactual explanation methods are considered
promising to explain complex model decisions, since they are associated with a
high degree of human interpretability. In this paper, SEDC is introduced as a
model-agnostic instance-level explanation method for image classification to
obtain visual counterfactual explanations. For a given image, SEDC searches a
small set of segments that, in case of removal, alters the classification. As
image classification tasks are typically multiclass problems, SEDC-T is
proposed as an alternative method that allows specifying a target
counterfactual class. We compare SEDC(-T) with popular feature importance
methods such as LRP, LIME and SHAP, and we describe how the mentioned
importance ranking issues are addressed. Moreover, concrete examples and
experiments illustrate the potential of our approach (1) to obtain trust and
insight, and (2) to obtain input for model improvement by explaining
misclassifications.

separates the incoming beam ions into two groups. One component forms a
supersonic beam which is accelerated to an energy exceeding the energy of the

glitches as highlighted by LISA Pathfinder. In this paper, we use a surrogate
data approach to test the stationarity of a time series, with the goal of
identifying noise nonstationarities in the future LISA mission. This will be
necessary for determining how often the LISA noise power spectral density (PSD)
will need to be updated for parameter estimation routines. We conduct a
thorough simulation study illustrating the power/size of various versions of
the hypothesis tests, and then apply these approaches to differential
acceleration measurements from LISA Pathfinder. We also develop a data analysis
strategy for addressing nonstationarities in the LISA PSD, where we update the
noise PSD over time, while simultaneously conducting parameter estimation, with
a focus on planned data gaps. We show that assuming stationarity when noise is
nonstationary leads to systematic biases and large posterior variances in
parameter estimates for galactic white dwarf binary gravitational wave signals.

eccentricity. Methods: We investigate the binary trigger hypothesis in
longer-period (>20yr) binaries by carrying out three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the formation of low-mass binary
stars down to final separations of ~10AU, including the effects of gas
turbulence and magnetic fields. We run two simulations with an initial
turbulent gas core of one solar mass each and two different initial turbulent
Mach numbers, M = 0.1 and 0.2, for 6500yr after protostar formation. Results:
We observe bursts of accretion at periastron during the early stages when the
eccentricity of the binary system is still high. We find that this correlation
between bursts of accretion and passing periastron breaks down at later stages,
because of the gradual circularisation of the orbits. For eccentricities
greater than e=0.2, we observe episodic accretion triggered near periastron.
However, we do not find any strong correlation between the strength (the ratio
of the burst accretion ratio to the quiescent accretion rate) of episodic
accretion and eccentricity. We determine that accretion events are likely
triggered by torques between the rotation of the circumstellar disc and the
approaching binary stars. We compare our results with observational data of
episodic accretion in short-period binaries and find good agreement between our
simulations and the observations. Conclusions: We conclude that episodic
accretion is a universal mechanism operating in eccentric young binary-star
systems, independent of separation, and should be observable in long-period
binaries as well as in short-period binaries, but that the strength will depend
on the torques, and hence the separation at periastron.

developers' productivity, the research on the claimed effects of TDD has so far
shown inconclusive results. Some researchers have ascribed these inconclusive
results to the negative affective states that TDD would provoke. A previous
(baseline) experiment has, therefore, studied the affective reactions of
(novice) developers---i.e., 29 third-year undergraduates in Computer Science
(CS)---when practicing TDD to implement software. To validate the results of
the baseline experiment, we conducted a replicated experiment that studies the
affective reactions of novice developers when applying TDD to develop software.
Developers in the treatment group carried out a development task using TDD,
while those in the control group used a non-TDD approach. To measure the
affective reactions of developers, we used the Self-Assessment Manikin
instrument complemented with a liking dimension. The most important differences
between the baseline and replicated experiments are: (i) the kind of novice
developers involved in the experiments---third-year vs. second-year
undergraduates in CS from two different universities; and (ii) their
number---29 vs. 59. The results of the replicated experiment do not show any
difference in the affective reactions of novice developers. Instead, the
results of the baseline experiment suggest that developers seem to like TDD
less as compared to a non-TDD approach and that developers following TDD seem
to like implementing code less than the other developers, while testing code
seems to make them less happy.

axial anomaly the electric current in a system consisting of interacting
fermions and gauge field with chirality imbalance that is put into a strong
external magnetic field. Experimental search of the magnetically induced
current in QCD in heavy ion collisions above a pseudocritical temperature
hints, though not yet conclusive, that the induced current is either small or
vanishing. This would imply that the chirality imbalance in QCD above $T_c$
that could be generated via topological fluctuations is at most very small.
Here we present the most general reason for absence (smallness) of the
chirality imbalance in QCD above Tc. It was recently found on the lattice that
QCD above Tc is approximately chiral spin (CS) symmetric with the symmetry
breaking at the level of a few percent. The CS transformations mix the right-
and left-handed components of quarks. Then an exact CS symmetry would require
absence of any chirality imbalance. Consequently an approximate CS symmetry
admits at most a very small chirality imbalance in QCD above Tc. Hence the
absence or smallness of an magnetically induced current observed in heavy ion
collisions could be considered as experimental evidence for emergence of the CS
symmetry above Tc.

due to the increasing concerns around DeepFakes. Since the initial DeepFake
databases from the 1st generation such as UADFV and FaceForensics++ up to the
latest databases of the 2nd generation such as Celeb-DF and DFDC, many visual
improvements have been carried out, making fake videos almost indistinguishable
to the human eye. This study provides an exhaustive analysis of both 1st and
2nd DeepFake generations in terms of facial regions and fake detection
performance. Two different approaches are considered in our experimental
framework: i) selecting the entire face as input to the fake detection system,
and ii) selecting specific facial regions such as the eyes or nose, among
others, as input to the fake detection system.
  Among all the findings resulting from our experiments, we highlight the poor
fake detection results achieved even by the strongest state-of-the-art fake
detectors in the latest DeepFake databases of the 2nd generation, with Equal
Error Rate results ranging from 15% to 30%. These results remark the necessity

the selection of the matching method to predict the result as well as to decide
whether to update the target template using the newly predicted result. The
existing methods, however, make these selections in a rough and inflexible way,

promise for advances in lasers, sensing, and non-reciprocal devices. And yet,
the microscopic origin of such effective, non-Hermitian models is not well
understood. Here, we show that a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian emerges naturally in
a double-quantum-dot-circuit-QED (DQD-circuit QED) set-up, which can be
controllably tuned to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric point. This effective
Hamiltonian, derived from a microscopic model for the set-up, governs the
dynamics of two coupled circuit-QED cavities with a voltage-biased DQD in one

observed both in the dynamics of cavity observables as well as via an

$\mathcal{PT}$-transition in this set-up, we show that loss-induced enhancement
of amplification and lasing can be observed in the coupled cavities. Our
results pave the way for an on-chip realization of a potentially scalable

  selection priors for Cox regression","  Important objectives in cancer research are the prediction of a patient's
risk based on molecular measurements such as gene expression data and the
identification of new prognostic biomarkers (e.g. genes). In clinical practice,
this is often challenging because patient cohorts are typically small and can
be heterogeneous. In classical subgroup analysis, a separate prediction model
is fitted using only the data of one specific cohort. However, this can lead to
a loss of power when the sample size is small. Simple pooling of all cohorts,
on the other hand, can lead to biased results, especially when the cohorts are
heterogeneous. For this situation, we propose a new Bayesian approach suitable
for continuous molecular measurements and survival outcome that identifies the
important predictors and provides a separate risk prediction model for each
cohort. It allows sharing information between cohorts to increase power by
assuming a graph linking predictors within and across different cohorts. The
graph helps to identify pathways of functionally related genes and genes that
are simultaneously prognostic in different cohorts. Results demonstrate that
our proposed approach is superior to the standard approaches in terms of
prediction performance and increased power in variable selection when the

Unlike generative modeling approaches that aim to $\it{model}$ the manifold
distribution, we directly $\it{represent}$ the given data manifold in the
classification space and leverage properties of latent space representations to
generate new representations that are guaranteed to be in the same class.
Interestingly, such representations allow for controlled sample generations for
any given class from existing samples and do not require enforcing prior
distribution. We show that these latent space representations can be smartly
manipulated (using convex combinations of $n$ samples, $n\geq2$) to yield
meaningful sample generations. Experiments on image datasets of varying
resolutions demonstrate that downstream generations have higher classification
accuracy than existing conditional generative models while being competitive in

developed a system that detects players from a unique cheap and wide-angle
fisheye camera assisted by a single narrow-angle thermal camera. In this work,
we train a network in a knowledge distillation approach in which the student
and the teacher have different modalities and a different view of the same

motion detection algorithm to handle the training in the region of the fisheye
camera not covered by the thermal one. We show that our solution is effective
in detecting players on the whole field filmed by the fisheye camera. We
evaluate it quantitatively and qualitatively in the case of an online

continuously adapted to the latest video conditions.

  Vector Beams","  High harmonic generation (HHG) is a manifestation of the strongly nonlinear
response of matter to intense laser fields and has, as the basis for coherent
XUV sources a variety of applications. Recently, HHG from atoms in a phase and
polarization structured laser was demonstrated and interpreted based on the
transverse electric field component of the driving pulse. Here we point out
that as dictated by Maxwell equations, such fields have a longitudinal
component which in general has a fundamental influence on the charge dynamics.
For instance, its interplay with the transversal field component enables
endowing the emitted radiation locally with circular polarization and a defined
polarity. It is shown that the time-dependent Stokes parameters defining the
polarization state of HHG can be tuned by varying the waist of the driving
field which in turn, changes the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse
electric-field components of the driving laser. In addition, employing a
multipole expansion of the produced harmonics exposes the specific multipolar
character and the relation to the spatial structure of the driving field
polarization states. The scheme proposed here allows a full polarization
control of the emitted harmonics by only one driving laser. A tighter focusing
of the driving pulse renders possible the emission of harmonics with both even
and odd spatial symmetry. The underlying mechanism is due to the fundamental
interplay between the transverse and longitudinal components of the laser's
electromagnetic vector potential. The ratio between those components is
controllable by just focusing the laser spot, pointing to an accessible tool
for polarization and polarity control of the high harmonics.

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can significantly reduce the required
critical current to inject the types of domain walls favored by the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We find that in chiral magnets it is only
possible to shed a single domain wall by means of spin-orbit torques, as they
modify the ground state orientation of the system. In contrast, for
spin-transfer-torque induced shedding of domain walls, we show that there exist
two different critical current densities for the two different domain wall
chiralities, respectively.
  Additionally, for the consecutive creation of domain walls by means of
spin-transfer torques, we find that the interaction between the domain walls
cannot be neglected and even may lead to the pairwise annihilation of
consecutive domain walls with opposite chiralities.

digital images. Namely, the simplicial Lefschetz number $L(f)$ and the cubical
Lefschetz number $\bar L(f)$. We show that $L(f)$ is a strong homotopy
invariant and has an approximate fixed point theorem. On the other hand, we
establish that $\bar L(f)$ is a homotopy invariant and has an $n$-approximate
fixed point result. In essence, this means that the fixed point result for
$L(f)$ is better than that for $\bar L(f)$ while the homotopy invariance of
$\bar L(f)$ is better than that of $L(f)$. Unlike in classical topology, these
Lefschetz numbers give lower bounds for the number of approximate fixed points.
Finally, we construct some illustrative examples to demonstrate our results.

CDM$ expansions repeating periodically, separated by some inflation and
radiation dominated phases. This so-called $\Lambda CDM$ periodic cosmology is
motivated by the possibility that inflation and the present phase of
accelerated expansion be due to the same dark energy. Then, in a phase space
showing the variation of matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ with respect to
this of the radiation $\Omega_r$, the curve $\Omega_m(\Omega_r)$ looks like a
closed trajectory that Universe could run through forever. In this case, the
end of the expansion acceleration of the $\Lambda CDM$ phase is the beginning
of a new inflation phase. We show that such a scenario implies the coupling of
matter and/or radiation to dark energy. We consider the simplest of these
$\Lambda CDM$ periodic models i.e. a vacuum energy coupled to radiation. From
matter domination phase to today, it behaves like a $\Lambda CDM$ model, then
followed by an inflation phase. But a sudden and fast decay of the dark energy
into radiation periodically ends the expansion acceleration. This leads to a
radiation dominated Universe preceding a new $\Lambda CDM$ type expansion. The
model is constrained with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations using
supernovae, Hubble expansion, BAO and CMB data and fits the data as well as the
$\Lambda CDM$ one.

  Approximate MDP and Reinforcement Learning Approach","  In this paper, we investigate the scheduling design of a mobile edge
computing (MEC) system, where active mobile devices with computation tasks
randomly appear in a cell. Every task can be computed at either the mobile
device or the MEC server. We jointly optimize the task offloading decision,
uplink transmission device selection and power allocation by formulating the
problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP). Compared with
most of the existing literature, this is the first attempt to address the
transmission and computation optimization with the random device arrivals in an
infinite time horizon to our best knowledge. Due to the uncertainty in the
device number and location, the conventional approximate MDP approaches
addressing the curse of dimensionality cannot be applied. An alternative and
suitable low-complexity solution framework is proposed in this work. We first
introduce a baseline scheduling policy, whose value function can be derived
analytically with the statistics of random mobile device arrivals. Then,
one-step policy iteration is adopted to obtain a sub-optimal scheduling policy
whose performance can be bounded analytically. The complexity of deriving the
sub-optimal policy is reduced dramatically compared with conventional solutions
of MDP by eliminating the complicated value iteration. To address a more
general scenario where the statistics of random mobile device arrivals are
unknown, a novel and efficient algorithm integrating reinforcement learning and
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is proposed to improve the system performance
in an online manner. Simulation results show that the gain of the sub-optimal
policy over various benchmarks is significant.

analysis to the case of multi-boundary correlators with the help of the
boundary creation operator. We clarify how the Korteweg-de Vries constraints
arise in the presence of multiple boundaries, deriving differential equations
obeyed by the correlators. The differential equations allow us to compute the
genus expansion of the correlators up to any order without ambiguity. We also
formulate a systematic method of calculating the WKB expansion of the
Baker-Akhiezer function and the 't Hooft expansion of the multi-boundary
correlators. This new formalism is much more efficient than our previous method
based on the topological recursion. We further investigate the low temperature
expansion of the two-boundary correlator. We formulate a method of computing it
up to any order and also find a universal form of the two-boundary correlator
in terms of the error function. Using this result we are able to write down the
analytic form of the spectral form factor in JT gravity and show how the ramp
and plateau behavior comes about. We also study the Hartle-Hawking state in the
free boson/fermion representation of the tau-function and discuss how it should
be related to the multi-boundary correlators.

that municipalities with a higher number of cases at the beginning of the

  neutrinos","  We discuss an experiment to investigate neutrino physics at the LHC in Run 3,
with emphasis on tau flavour. As described in our previous paper
[arXiv:1903.06564v1], the detector can be installed in the decommissioned TI18
tunnel, about 480 m downstream the ATLAS cavern, after the first bending
dipoles of the LHC arc. In that location, the prolongation of the beam
Line-of-Sight from Interaction Point IP1 to TI18 traverses about 100 m of rock.
The detector intercepts the intense neutrino flux, generated by the LHC beams
colliding in IP1, at large pseudorapidity eta, where neutrino energies can
exceed a TeV. This paper focuses on optimizing global features of the
experiment, like detector mass and acceptance. Since the neutrino-nucleon
interaction cross section grows almost linearly with energy, the detector can
be light and still collect a considerable sample of neutrino events; in the
present study it weighs less than 3 tons. The detector is positioned off the
beam axis, slightly above the ideal prolongation of the LHC beam from the
straight section, covering 7.4 < eta < 9.2. In this configuration, the flux at
high energies (0.5-1.5 TeV and beyond) is found to be dominated by neutrinos
originating directly from IP1, mostly from charm decays, of which about 50% are
electron neutrinos and about 5% are tau neutrinos. The contribution of pion and
kaon decays to the muon neutrino flux is studied by means of simulations that
embed the LHC optics and found small at high energies. The above studies
indicate that with 150 /fb of delivered LHC luminosity in Run 3 the experiment
can record a few thousand very high energy neutrino charged current
interactions and over 50 tau neutrino charged current events.

be placed inside a given container. The pieces must be placed so that they are
pairwise interior-disjoint, and only motions of the allowed type can be used to
move them there. We establish a framework which enables us to show that for
many combinations of allowed pieces, containers, and motions, the resulting

equivalent (under polynomial time reductions) to deciding whether a given
system of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer coefficients has a

as the motions, and problems where arbitrary rigid motions are allowed, i.e.,
both translations and rotations. When rotations are allowed, we show that the
following combinations of allowed pieces and containers are $\exists\mathbb

in GFD. Using the theory of controlled rough paths, we derive a class of rough
geophysical fluid dynamics (RGFD) models as critical points of rough action
functionals. These RGFD models characterize Lagrangian trajectories in fluid
dynamics as geometric rough paths (GRP) on the manifold of diffeomorphic maps.
Three constrained variational approaches are formulated for the derivation of
these models. The first is the Clebsch formulation, in which the constraints
are imposed as rough advection laws. The second is the Hamilton-Pontryagin
formulation, in which the constraints are imposed as right-invariant rough
vector fields. The third is the Euler--Poincar\'e formulation in which the
variations are constrained. These variational principles lead directly to the
Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian formulation of fluid dynamics on geometric rough
paths. The GRP framework preserves the geometric structure of fluid dynamics
obtained by using Lie group reduction to pass from Lagrangian to Eulerian
variational principles, thereby yielding a rough formulation of the Kelvin
circulation theorem. The rough-path variational approach includes non-Markovian
perturbations of the Lagrangian fluid trajectories. In particular, memory
effects can be introduced through this formulation through a judicious choice
of the rough path (e.g. a realization of a fractional Brownian motion). In the
special case when the rough path is a realization of a semimartingale, we
recover the SGFD models in Holm (2015). However, by eliminating the need for
stochastic variational tools, we retain a pathwise interpretation of the
Lagrangian trajectories. In contrast, the Lagrangian trajectories in the
stochastic framework are described by stochastic integrals which do not have a
pathwise interpretation. Thus, the rough path formulation restores this
property.

investigate the ergodicity recovery behavior, which helps to clarify the origin
and the convergence of trajectory-to-trajectory fluctuation in various
heterogeneous disordered media. The concepts of self-averaging and ergodicity
are revisited in the context of trajectory analysis. The slow ergodicity
recovery and the non-Gaussian diffusion in the annealed disordered media are
shown as the consequences of the central limit theorem in different situations.
The strange ergodicity recovery behavior is reported in the quenched disordered
case, which arises from a localization mechanism. The first-passage approach is
introduced to the ergodicity analysis for this case, of which the central limit
theorem can be employed and the ergodicity is recovered in the length scale of
diffusivity correlation.

MHD equilibrium calculation code, HINT, which is an initial value solver based
on the relaxation method without the assumption of nested flux surfaces. For
finite beta equilibria, flux surfaces become stochastic in the peripheral
region. However, though the axis shifts until the conventional limit, the
separatrix to limit the equilibrium does not appear. For high beta equilibria,
the force balance starts breaking in the stochastic region. To keep the force
balance, the pressure gradient in the stochastic region decreases and the fixed
profile is reduced. As the result, the volume averaged beta saturates. The beta
value, where the force balance starts breaking inside the stochastic region, is
proposed as an index of equilibrium beta limit in heliotron plasmas.

enables comparing two or more inequalities as themselves, with same or

is applicable to all Karamata's type inequalities, with integrals or sums. A

designed model to understand a high-level pattern. However, existing methods
rely heavily on supervised learning using large quantities of annotated image
samples, which are more costly to collect for important people detection than
for individual entity recognition (eg, object recognition). To overcome this
problem, we propose learning important people detection on partially annotated
images. Our approach iteratively learns to assign pseudo-labels to individuals
in un-annotated images and learns to update the important people detection
model based on data with both labels and pseudo-labels. To alleviate the
pseudo-labelling imbalance problem, we introduce a ranking strategy for
pseudo-label estimation, and also introduce two weighting strategies: one for
weighting the confidence that individuals are important people to strengthen
the learning on important people and the other for neglecting noisy unlabelled
images (ie, images without any important people). We have collected two
large-scale datasets for evaluation. The extensive experimental results clearly
confirm the efficacy of our method attained by leveraging unlabelled images for
improving the performance of important people detection.

in the high-temperature region where the itinerant Majorana fermions release
their entropy, both types of disorders suppress the longitudinal thermal
conductivity while keeping the specific heat almost unchanged. This suggests
that both disorders reduce the mean-free path of the Majorana fermions. On the
other hand, in the low-temperature region, the other specific heat peak
associated with the entropy release from the localized fluxes is suppressed for
both cases, but it is broadened and shifted to the lower-temperature side by
the bond randomness, while the position and the width are almost unchanged

Hall effect under a magnetic field; the half quantization of the thermal Hall
conductivity is fragile against the site dilution, while it remains for the
bond randomness despite the reduced onset temperature. We discuss the
contrasting behavior from the stability of the topological nature by
calculating flux condensation and Majorana excitation gap.

the utilization of location-specific information at the output layer, although
this spatial information can be beneficial for classification. In this paper,
we propose a novel spatial output layer on top of the existing convolutional
feature maps to explicitly exploit the location-specific output information. In
specific, given the spatial feature maps, we replace the previous GAP-FC layer
with a spatially attentive output layer (SAOL) by employing a attention mask on
spatial logits. The proposed location-specific attention selectively aggregates
spatial logits within a target region, which leads to not only the performance
improvement but also spatially interpretable outputs. Moreover, the proposed
SAOL also permits to fully exploit location-specific self-supervision as well
as self-distillation to enhance the generalization ability during training. The
proposed SAOL with self-supervision and self-distillation can be easily plugged
into existing CNNs. Experimental results on various classification tasks with
representative architectures show consistent performance improvements by SAOL
at almost the same computational cost.

computing $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths for $S \times V$, for a
subset $S \subseteq V$ of $|S| = n^r$ sources, for some $0 < r \le 1$. We
devise a significantly improved algorithm for this problem in the entire range
of parameter $r$, in both the classical centralized and in the parallel (PRAM)
models of computation. Specifically, our centralized algorithm for this problem
requires time $\tilde{O}(|E| \cdot n^{o(1)} + n^{\omega(r)})$, where
$n^{\omega(r)}$ is the time required to multiply an $n^r \times n$ matrix by an
$n \times n$ one. Our PRAM algorithm has polylogarithmic time $(\log
n)^{O(1/\rho)}$, and its work complexity is $\tilde{O}(|E| \cdot n^\rho +
n^{\omega(r)})$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\rho >0$.
  In particular, for $r \le 0.313\ldots$, our centralized algorithm computes $S
\times V$ $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths in $n^{2 + o(1)}$ time. Our
PRAM polylogarithmic-time algorithm has work complexity $O(|E| \cdot n^\rho +
n^{2+o(1)})$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\rho >0$. Previously existing
solutions either require centralized time/parallel work of $O(|E| \cdot |S|)$
or provide much weaker approximation guarantees.
  We also devise efficient algorithms for computing $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
shortest paths from each vertex to its $k$ nearest neighbors in {\em directed}
graphs. Here too the running time is only $O(n^{2+o(1)})$ even for polynomially
large $k\le n^{0.168}$.
  Our algorithm combines fast matrix multiplication with hopsets. Related ideas
were formerly used in the context of the Congested Clique model by
Censor-Hillel et al. \cite{CDKL19}. That model, however, suppresses heavy local
computations. We show that these computations can be replaced by fast matrix
multiplication.

for studying eukaryotic cell migration in DC electric fields. We have defined
the temporal electric persistence to characterize the memory that cells have in
a varying electric field. In addition to imposing a directional bias, we
observed that the electric field influences the cellular kinematics by
accelerating the movement of cells along their paths. Moreover, the study of
vegetative and briefly starved cells provided insight into the electrical
sensing of cells. We found evidence that conditioned medium of starved cells
was able to trigger the electrical sensing of vegetative cells that would
otherwise not orient themselves in the electric field. This observation may be
explained by the presence of the conditioned medium factor (CMF), a protein
secreted by the cells, when they begin to starve. The results of this study
give new insights into understanding the mechanism that triggers the electrical
sensing and transduces the external stimulus into directed cell migration.
Finally, the observed increased mobility of cells over time in an electric
field could offer a novel perspective towards wound healing assays.

Information Criterion the most commonly used technique. Typically, a number of
candidate models are defined a priori and ranked according to their expected
out-of-sample performance. Model selection, however, only assesses the relative
performance of the models and, as pointed out in a recent paper, a large
proportion of ecology papers that use model selection do not assess the
absolute fit of the `best' model. In this paper, it is argued that assessing
the absolute fit of the `best' model alone does not go far enough. This is
because a model that appears to perform well under model selection is also
likely to appear to perform well under measures of absolute fit, even when
there is no predictive value. A model selection permutation test is proposed
that assesses the probability that the model selection statistic of the `best'
model could have occurred by chance alone, whilst taking account of
dependencies between the models. It is argued that this test should always be
performed before formal model selection takes place. The test is demonstrated
on two real population modelling examples of ibex in northern Italy and wild
reindeer in Norway.

Control Barrier Function (CBF) and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF)-based

coding, has been attested for its success in countless projects around the
world. Hence, applying the Git philosophy to general data collaboration beyond
coding is motivating. We call it Git for data. However, the original Git design
handles data at the file granule, which is considered too coarse-grained for
many database applications. We argue that Git for data should be co-designed
with database systems. To this end, we developed ForkBase to make Git for data
practical. ForkBase is a distributed, immutable storage system designed for
data version management and data collaborative operation. In this
demonstration, we show how ForkBase can greatly facilitate collaborative data
management and how its novel data deduplication technique can improve storage
efficiency for archiving massive data versions.

(HI) clouds using the latest CO data obtained from the four-beam receiver
system on a 45-m telescope (FOREST) unbiased Galactic plane imaging survey with
the Nobeyama 45-m telescope (FUGIN) and HI data taken from the Very Large Array
(VLA) Galactic plane survey (VGPS). We applied a dendrogram algorithm to the HI
data cube to identify HI clouds, and we calculated the HI mass and molecular
gas mass by summing the CO line intensity within each HI cloud. On the basis of
the results, we created a catalog of 5,737 identified HI clouds with local
standard of rest (LSR) velocity of $V_{\rm LSR}\le -20$ km s$^{-1}$ in Galactic
longitude and latitude ranges of $20^\circ \le l \le 50^\circ$ and $-1^\circ
\le b \le 1^\circ$, respectively. We found that most of the HI clouds are
distributed within a Galactocentric distance of 16 kpc, most of which are in
the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) phase. In addition, we determined that the
high-mass end of the mass HI function is well fitted with the power-law
function with an index of 2.3. Although two sequences of self-gravitating and
diffuse clouds are expected to appear in the M$_{\rm tot}$-M$_{{\rm H}_2}$
diagram according to previous works based on a plane-parallel model, the
observational data show only a single sequence with large scattering within
these two sequences. This implies that most of the clouds are mixtures of these
two types of clouds. Moreover, we suggest the following scenario of molecular
gas formation: An HI-dominant cloud evolved with increasing H$_2$ mass along a
path of $M_{{\rm H}_2} \propto M_{\rm tot}^2$ by collecting diffuse gas before
reaching and moving along the curves of the two sequences.

the quiet solar chromosphere at 3 mm. Our dataset included images of six 87'' x
87'' regions of the quiet Sun obtained with angular resolution of a few arcsec
at a cadence of 2 s. The transient brightenings were detected as weak
enhancements above the average intensity after we removed the effect of the
p-mode oscillations. A similar analysis, over the same regions, was performed
for simultaneous 304 and 1600 \AA\ data obtained with the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly. We detected 184 3 mm transient brightening events with brightness
temperatures from 70 K to more than 500 K above backgrounds of $\sim 7200-7450$
K. Their mean duration and maximum area were 51.1 s and 12.3 Mm$^2$,
respectively, with a weak preference of appearing at network boundaries rather
than in cell interiors. Both parameters exhibited power-law behavior with
indices of 2.35 and 2.71, respectively. Only a small fraction of ALMA events
had either 304 or 1600 \AA\ counterparts but the properties of these events
were not significantly different from those of the general population except
that they lacked their low-end energy values. The total thermal energies of the
ALMA transient brightenings were between $1.5 \times 10^{24}$ and $9.9 \times
10^{25}$ erg and their frequency distribution versus energy was a power law
with an index of 1.67. We found that the power per unit area provided by the
ALMA events could account for only 1\% of the chromospheric radiative losses
(10\% of the coronal ones). Therefore, their energy budget falls short of
meeting the requirements for the heating of the upper layers of the solar
atmosphere and this conclusion does not change even if we use the least
restrictive criteria possible for the detection of transient brightenings.

intentional stance. In a series of three experiments, we identify two factors
that could potentially influence mind perception and moral concern in robots:
how the robot is introduced (framing), and how the robot acts (social
behaviour). In the first two online experiments, we show that both framing and
behaviour independently influence participants' mind perception. However, when
we combined both variables in the following real-world experiment, these
effects failed to replicate. We hence identify a third factor post-hoc: the
online versus real-world nature of the interactions. After analysing potential
confounds, we tentatively suggest that mind perception is harder to influence
in real-world experiments, as manipulations are harder to isolate compared to
virtual experiments, which only provide a slice of the interaction.

behaviours in dihadron $\Delta\eta$--$\Delta\varphi$ correlations recently
reported by the LHC in high-multiplicity proton-proton (pp) collisions. The
kick stand model is based on a momentum kick by leading jets to partons in the
medium close to the leading jets. The medium where partons move freely is
assumed in the model regardless of collision systems. This helps us apply the
method to small systems like pp collisions in a simple way. Also, the momentum
transfer is purely kinematic and this provides us a strong way to approach the
ridge behaviour analytically. There are already several results with this
approach in high-energy heavy-ion collisions from the STAR and PHENIX at RHIC
and from the CMS at LHC. The momentum-kick model is extended to the recent
ridge results in high-multiplicity pp collisions with the ATLAS and CMS at LHC.
The medium property in high-multiplicity pp collisions is diagnosed with the
result of the model.

of proteins (e.g. alpha-helix vs hybrids of alpha-helices and beta-sheets), but
it is also capable of determining different folding states of the same protein,
or the binding events of proteins to ligands. Using the DeepDream algorithm,
instances of key features of the deep neural network can be made visible in a
range of images, allowing us to explore the inner workings of protein surface
wave patter neural networks, as well as the creation of new images by finding
and highlighting features of protein molecular spectra in a range of
photographic input. The integration of the water-focused realization of
cymatics, combined with neural networks and especially generative methods,
offer a new direction to realize materiomusical ""Inceptionism"" as a possible

detecting different protein structures, the effect of mutations, or uses in
medical imaging and diagnostics, with broad impact in nano-to-macro
transitions.

The 2-10 keV flux limit of the sample is 2e-15 erg/s/cm2. The sources are
distributed over a redshift range of z=0.1-3.8. Eleven new X-ray redshift
measurements are included. A spectral analysis was performed using a simple
model to obtain absorbing column densities, rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosities
and Fe K line properties of 180 sources at z>0.4. Obscured AGN are found to be
more abundant toward higher redshifts. Using the XMM-Newton data alone, seven
Compton-thick AGN candidates are identified, which makes the Compton-thick AGN
fraction to be ~4%. An exploratory spectral inspection method with two
rest-frame X-ray colours and an Fe line strength indicator is introduced and
tested against the results from spectral fitting. This method works reasonably
well to characterise a spectral shape and can be useful for a pre-selection of
Compton-thick AGN candidates. We found six objects exhibiting broad Fe K lines
out of 21 unobscured AGN of best data quality, implying a detection rate of
~30%. Five redshift spikes, each of which has more than six sources, are
identified in the redshift distribution of the X-ray sources. Contrary to the
overall trend, the sources at the two higher-redshift spikes at z=1.61 and
z=2.57 have puzzlingly low obscuration.

  System based on Public Blockchain","  Securing the traceability of products in the supply chain is an urgent issue.
Recently, supply chain systems that use public blockchain (PBC) have been
proposed. In these systems, PBC is used as a common database shared between
supply chain parties to secure the integrity and reliability of distribution
information such as ownership transfer records. Thus, these systems secure a
high level of traceability in the supply chain. However, the distribution
information, which can be private information, is made public since the
information recorded in PBC can be read by anyone. In this paper, we propose a
method for preserving privacy while securing traceability in a supply chain
system using PBC. The proposed method preserves privacy by concealing the
distribution information via encryption. In addition, the proposed method
ensures distribution among legitimate supply chain parties while concealing
their blockchain address by using a zero-knowledge proof to prove their
authenticity. We implement the proposed method on Ethereum smart contracts and
evaluate cost performance based on transaction fees. The results show that the
fee per party is at most 2.6 USD.

perform a comparative analysis of information transfer between industry sectors
of the Chinese and the USA stock markets, using daily sector indices for the
period from 2000 to 2017. The information flow from one sector to another is
measured by the transfer entropy of the daily returns of the two sector
indices. We find that the most active sector in information exchange (i.e., the
largest total information inflow and outflow) is the {\textit{non-bank
financial}} sector in the Chinese market and the {\textit{technology}} sector
in the USA market. This is consistent with the role of the non-bank sector in
corporate financing in China and the impact of technological innovation in the
USA. In each market, the most active sector is also the largest information
sink that has the largest information inflow (i.e., inflow minus outflow). In
contrast, we identify that the main information source is the {\textit{bank}}
sector in the Chinese market and the {\textit{energy}} sector in the USA
market. In the case of China, this is due to the importance of net bank lending
as a signal of corporate activity and the role of energy pricing in affecting
corporate profitability. There are sectors such as the {\textit{real estate}}
sector that could be an information sink in one market but an information
source in the other, showing the complex behavior of different markets.
Overall, these findings show that stock markets are more synchronized, or
ordered, during periods of turmoil than during periods of stability.

the field of electric power system simulations. While Newton-based methods have
been used to advantage, they sometimes do not converge, leaving the user
wondering whether a solution exists. In addition to improved robustness, one
advantage of holomorphic embedding methods (HEM) is that, even when they do not
converge, roots plots of the Pad\'e approximants (PAs) to the functions in the
inverse-$\alpha$ plane can be used to determine whether a solution exist. The
convergence factor (CF) of the near-diagonal PAs applied to functions expanded
about the origin is determined by the logarithmic capacity of the associated
branch cut (BC) and the distance of the evaluation point from the origin.
However the underlying mechanism governing this rate has been obscure. We prove
that the ultimate distribution of the PA roots on the BC in the complex plane
converges weakly to the equilibrium distribution of electrostatic charges on a
2-D conductor system with the same topology in a physical setting. This, along
with properties of the Maclaurin series can be used to explain the structure of

values. In fact, due to the limitation of the receptive field, the 3 x 3 kernel
has difficulty in covering the corresponding features at high/original
resolution. Multi-resolution and multi-convolution techniques can improve but
fail to avoid this problem. In this study, we constructed pyramidal feature
sets on moving and fixed images and used the warped moving and fixed features
to estimate their ""residual"" deformation field at each scale, called the
Pyramidal Residual Deformation Field Estimation module (PRDFE-Module). The
""total"" deformation field at each scale was computed by upsampling and weighted
summing all the ""residual"" deformation fields at all its previous scales, which
can effectively and accurately transfer the deformation fields from low
resolution to high resolution and is used for warping the moving features at
each scale. Simulation and real brain data results show that our method
improves the accuracy of the registration and the rationality of the
deformation field.

intervene in multi-agent systems in order to impact group-wide metrics of
success. This is particularly challenging when proposed interventions are novel
and expensive. For example, one may wish to modify a building's layout to
improve the efficiency of its escape route. Evaluating such interventions would
generally require access to an elaborate simulator, which must be constructed
ad-hoc for each environment, and can be prohibitively costly or inaccurate.
Here we examine a simple alternative: Optimize By Observational Extrapolation

interventions, to learn predictive models mapping environment states to
individual agent outcomes, and then use these to evaluate and select changes.
We evaluate OBOE in socially complex gridworld environments and consider novel
physical interventions that our models were not trained on. We show that neural
network models trained to predict agent returns on baseline environments are
effective at selecting among the interventions. Thus, OBOE can provide guidance
for challenging questions like: ""which wall should I tear down in order to

of this prebiotic species outside a star-forming region. Urea remains
undetected toward the proto-Sun IRAS16293-2422 B (upper limit to its abundance

research and despite the enormous interest in the non-Markovian dynamics of
single molecules and solutes, the onset of friction from the atomistic scale so
far could not be demonstrated. Here, we fill this gap based on
frequency-resolved friction data from high-precision simulations of three
prototypical liquids, including water. Combining with rigorous theoretical
arguments, we show that friction in liquids emerges abruptly at a
characteristic frequency, beyond which viscous liquids appear as
non-dissipative, elastic solids; as a consequence, its origin is non-local in
time. Concomitantly, the molecules experience Brownian forces that display
persistent correlations and long-lasting memory. A critical test of the
generalised Stokes-Einstein relation, mapping the friction of single molecules
to the viscoelastic response of the macroscopic sample, disproves the relation
for Newtonian fluids, but substantiates it exemplarily for water and a
moderately supercooled liquid. The employed approach is suitable to yield novel
insights into vitrification mechanisms and the intriguing mechanical properties
of soft materials.

  Quantum Impurity Solver","  The accurate characterization of nonequilibrium strongly-correlated quantum
systems has been a longstanding challenge in many-body physics. Notable among
them are quantum impurity models, which appear in various nanoelectronic and
quantum computing applications. Despite their seeming simplicity, they feature
correlated phenomena, including emergent energy scales and non-Fermi-liquid
physics, requiring renormalization group treatment. This has typically been at
odds with the description of their nonequilibrium steady-state under finite
bias, which exposes their nature as open quantum systems. We present a novel
numerically-exact method for obtaining the nonequilibrium state of a general
quantum impurity coupled to metallic leads at arbitrary voltage or temperature
bias, which we call ""RL-NESS"" (Renormalized Lindblad-driven NonEquilibrium
Steady-State). It is based on coherently coupling the impurity to discretized
leads which are treated exactly. These leads are furthermore weakly coupled to
reservoirs described by Lindblad dynamics which impose voltage or temperature
bias. Going beyond previous attempts, we exploit a hybrid discretization scheme
for the leads together with Wilson's numerical renormalization group, in order
to probe exponentially small energy scales. The steady-state is then found by
evolving a matrix-product density operator via real-time Lindblad dynamics,
employing a dissipative generalization of the time-dependent density matrix
renormalization group. In the long-time limit, this procedure converges to the
steady-state at finite bond dimension due to the introduced dissipation, which
bounds the growth of entanglement. We test the method against the exact
solution of the noninteracting resonant level model. We demonstrate its power
using an interacting two-level model, for which it correctly reproduces the
known limits, and gives the full $I$-$V$ curve between them.

approaches for the detection of lane markings proved sufficient. More recently,
however data-driven approaches have been proposed that show superior results.
These deep learning approaches typically propose a classification of the
free-space using for example semantic segmentation. While these examples focus
and optimize on unmarked inner-city roads, we believe that mapless driving in
complex highway scenarios is still not handled with sufficient robustness and
availability. Especially in challenging weather situations such as heavy rain,
fog at night or reflections in puddles, the reliable detection of lane markings
will decrease significantly or completely fail with low-cost video-only AD
systems. Therefore, we propose to specifically classify a drivable corridor in
the ego-lane on a pixel level with a deep learning approach. Our approach is
intentionally kept simple with only 660k parameters. Thus, we were able to
easily integrate our algorithm into an online AD system of a test vehicle. We
demonstrate the performance of our approach under challenging conditions
qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison to a state-of-the-art
model-driven approach. We see the current approach as a fallback method
whenever a model-driven approach cannot cope with a specific scenario. Due to
this, a fallback method does not have to fulfill the same requirements on
comfort in lateral control as the primary algorithm: Its task is to catch the
temporal shortcomings of the main perception task.

proof-of-concept study focused on instance-level selection in the framework of
delexicalized parser transfer. We start from an empirical observation that
different source parsers are the best choice for different Universal POS
sequences in the target language. We then propose to predict the best parser at
the instance level. To this end, we train a supervised regression model, based
on the Transformer architecture, to predict parser accuracies for individual
POS-sequences. We compare ILPS against two strong single-best parser selection
baselines (SBPS): (1) a model that compares POS n-gram distributions between
the source and target languages (KL) and (2) a model that selects the source
based on the similarity between manually created language vectors encoding
syntactic properties of languages (L2V). The results from our extensive
evaluation, coupling 42 source parsers and 20 diverse low-resource test
languages, show that ILPS outperforms KL and L2V on 13/20 and 14/20 test
languages, respectively. Further, we show that by predicting the best parser
""at the treebank level"" (SBPS), using the aggregation of predictions from our
instance-level model, we outperform the same baselines on 17/20 and 16/20 test
languages.

and the principle of machine learning. By taking advantage of the independence
feature of each mode, we use the principle of unsupervised learning, making the
training process of the deep neural network becomes the process of modal
separation. A self-coding deep neural network is designed to identify the
structural modal parameters from the vibration data of structures. The mixture
signals, that is, the structural response data, are used as the input of the
neural network. Then we use a complex cost function to restrict the training
process of the neural network, making the output of the third layer the modal
responses we want, and the weights of the last two layers are mode shapes. The
deep neural network is essentially a nonlinear objective function optimization
problem. A novel loss function is proposed to constrain the independent feature
with consideration of uncorrelation and non-Gaussianity to restrict the
designed neural network to obtain the structural modal parameters. A numerical
example of a simple structure and an example of actual SHM data from a
cable-stayed bridge are presented to illustrate the modal parameter
identification ability of the proposed approach. The results show the approach

CoRoT and Kepler, the scientific community could detect and characterize the
power spectra of hundreds of thousands of stars. Using the scaling relations,
it is possible to estimate masses and radii for solar-type pulsators. However,
these stars are not the only kind of stellar objects that follow these rules:
$\delta$ Scuti stars seem to be characterized with seismic indexes such as the
large separation ($\Delta\nu$). Thanks to long-duration high-cadence TESS light
curves, we analysed more than two thousand of this kind of classical pulsators.
In that way, we propose the frequency at maximum power ($\nu_{\rm max}$) as a
proper seismic index since it is directly related with the intrinsic
temperature, mass and radius of the star. This parameter seems not to be
affected by rotation, inclination, extinction or resonances, with the exception
of the evolution of the stellar parameters. Furthermore, we can constrain
rotation and inclination using the departure of temperature produced by the
gravity-darkening effect. This is especially feasible for fast rotators as most
of $\delta$ Scuti stars seem to be.

has proven to be very efficient and accurate for interpolating and
extrapolating eigenvectors. However, almost nothing is known about how the
method converges, and its rapid convergence properties have remained
mysterious. In this letter we present the first study of the convergence of
eigenvector continuation. In order to perform the mathematical analysis, we
introduce a new variant of eigenvector continuation that we call vector
continuation. We first prove that eigenvector continuation and vector
continuation have identical convergence properties and then analyze the
convergence of vector continuation. Our analysis shows that, in general,
eigenvector continuation converges more rapidly than perturbation theory. The
faster convergence is achieved by eliminating a phenomenon that we call
differential folding, the interference between non-orthogonal vectors appearing
at different orders in perturbation theory. From our analysis we can predict
how eigenvector continuation converges both inside and outside the radius of
convergence of perturbation theory. While eigenvector continuation is a
non-perturbative method, we show that its rate of convergence can be deduced
from power series expansions of the eigenvectors. Our results also yield new
insights into the nature of divergences in perturbation theory.

leverage the current RF spectrum crisis in indoor scenarios. One of the main
problems in VLC is the limited dynamic range of LEDs and their nonlinear
response, which may lead to a severe degradation in the communication, and more
specifically in the bit error rate (BER). This is aggravated by the extensive
usage of multicarrier multiplexing, based on optical orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (O-OFDM), characterized by a high peak-to-average power
ratio. Here, we present a chaos-based coded modulation (CCM) setup specifically
adapted to the LED nonlinearities. It replaces the usual modulation, while
keeping the multicarrier O-OFDM structure unchanged. First, we obtain a
semi-analytical bound for the bit error probability, taking into account the
LED nonlinear response. The bound results particularly tight for the range of
signal-to-noise ratio of interest. Then, we propose a method to design the
modulator based on optimization techniques. The objective function is the
semi-analytical bound, and the optimization is applied to a parameterization of
the CCM conjugation function. This appropriately shapes the chaotic waveform
and leads to BER improvements that outperform classical counterparts under
ideal predistortion.

are clearly distinguished in coronagraph observations, but they don't have a
clear source signature. A particular type of stealth CMEs occurs in the
trailing current sheet of a previous ejection, therefore, we used the 2.5D MHD
package of the code MPI-AMRVAC to numerically simulate consecutive CMEs by
imposing shearing motions onto the inner boundary. The initial magnetic
configuration consists of a triple arcade structure embedded into a bimodal
solar wind, and the sheared polarity inversion line is found in the southern
loop system. The mesh was continuously adapted through a refinement method that
applies to current carrying structures. We then compared the obtained eruptions
with the observed directions of propagation of an initial multiple coronal mass
ejection (MCME) event that occurred in September 2009. We further analysed the
simulated ejections by tracking the centre of their flux ropes in latitude and
their total speed. Radial Poynting flux computation was employed as well to
follow the evolution of electromagnetic energy introduced into the system.
  Results: Changes within 1\% in the shearing speed result in three different
scenarios for the second CME, although the preceding eruption seems
insusceptible to such small variations. Depending on the applied shearing
speed, we thus obtain a failed eruption, a stealth, or a CME driven by the
imposed shear, as the second ejection. The dynamics of all eruptions are
compared with the observed directions of propagation of an MCME event and a
good correlation is achieved. The Poynting flux analysis reveals the temporal
variation of the important steps of eruptions. For the first time, a stealth
CME is simulated in the aftermath of a first eruption, through changes in the
applied shearing speed.

vector perturbations. Considering perfect fluids or scalar fields, vector
perturbations evolve kinematically as $a^{-2}$, where $a$ is the scale factor.
Consequently, a definite answer concerning the bounce stability depends on an
arbitrary constant, therefore, there is no definitive answer. In this paper, we
consider a more general situation where the primeval material medium is a
non-ideal fluid, and its shear viscosity is capable of producing torque
oscillations, which can create and dynamically sustain vector perturbations
along cosmic evolution. In this framework, one can set that vector
perturbations have a quantum mechanical origin, coming from quantum vacuum
fluctuations in the far past of the bouncing model, as it is done with scalar
and tensor perturbations. Under this prescription, one can calculate their
evolution during the whole history of the bouncing model, and precisely infer
the conditions under which they remain linear before the expanding phase. It is
shown that such linearity conditions impose constraints on the free parameters
of bouncing models, which are mild, although not trivial, allowing a large
class of possibilities. Such conditions impose that vector perturbations are
also not observationally relevant in the expanding phase. The conclusion is
that bouncing models are generally stable under vector perturbations. As they
are also stable under scalar and tensor perturbations, we conclude that
bouncing models are generally stable under perturbations originated from
quantum vacuum perturbations in the far past of their contracting phase.

a cumbersome task. Another possible approach is to use both generator and

adversarial training, this model is often unstable in a way that the
performance fluctuates drastically with each training step. In this study, we
propose a framework that effectively generates stable results across a wide

examples are obtained by utilizing an old state of the same generator. This
way, the discriminator learns to detect subtle distortions that often appear in
reconstructions of the anomaly inputs. Extensive experiments performed on
Caltech-256 and MNIST image datasets for novelty detection show superior
results. Furthermore, on UCSD Ped2 video dataset for anomaly detection, our

rigorously shown) that the physics of diffraction imposes certain fundamental
limits on the resolution of an optical system. However our understanding of
what exactly can and cannot be resolved has never risen above heuristic
arguments which, even worse, appear contradictory. In this work we remedy this
gap by studying the diffraction limit as a statistical inverse problem and,
based on connections to provable algorithms for learning mixture models, we
rigorously prove upper and lower bounds on how many photons we need (and how
precisely we need to record their locations) to resolve closely-spaced point
sources.
  We give the first provable algorithms that work regardless of the separation,
but only for a constant number of point sources. Surprisingly, we show that
when the number of point sources becomes large, there is a phase transition
where the sample complexity goes from polynomial to exponential, and we pin
down its location to within a universal constant that is independent of the
number of point sources. Thus it is rigorously possible both to break the
diffraction limit and yet to prove strong impossibility results depending on
the setup. This is the first non-asymptotic statistical foundation for
resolution in a model arising from first principles in physics, and helps
clarify many omnipresent debates in the optics literature.

  and sub-micron sized 2-D droplets","  Heat transfer via phase change is a major contributor to heat removal in
numerous engineering applications. Thin films of liquid result in increased
heat transfer due to a reduction of conduction resistance, in addition the
pressure jump at the liquid-vapor interface also affects the rate and direction
of rate of phase change. Because of these effects the morphology of the
substrate surface is expected to affect the film shape, hence heat transfer,
especially in thin films. In this study, the influence of surface
characteristics on the rate of phase change from micron and sub-micron sized
2-D droplets-i.e. films extending to infinity-forming on a substrate are
modeled. Surface film profiles are generated on both flat and non-flat
surfaces, triangular or wavy in nature, and a kinetic model for
quasi-equilibrium phase change is applied. Due to the presence of
intermolecular forces at the contact line, which render the solution of the
augmented Young-Laplace equation stiff, an implicit scheme is employed for the
numerical integration. To verify the method, the predictions of a molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation of a nano sized droplet present on a V-grooved surface
is compared to the continuum model. The augmented Young-Laplace equation is
solved numerically along with a phase change model originating from kinetic
theory to calculate the shape of the two-phase interface forming the droplet
and study the effect of various parameters on the rate of phase change. Results
are obtained for droplets with liquid pressures higher and lower than that of
vapor, resulting in opposite contribution to phase change due to the pressure
jump at the interface. The results show that the heat transfer rate can be
substantially altered due primarily to the combined effects of surface
morphology and disjoining pressure.

  Watching Behavior","  People nowadays are increasingly dependent on mobile phones for daily
communication, study, and business. Along with this it incurs the low-battery
anxiety (LBA). Although having been unveiled for a while, LBA has not been
thoroughly investigated yet. Without a better understanding of LBA, it would be
difficult to precisely validate energy saving and management techniques in
terms of alleviating LBA and enhancing Quality of Experience (QoE) of mobile
users. To fill the gap, we conduct an investigation over 2000+ mobile users,
look into their feelings and reactions towards LBA, and quantify their anxiety
degree during the draining of battery power. As a case study, we also
investigate the impact of LBA on user's behavior at video watching, and with
the massive collected answers we are able to quantify user's abandoning
likelihood of attractive videos versus the battery status of mobile phone. The
empirical findings and quantitative models obtained in this work not only
disclose the characteristics of LBA among modern mobile users, but also provide
valuable references for the design, evaluation, and improvement of QoE-aware
mobile applications and services.

the editor. NLP2TestableCode also includes functionality to automatically
generate customisable test cases and suggest argument and return types, in

SU(2) doublet with charged lepton. The lepton family number is defined through
a weak basis of SU(2) doublet in which the charged lepton mass matrix is a real

with a left-handed current of the neutrino family. We study the time evolution
of the lepton family number operator for Majorana neutrino. To be definite, we
introduce the mass term at $t=0$ and study the time evolution of the lepton
family number for the later time. Since the operator in flavor eigenstate is
continuously connected to that of the mass eigenstate, the creation and
annihilation operators for flavor eigenstates are related to those of mass
eigenstates. The total lepton number of the Majorana neutrino is conserved. By
choosing a specific flavor eigenstate of neutrino as an initial state, we
compute the time evolution of all lepton family numbers. They are sensitive to
Majorana and Dirac phases and also are sensitive to the absolute mass and mass
hierarchy of neutrinos.

Heisenberg exchange interaction between two electrons in contact with each
other. This interaction is controllable by electrically tailoring the overlap
between electronic wavefunctions in quantum dot systems, as long as they occupy
neighbouring dots. An alternative route is the exploration of superexchange -
the coupling between remote spins mediated by a third idle electron that
bridges the distance between quantum dots. We experimentally demonstrate direct
exchange coupling and provide evidence for second neighbour mediated
superexchange in a linear array of three single-electron spin qubits in
silicon, inferred from the electron spin resonance frequency spectra. We
confirm theoretically through atomistic modeling that the device geometry only
allows for sizeable direct exchange coupling for neighbouring dots, while next
nearest neighbour coupling cannot stem from the vanishingly small tail of the
electronic wavefunction of the remote dots, and is only possible if mediated.

  pulsar with 10-year Fermi LAT data","  Context: The Crab pulsar is a bright $\gamma$-ray source detected at photon
energies up to $\sim$1 TeV. Its phase-averaged and phase-resolved $\gamma$-ray
spectra both exhibit (sub-)exponential cutoffs while those above 10 GeV
apparently follow simple power-laws. Aims: We re-visit the $\gamma$-ray
properties of the Crab pulsar with 10-year \emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope
(LAT) data in the range of 60 MeV--500 GeV. With the phase-resolved spectra, we
investigate the origins and mechanisms responsible for the emissions. Methods:
The phaseograms are reconstructed for different energy bands and further
analysed using a wavelet decomposition. The phase-resolved energy spectra are
combined with the observations of ground-based instruments like MAGIC and
VERITAS to achieve a larger energy converage. We fit power-law models to the
overlapping energy spectra from 10 GeV to $\sim$1 TeV. We include in the fit a
relative cross-calibration of energy scales between air-shower based gamma-ray
telescopes with the orbital pair-production telescope of the Fermi mission.
Results: We confirm the energy-dependence of the $\gamma$-ray pulse shape, and
equivalently, the phase-dependence of the spectral shape for the Crab pulsar. A
relatively sharp exponential cutoff at a relatively high energy of $\sim$8 GeV
is observed for the bridge-phase emission. The $E>$10 GeV spectrum observed for
the second pulse peak is harder than those for other phases. Conclusions: In
view of the diversity of phase-resolved spectral shapes of the Crab pulsar, we
tentatively propose a multi-origin scenario where the polar-cap, outer-gap and
relativistic-wind regions are involved.

spatially flat universe, using large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations
that form part of the BAHAMAS project. As DDE changes the expansion history of
the universe, it impacts the growth of structure. We explore variations in DDE
that are constrained to be consistent with the cosmic microwave background. We
find that DDE can affect the clustering of matter and haloes at the ~10% level
(suppressing it for so-called `freezing' models, while enhancing it for
`thawing' models), which should be distinguishable with upcoming large-scale
structure surveys. DDE cosmologies can also enhance or suppress the halo mass
function (with respect to LCDM) over a wide range of halo masses. The internal
properties of haloes are minimally affected by changes in DDE, however.
Finally, we show that the impact of baryons and associated feedback processes
is largely independent of the change in cosmology and that these processes can
be modelled separately to typically better than a few percent accuracy

one in this regard. Here, we make significant progress in answering this
question, by showing that every tight Bell inequality is violated by 'Almost

multi-outcome non-local computation games, that do not admit quantum

use of the intriguing connections between Bell correlations and the

have been successfully developed and made available to the masses (i.e.,
FaceSwap, deepfake, etc.). These methods enable anyone to easily edit faces in
video sequences with incredibly realistic results and a very little effort.
Despite the usefulness of these tools in many fields, if used maliciously, they
can have a significantly bad impact on society (e.g., fake news spreading,
cyber bullying through fake revenge porn). The ability of objectively detecting
whether a face has been manipulated in a video sequence is then a task of
utmost importance. In this paper, we tackle the problem of face manipulation
detection in video sequences targeting modern facial manipulation techniques.
In particular, we study the ensembling of different trained Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) models. In the proposed solution, different models are
obtained starting from a base network (i.e., EfficientNetB4) making use of two
different concepts: (i) attention layers; (ii) siamese training. We show that
combining these networks leads to promising face manipulation detection results

inserting edges between the edges of an underlying tree. Orchard networks are a
recently introduced generalization of the class of tree-child networks.
Structural characterizations have already been discovered for tree-based
networks; this is not the case for orchard networks. In this paper, we
introduce cherry covers---a unifying characterization of both network
classes---in which we decompose the edges of the networks into so-called cherry

characterize the class of tree-based networks as well as the class of orchard
networks. Moreover, we also generalize these results to non-binary networks.

with more functionalities. One of the most attracting ones is streaming. Users
may broadcast part of their daily lives to thousands of others world-wide and
interact with them in real-time. Unfortunately, this feature is reportedly
exploited for grooming. In this work, we provide the first in-depth analysis of
this problem for social live streaming services. More precisely, using a
dataset that we collected, we identify predatory behaviours and grooming on
chats that bypassed the moderation mechanisms of the LiveMe, the service under
investigation. Beyond the traditional text approaches, we also investigate the
relevance of emojis in this context, as well as the user interactions through
the gift mechanisms of LiveMe. Finally, our analysis indicates the possibility

  Learning","  Mitigating the substantial undesirable impact of transportation systems on
the environment is paramount. Thus, predicting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions
is one of the profound topics, especially with the emergence of intelligent
transportation systems (ITS). We develop a deep learning framework to predict
link-level GHG emission rate (ER) (in CO2eq gram/second) based on the most
representative predictors, such as speed, density, and the GHG ER of previous
time steps. In particular, various specifications of the long-short term memory
(LSTM) networks with exogenous variables are examined and compared with
clustering and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with
exogenous variables. The downtown Toronto road network is used as the case
study and highly detailed data are synthesized using a calibrated traffic
microsimulation and MOVES. It is found that LSTM specification with speed,
density, GHG ER, and in-links speed from three previous minutes performs the
best while adopting 2 hidden layers and when the hyper-parameters are
systematically tuned. Adopting a 30 second updating interval improves slightly
the correlation between true and predicted GHG ERs, but contributes negatively
to the prediction accuracy as reflected on the increased root mean square error
(RMSE) value. Efficiently predicting GHG emissions at a higher frequency with
lower data requirements will pave the way to non-myopic eco-routing on
large-scale road networks {to alleviate the adverse impact on the global

As a consequence, online social deception (OSD) in SNSs has emerged as a
serious threat in cyberspace, particularly for users vulnerable to such
cyberattacks. Cyber attackers have exploited the sophisticated features of SNSs
to carry out harmful OSD activities, such as financial fraud, privacy threat,
or sexual/labor exploitation. Therefore, it is critical to understand OSD and
develop effective countermeasures against OSD for building a trustworthy SNSs.
In this paper, we conducted an extensive survey, covering (i) the
multidisciplinary concepts of social deception; (ii) types of OSD attacks and
their unique characteristics compared to other social network attacks and
cybercrimes; (iii) comprehensive defense mechanisms embracing prevention,
detection, and response (or mitigation) against OSD attacks along with their

test consists only in local quantum operations and authenticated classical
communication once a state is shared among them and provides composable
security, namely it can be used as a secure subroutine by $n$ honest parties
within larger communication protocols to test if a source is sharing quantum
states that are at least $\epsilon$-close to the GHZ state. This claim comes on
top of previous results on multipartite entanglement verification where the
security was studied in the usual game-based model. Here we improve the
protocol to make it more suitable for practical use in a quantum network and we
study its security in the Abstract Cryptography framework to highlight
composability issues and avoid hidden assumptions. This framework is a
top-to-bottom theory that makes explicit any piece of information that each
component (party or resource) gets at every time-step of the protocol. Moreover
any security proof, which amounts to showing indistinguishability between an
ideal resource having the desired security properties (up to local simulation)
and the concrete resource representing the protocol, is composable for free in
this setting. Our protocol can typically be used as a subroutine in a Quantum
Internet, to securely share a GHZ state among the network before performing a

is therefore important to regulate the widespread distribution of synthetic
imagery by developing solutions able to detect them. In this paper, we study
the possibility of using Benford's law to discriminate GAN-generated images
from natural photographs. Benford's law describes the distribution of the most
significant digit for quantized Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients.
Extending and generalizing this property, we show that it is possible to
extract a compact feature vector from an image. This feature vector can be fed
to an extremely simple classifier for GAN-generated image detection purpose.

What precisely is encoded in these latent variables expected to capture global

decomposing the reconstruction loss per position in the sentence. Using this

propose variants based on bag-of-words assumptions and language model

transitions in atoms. In particular, we demonstrate that the $5S_{1/2}\to
6S_{1/2}$ transition rate in a rubidium gas follows a quadratic dependency on
the helicity parameter linked to the polarization of the excitation light. For
excitation via a single Gaussian beam or two counterpropagating beams in a hot
vapor cell, the transition rate scales as the squared degree of linear
polarization. The rate reaches zero when the light is circularly polarized. In
contrast, when the excitation is realized via an evanescent field near an
optical nanofiber, the two-photon transition cannot be completely extinguished
(theoretically, not lower than 13\% of the maximum rate, under our experimental
conditions) by only varying the polarization of the fiber-guided light. Our
findings lead to a deeper understanding of the physics of multiphoton processes
in atoms in strongly nonparaxial light.

In this paper we address this limitation through a novel deep learning
approach, in which a recurrent deep neural network is trained to detect vital
signs in the infrared thermal domain from purely synthetic data. What is most
surprising is that our novel method for synthetic training data generation is
general, relatively simple and uses almost no prior medical domain knowledge.
Moreover, our system, which is trained in a purely automatic manner and needs
no human annotation, also learns to predict the respiration or heart intensity
signal for each moment in time and to detect the region of interest that is
most relevant for the given task, e.g. the nose area in the case of

  orthogonality and passiveness","  This paper clarifies the theoretical basis for constructing spiciness
variables optimal for characterising ocean water masses. Three essential
ingredients are identified: 1) a material density variable $\gamma$ that is as
neutral as feasible; 2) a material state function $\xi$ independent of
$\gamma$, but otherwise arbitrary; 3) an empirically determined function
$\xi_r(\gamma)$ of $\gamma$ quantifying the isopycnal mean behaviour of $\xi$.
The key results are: It is the anomaly $\xi' = \xi - \xi_r(\gamma)$, rather
than $\xi$, that is the variable optimally suited for characterising ocean
water masses; Ingredient 1) is required, because contrary to what is usually
assumed, it is not the property of $\xi$ that determine its dynamical
inertness, but the degree of neutrality of $\gamma$; Oceanic sections of $\xi'$
are rather insensitive to the particular choice of $\xi$; Contrary to what has
been usually assumed, it is orthogonality in physical space rather than in
thermohaline space that is the relevant property for optimally characterising
ocean water masses.
  The results are important because: They unify the various ways in which
spiciness has been defined and used in the literature; They provide for the
first time a rigorous first-principles physical justification for the concept

  cycles behind new daily COVID-19 cases and what happens after lockdown","  Spectral analysis characterises oscillatory time series behaviours such as
cycles, but accurate estimation requires reasonable numbers of observations.
Current COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and
post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially
interesting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem
of obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent Bayesian
spectral fusion methods. Here we show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases
for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of
around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show that the shorter cycles are
suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post lockdown differences suggest that
the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the
two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases
grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in
cases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or
more daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series
contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate
interventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general
technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates,
which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.

decades of research into the subject, it is still challenging to tackle the
robot locomotion problem from an algorithmic point of view. For example, these
machines cannot achieve a constant forward body movement without exploiting
contacts with the environment. The reactive forces resulting from the contacts
are subject to strong limitations, complicating the design of control laws. As
a consequence, the generation of humanoid motions requires to exploit fully the
mathematical model of the robot in contact with the environment or to resort to
approximations of it.
  This thesis investigates predictive and optimal control techniques for
tackling humanoid robot motion tasks. They generate control input values from
the system model and objectives, often transposed as cost function to minimize.
In particular, this thesis tackles several aspects of the humanoid robot
locomotion problem in a crescendo of complexity. First, we consider the single
step push recovery problem. Namely, we aim at maintaining the upright posture
with a single step after a strong external disturbance. Second, we generate and
stabilize walking motions. In addition, we adopt predictive techniques to
perform more dynamic motions, like large step-ups.
  The above-mentioned applications make use of different simplifications or
assumptions to facilitate the tractability of the corresponding motion tasks.
Moreover, they consider first the foot placements and only afterward how to
maintain balance. We attempt to remove all these simplifications. [continued]

  Computed Tomography (CT) image conversion","  Generalizability is a concern when applying a deep learning (DL) model
trained on one dataset to other datasets. Training a universal model that works
anywhere, anytime, for anybody is unrealistic. In this work, we demonstrate the
generalizability problem, then explore potential solutions based on transfer
learning (TL) by using the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) to computed
tomography (CT) image conversion task as the testbed. Previous works have
converted CBCT to CT-like images. However, all of those works studied only one
or two anatomical sites and used images from the same vendor's scanners. Here,
we investigated how a model trained for one machine and one anatomical site
works on other machines and other sites. We trained a model on CBCT images
acquired from one vendor's scanners for head and neck cancer patients and
applied it to images from another vendor's scanners and for other disease
sites. We found that generalizability could be a significant problem for this
particular application when applying a trained DL model to datasets from
another vendor's scanners. We then explored three practical solutions based on
TL to solve this generalization problem: the target model, which is trained on
a target domain from scratch; the combined model, which is trained on both
source and target domain datasets from scratch; and the adapted model, which
fine-tunes the trained source model to a target domain. We found that when
there are sufficient data in the target domain, all three models can achieve
good performance. When the target dataset is limited, the adapted model works
the best, which indicates that using the fine-tuning strategy to adapt the
trained model to an unseen target domain dataset is a viable and easy way to
implement DL models in the clinic.

  Self-Supervision","  Convolutional neural network-based approaches have achieved remarkable
progress in semantic segmentation. However, these approaches heavily rely on
annotated data which are labor intensive. To cope with this limitation,
automatically annotated data generated from graphic engines are used to train
segmentation models. However, the models trained from synthetic data are
difficult to transfer to real images. To tackle this issue, previous works have
considered directly adapting models from the source data to the unlabeled
target data (to reduce the inter-domain gap). Nonetheless, these techniques do
not consider the large distribution gap among the target data itself
(intra-domain gap). In this work, we propose a two-step self-supervised domain
adaptation approach to minimize the inter-domain and intra-domain gap together.
First, we conduct the inter-domain adaptation of the model; from this
adaptation, we separate the target domain into an easy and hard split using an
entropy-based ranking function. Finally, to decrease the intra-domain gap, we
propose to employ a self-supervised adaptation technique from the easy to the
hard split. Experimental results on numerous benchmark datasets highlight the
effectiveness of our method against existing state-of-the-art approaches. The

matter (DM) particles annihilate to an anti-DM, and an unstable state that can
mix with or decay to standard model states, can lead to particle anti-particle
asymmetry in the DM sector. The present DM abundance, including the
CP-violation in the DM sector and the resulting present asymmetry are
determined entirely by a single semi-annihilation process at next-to-leading
order. For large CP-violation in this process, we find that a nearly complete
asymmetry can be obtained in the DM sector, with the observed DM density being
dominated by the (anti-)DM particle. The presence of additional
pair-annihilation processes can modify the ratio of DM and anti-DM number
densities further, if the pair-annihilation is active subsequent to the
decoupling of the semi-annihilation. For such a scenario, the required
CP-violation for generating the same present asymmetry is generically much
smaller, as compared to the scenario with only semi-annihilation present. We
show that a minimal model with a complex scalar DM with cubic self-interactions
can give rise to both semi- and pair-annihilations, with the required
CP-violation generated at one-loop level. We also find that the upper bound on
the DM mass from S-matrix unitarity in the purely asymmetric semi-annihilation
scenario, with maximal CP-violation, is around 15 GeV, which is much stronger
than in the WIMP and previously considered asymmetric DM cases, due to the
required large non-zero chemical potential for such asymmetric DM.

back-propagation) of the object wave from the hologram recording plane to the
original object volume. While recording of a hologram involves transferring
information from a 3D volume to a 2D detector plane, the replay of the hologram
involves creating information in a set of 3D voxels from a much smaller number
of 2D detector pixels, which at first look appears to be surprising. We point
out that the hologram replay process is a Hermitian transpose (and not inverse)
of the hologram formation process and therefore only provides an approximation
to the original 3D object function. With the knowledge of this Hermitian
transpose property, we show how one may realize true 3D image reconstruction
via a regularized optimization algorithm. The numerical illustrations of this
optimization approach as presented here show excellent slice-by-slice
tomographic 3D reconstruction of the original object under the weak scattering
approximation. In particular, the reconstructed 3D image field has near-zero
numerical values at voxels where the original object did not exist. We note
that 3D image reconstruction of this kind cannot be achieved by the traditional
physical replay process. In this sense the proposed methodology for digital
holographic image reconstruction goes beyond numerically mimicking the
traditional film based holographic replay. The reconstruction approach may find
potential applications in a number of digital holographic imaging systems.

potential of increasing the spectral efficiency, relative to those with
half-duplex. However, the residual self-interference (SI) from FD and high
pathloss inherent to mmWave signals may degrade the system performance.
Meanwhile, hybrid beamforming (HBF) is an efficient technology to enhance the
channel gain and mitigate interference with reasonable complexity. However,
conventional HBF approaches for FD mmWave systems are based on optimization
processes, which are either too complex or strongly rely on the quality of
channel state information (CSI). We propose two learning schemes to design HBF
for FD mmWave systems, i.e., extreme learning machine based HBF (ELM-HBF) and
convolutional neural networks based HBF (CNN-HBF). Specifically, we first
propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm
to achieve SI cancellation beamforming, and then use a
majorization-minimization (MM) based algorithm for joint transmitting and
receiving HBF optimization. To train the learning networks, we simulate noisy
channels as input, and select the hybrid beamformers calculated by proposed
algorithms as targets. Results show that both learning based schemes can
provide more robust HBF performance and achieve at least 22.1% higher spectral
efficiency compared to orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithms. Besides,
the online prediction time of proposed learning based schemes is almost 20
times faster than the OMP scheme. Furthermore, the training time of ELM-HBF is
about 600 times faster than that of CNN-HBF with 64 transmitting and receiving

small coreset for k-Median in (the shortest-path metric of) an excluded-minor
graph. Specifically, we give the first coreset of size that depends only on
$k$, $\epsilon$ and the excluded-minor size, and our running time is
quasi-linear (in the size of the input graph).
  The main innovation in our new algorithm is that is iterative; it first
reduces the $n$ input points to roughly $O(\log n)$ reweighted points, then to
$O(\log\log n)$, and so forth until the size is independent of $n$. Each step
in this iterative size reduction is based on the importance sampling framework
of Feldman and Langberg (STOC 2011), with a crucial adaptation that reduces the
number of \emph{distinct points}, by employing a terminal embedding (where low
distortion is guaranteed only for the distance from every terminal to all other
points). Our terminal embedding is technically involved and relies on
shortest-path separators, a standard tool in planar and excluded-minor graphs.
  Furthermore, our new algorithm is applicable also in Euclidean metrics, by
simply using a recent terminal embedding result of Narayanan and Nelson, (STOC
2019), which extends the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. We thus obtain an
efficient coreset construction in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, thereby
matching and simplifying state-of-the-art results (Sohler and Woodruff, FOCS

  In addition, we also employ terminal embedding with additive distortion to
obtain small coresets in graphs with bounded highway dimension, and use
applications of our coresets to obtain improved approximation schemes, e.g., an
improved PTAS for planar k-Median via a new centroid set.

In modeling second-quantized problems, the biggest challenge confronted is that
the number of qubits scales linearly with the size of molecular basis. This
poses a significant limitation on the size of the basis sets and the number of

address this issue and to enable more realistic simulations on NISQ computers,

generation in the hot plasma core. For typical parameters, previous studies
found that the magnetisation Hall parameter, given by the product of the
electron gyro-frequency and Coulomb collision time, can exceed one. This will
affect the hydrodynamics through inhibition and deflection of the electron heat
flux. The magnetic field source is the collisionless Biermann term, which
arises from the Debye shielding potential in electron pressure gradients. We
show that there is an additional source term due to the Z dependence of the
Coulomb collision operator. If there are ion composition gradients, such as
jets of carbon ablator mix entering the hot-spot, this source term can rapidly
exceed the Biermann fields. In addition, the Biermann fields are enhanced due
to the increased temperature gradients from carbon radiative cooling. With even
stronger self-generated fields, heat loss to the carbon regions will be
reduced, potentially reducing the negative effect of carbon mix.

  Lines as Orientation Indicators","  Some tidal disruption events (TDEs) exhibit blueshifted broad absorption
lines (BALs) in their rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra, while others display
broad emission lines (BELs). Similar phenomenology is observed in quasars and
accreting white dwarfs, where it can be interpreted as an orientation effect
associated with line formation in an accretion disc wind.We propose and explore
a similar unification scheme for TDEs. We present synthetic UV spectra for disc
and wind-hosting TDEs, produced by a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo ionization
and radiative transfer code. Our models cover a wide range of disc wind
geometries and kinematics. Such winds naturally reproduce both BALs and BELs.
In general, sight lines looking into the wind cone preferentially produce BALs,
while other orientations preferentially produce BELs. We also study the effect
of wind clumping and CNO-processed abundances on the observed spectra. Clumpy
winds tend to produce stronger UV emission and absorption lines, because
clumping increases both the emission measure and the abundances of the relevant
ionic species, the latter by reducing the ionization state of the outflow. The
main effect of adopting CNO-processed abundances is a weakening of C~{\sc
iv}~1550~\AA~ and an enhancement of N \textsc{v}~1240~\AA~ in the spectra. We
conclude that line formation in an accretion disc wind is a promising mechanism
for explaining the diverse UV spectra of TDEs. If this is correct, the relative
number of BAL and BEL TDEs can be used to estimate the covering factor of the
outflow. The models in this work are publicly available online and upon

comparisons of pixels of a ""degraded"" image to those of the original. Relative
to human observers, these measures are overly sensitive to resampling of
texture regions (e.g., replacing one patch of grass with another). Here we
develop the first full-reference image quality model with explicit tolerance to
texture resampling. Using a convolutional neural network, we construct an
injective and differentiable function that transforms images to a multi-scale
overcomplete representation. We empirically show that the spatial averages of
the feature maps in this representation capture texture appearance, in that
they provide a set of sufficient statistical constraints to synthesize a wide
variety of texture patterns. We then describe an image quality method that
combines correlation of these spatial averages (""texture similarity"") with
correlation of the feature maps (""structure similarity""). The parameters of the
proposed measure are jointly optimized to match human ratings of image quality,
while minimizing the reported distances between subimages cropped from the same
texture images. Experiments show that the optimized method explains human
perceptual scores, both on conventional image quality databases, as well as on
texture databases. The measure also offers competitive performance on related
tasks such as texture classification and retrieval. Finally, we show that our
method is relatively insensitive to geometric transformations (e.g.,
translation and dilation), without use of any specialized training or data
augmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/dingkeyan93/DISTS.

to correct for the sample selection. We gave a detailed illustration of why
some early and highly influential analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic were

that 5% of the symptomatic cases may not develop symptoms within 14 days since
infection.

  Supranuclear Densities","  Recent observations of neutron stars with gravitational waves and X-ray
timing provide unprecedented access to the equation of state (EoS) of cold
dense matter at densities difficult to realize in terrestrial experiments. At
the same time, predictions for the EoS with reliable uncertainty estimates from
chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) bound our theoretical ignorance. In
this work, we analyze astrophysical data using a nonparametric representation
of the neutron star EoS conditioned on $\chi$EFT to directly constrain the
underlying physical properties of the compact objects. We discuss how the data
alone constrain the EoS at high densities when we condition on $\chi$EFT at low
densities. We also demonstrate how to exploit astrophysical data to directly
test the predictions of $\chi$EFT for the EoS up to twice nuclear saturation
density, and estimate the density at which these predictions might break down.
We find that the existence of massive pulsars, gravitational waves from
GW170817, and NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451 favor $\chi$EFT predictions
for the EoS up to nuclear saturation density over a more agnostic analysis by a
factor of 7 for the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations used in this work.
While $\chi$EFT predictions using QMC are fully consistent with
gravitational-wave data up to twice nuclear saturation, NICER observations
suggest that the EoS stiffens relative to these predictions at nuclear
saturation density. Additionally, we marginalize over the uncertainty in the
density at which $\chi$EFT begins to break down, constraining the radius of a
$1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star to $R_{1.4} = 11.40^{+1.38}_{-1.04}$

fields of science, giving rise to important applications in spectroscopy,
sensing, quantum information processing, and lasers. In most of these
applications, light is considered in terms of electromagnetic plane waves that
propagate at the speed of light in vacuum. As a result, light-matter
interactions can usually be treated as very weak, and captured at the lowest
order in quantum electrodynamics (QED). However, recent progress in coupling
photons to material quasiparticles (e.g., plasmons, phonons, and excitons)
forces us to generalize the way we picture the photon at the core of every
light-matter interaction. In this new picture, the photon, now of partly
matter-character, can have greatly different polarization and dispersion, and
be confined to the scale of a few nanometers. Such photonic quasiparticles
enable a wealth of light-matter interaction phenomena that could not have been
observed before, both in interactions with bound electrons and with free
electrons. This Review focuses on exciting theoretical and experimental
developments in realizing new light-matter interactions with photonic
quasiparticles. As just a few examples, we discuss how photonic quasiparticles
enable room-temperature strong coupling, ultrafast ""forbidden transitions"" in
atoms, and new applications of the Cherenkov effect, as well as breakthroughs
in ultrafast electron microscopy and new concepts for compact X-ray sources.

propose a new technique for transforming CHCs with ADTs into CHCs where
predicates are defined over basic types, such as integers and booleans, only.
Thus, our technique avoids the explicit use of inductive proof rules during
satisfiability proofs. The main extension over previous techniques for ADT
removal is a new transformation rule, called differential replacement, which
allows us to introduce auxiliary predicates corresponding to the lemmas that
are often needed when making inductive proofs. We present an algorithm that
uses the new rule, together with the traditional folding/unfolding
transformation rules, for the automatic removal of ADTs. We prove that if the
set of the transformed clauses is satisfiable, then so is the set of the
original clauses. By an experimental evaluation, we show that the use of the
differential replacement rule significantly improves the effectiveness of ADT
removal, and we show that our transformation-based approach is competitive with
respect to a well-established technique that extends the CVC4 solver with
induction.

apparent: Humans can generalize very broadly from sparse data sets because they
are able to recombine and reintegrate data components in compositional manners.
To investigate differences in efficient learning, Joshua B. Tenenbaum and
colleagues developed the character challenge: First an algorithm is trained in
generating handwritten characters. In a next step, one version of a new type of
character is presented. An efficient learning algorithm is expected to be able
to re-generate this new character, to identify similar versions of this
character, to generate new variants of it, and to create completely new
character types. In the past, the character challenge was only met by complex
algorithms that were provided with stochastic primitives. Here, we tackle the
challenge without providing primitives. We apply a minimal recurrent neural
network (RNN) model with one feedforward layer and one LSTM layer and train it
to generate sequential handwritten character trajectories from one-hot encoded
inputs. To manage the re-generation of untrained characters, when presented
with only one example of them, we introduce a one-shot inference mechanism: the
gradient signal is backpropagated to the feedforward layer weights only,
leaving the LSTM layer untouched. We show that our model is able to meet the
character challenge by recombining previously learned dynamic substructures,
which are visible in the hidden LSTM states. Making use of the compositional
abilities of RNNs in this way might be an important step towards bridging the
gap between human and artificial intelligence.

properties are necessary for developers to effectively understand, review, and
modify source code in large software projects. Consistent conventions in
verification projects based on proof assistants, such as Coq, increase in
importance as projects grow in size and scope. While conventions can be
documented and enforced manually at high cost, emerging approaches
automatically learn and suggest idiomatic names in Java-like languages by
applying statistical language models on large code corpora. However, due to its
powerful language extension facilities and fusion of type checking and
computation, Coq is a challenging target for automated learning techniques. We
present novel generation models for learning and suggesting lemma names for Coq
projects. Our models, based on multi-input neural networks, are the first to
leverage syntactic and semantic information from Coq's lexer (tokens in lemma
statements), parser (syntax trees), and kernel (elaborated terms) for naming;
the key insight is that learning from elaborated terms can substantially boost
model performance. We implemented our models in a toolchain, dubbed Roosterize,
and applied it on a large corpus of code derived from the Mathematical
Components family of projects, known for its stringent coding conventions. Our
results show that Roosterize substantially outperforms baselines for suggesting
lemma names, highlighting the importance of using multi-input models and
elaborated terms.

Examples include the discovery of the nucleus, crystallography, and the
discovery of the double helix structure of DNA. Scattering techniques differ by
the type of the particles used, the interaction these particles have with
target materials and the range of wavelengths used. Here, we demonstrate a new
2-dimensional table-top scattering platform for exploring magnetic properties
of materials on mesoscopic length scales. Long lived, coherent magnonic
excitations are generated in a thin film of YIG and scattered off a magnetic
target deposited on its surface. The scattered waves are then recorded using a
scanning NV center magnetometer that allows sub-wavelength imaging and
operation under conditions ranging from cryogenic to ambient environment. While
most scattering platforms measure only the intensity of the scattered waves,
our imaging method allows for spatial determination of both amplitude and phase
of the scattered waves thereby allowing for a systematic reconstruction of the
target scattering potential. Our experimental results are consistent with
theoretical predictions for such a geometry and reveal several unusual features
of the magnetic response of the target, including suppression near the target
edges and gradient in the direction perpendicular to the direction of surface
wave propagation. Our results establish magnon scattering experiments as a new
platform for studying correlated many-body systems.

of discriminant explanations is introduced. These produce heatmaps that
attribute high scores to image regions informative of a classifier prediction
but not of a counter class. They connect attributive explanations, which are
based on a single heat map, to counterfactual explanations, which account for
both predicted class and counter class. The latter are shown to be computable
by combination of two discriminant explanations, with reversed class pairs. It
is argued that self-awareness, namely the ability to produce classification
confidence scores, is important for the computation of discriminant
explanations, which seek to identify regions where it is easy to discriminate
between prediction and counter class. This suggests the computation of
discriminant explanations by the combination of three attribution maps. The
resulting counterfactual explanations are optimization free and thus much
faster than previous methods. To address the difficulty of their evaluation, a
proxy task and set of quantitative metrics are also proposed. Experiments under
this protocol show that the proposed counterfactual explanations outperform the
state of the art while achieving much higher speeds, for popular networks. In a

with the detector and the environment). Within this model one can understand
quite general features of the QZE and IZE: by considering an unstable quantum
state, such as an unstable particle, whose decay width as function of energy is
$\Gamma(\omega)=g^{2}\omega^{\alpha},$ then -- under quite general assumptions
-- the QZE occurs for $\alpha\in(0,1)$, while the IZE for $\alpha
\in(-\infty,0)\cup(1,\infty).$ This result is valid also for more realistic
measurement models than the one described in this work. We then apply these
considerations to the decay of the neutron, for which $\alpha=5.$ Hence, the
realization of the IZE for the neutron decay (and for the majority of weak
decays) is in principle possible. Indeed, trap experiments find a lifetime that
is $8.7\pm2.1$ s shorter than beam experiments, suggesting that the IZE could
have taken place.

important to find all functions of the parameters that are identifiable. The

material rheology, however, has still not been elucidated. Here, we take a new
approach relating trajectories to yielding, using a custom built interfacial
stress rheometer, which allows for measurement of shear moduli (G',G'') of a
dense athermal suspension's microstructure while simultaneously tracking
particle trajectories undergoing cyclic shear. We find an increase in total
area traced by particle trajectories as the system is stressed well below to
well above yield. Trajectories may be placed into three categories: reversibly
elastic paths; reversibly plastic paths, associated with smooth limit cycles;
and irreversibly plastic paths, in which particles do not return to their
original position. We find that above yield, reversibly plastic trajectories
are predominantly found near to the shearing surface, whereas reversibly
elastic paths are more prominent near the stationary wall. This spatial
transition between particles acting as solids to those acting as liquids is
characteristic of a 'melting front', which is observed to shift closer to the
wall with increasing strain. We introduce a non-dimensional measure of plastic
dissipation based on particle trajectories that scales linearly with strain
amplitude both above and below yield, and that is unity at the rheological
yield point. Surprisingly, this relation collapses for three systems of varying
degrees of disorder.

various applications. Under this scenario, in addition to the intrinsic
infinite-dimensionality of functional data, the number of functional variables
can grow with the number of serially dependent functional observations. In this
paper, we focus on the theoretical analysis of relevant estimated
cross-(auto)covariance terms between two multivariate functional time series or
a mixture of multivariate functional and scalar time series beyond the
Gaussianity assumption. We introduce a new perspective on dependence by
proposing functional cross-spectral stability measure to characterize the
effect of dependence on these estimated cross terms, which are essential in the
estimates for additive functional linear regressions. With the proposed
functional cross-spectral stability measure, we develop useful concentration
inequalities for estimated cross-(auto)covariance matrix functions to
accommodate more general sub-Gaussian functional linear processes and,
furthermore, establish finite sample theory for relevant estimated terms under
a commonly adopted functional principal component analysis framework. Using our
derived non-asymptotic results, we investigate the convergence properties of
the regularized estimates for two additive functional linear regression
applications under sparsity assumptions including functional linear lagged
regression and partially functional linear regression in the context of
high-dimensional functional/scalar time series.

side effects. Importantly, it has become an indispensable strategy to overcome
resistance in antibiotics, anti-microbials, and anti-cancer drugs. Facing
enormous chemical space and unclear design principles for small-molecule
combinations, the computational drug-combination design has not seen generative
models to meet its potential to accelerate resistance-overcoming drug
combination discovery. We have developed the first deep generative model for
drug combination design, by jointly embedding graph-structured domain knowledge
and iteratively training a reinforcement learning-based chemical graph-set
designer. First, we have developed Hierarchical Variational Graph Auto-Encoders
(HVGAE) trained end-to-end to jointly embed gene-gene, gene-disease, and
disease-disease networks. Novel attentional pooling is introduced here for
learning disease-representations from associated genes' representations.
Second, targeting diseases in learned representations, we have recast the
drug-combination design problem as graph-set generation and developed a deep
learning-based model with novel rewards. Specifically, besides chemical
validity rewards, we have introduced a novel generative adversarial award,
being generalized sliced Wasserstein, for chemically diverse molecules with
distributions similar to known drugs. We have also designed a network
principle-based reward for drug combinations. Numerical results indicate that,
compared to graph embedding methods, HVGAE learns more informative and
generalizable disease representations. Case studies on four diseases show that
network-principled drug combinations tend to have low toxicity. The generated
drug combinations collectively cover the disease module similar to FDA-approved
drug combinations and could potentially suggest novel systems-pharmacology
strategies.

due to the difficult nature of obtaining training data, no ground truth dataset

In addition, a lack of 3D animal pose data also makes it difficult to train 3D

from RGBD images, recording a diverse range of dog breeds with several

locations, which is then constrained using prior models of shape and pose. We
evaluate our model on both synthetic and real RGBD images and compare our
results to previously published work fitting canine models to images. Finally,
despite our training set consisting only of dog data, visual inspection implies
that our network can produce good predictions for images of other quadrupeds --

$k$:$k-1$ among exoplanets become unstable once the dissipative action from the
gas is removed from the system, particularly for large $N$ (the number of
planets) and $k$ (indicating how compact the chain is). We present a novel
dynamical mechanism that can explain the origin of these instabilities and thus
the dearth of resonant systems in the exoplanet sample. It relies on the
emergence of secondary resonances between a fraction of the synodic frequency
$2 \pi (1/P_1-1/P_2)$ and the libration frequencies in the mean motion
resonance. These secondary resonances excite the amplitudes of libration of the
mean motion resonances thus leading to an instability. We detail the emergence
of these secondary resonances by carrying out an explicit perturbative scheme
to second order in the planetary masses and isolating the harmonic terms that
are associated with them. Focusing on the case of three planets in the 3:2 --
3:2 mean motion resonance as an example, a simple but general analytical model
of one of these resonances is obtained which describes the initial phase of the
activation of one such secondary resonance. The dynamics of the excited system
is also briefly described. This scheme shows how one can obtain analytical
insight into the emergence of these resonances, and into the dynamics that they
trigger. Finally, a generalisation of this dynamical mechanism is obtained for
arbitrary $N$ and $k$. This leads to an explanation of previous numerical
experiments on the stability of resonant chains, showing why the critical
planetary mass allowed for stability decreases with increasing $N$ and $k$.

networks even when only considering the hypothesis and ignoring the premise,
leading to unwanted biases. Previous work proposed tackling this problem via
adversarial training, but this leads to learned sentence representations that
still suffer from the same biases. As a solution, we propose using an ensemble
of adversaries during the training, encouraging the model to jointly decrease
the accuracy of these different adversaries while fitting the data. We show
that using an ensemble of adversaries can prevent the bias from being relearned
after the model training is completed, further improving how well the model
generalises to different NLI datasets. In particular, these models outperformed
previous approaches when tested on 12 different NLI datasets not used in the
model training. Finally, the optimal number of adversarial classifiers depends
on the dimensionality of the sentence representations, with larger dimensional
representations benefiting when trained with a greater number of adversaries.

for three important fractal dimensions. Let $X$ be a separable metric space,
and let $\mathcal{K}(X)$ be the \emph{hyperspace} of $X$, i.e., the set of all
nonempty compact subsets of $X$, endowed with the Hausdorff metric. For the
lower and upper Minkowski (i.e., box-counting) dimensions, we give precise
formulas for the dimension of $\mathcal{K}(E)$, where $E$ is any subset of $X$.
For packing dimension, we give a tight bound on the dimension of
$\mathcal{K}(E)$ in terms of the dimension of $E$, where $E$ is any analytic
(i.e., $\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_1$) subset of $X$. These results also hold for a
large class of gauge families (Hausdorff families of gauge functions).
  The logical structures of our proofs are of particular interest. We first
extend two algorithmic fractal dimensions--computability-theoretic versions of
classical Hausdorff and packing dimensions that assign dimensions $\dim(x)$ and
$\textrm{Dim}(x)$ to individual points $x \in X$--to arbitrary separable metric
spaces and to arbitrary gauge families. We then extend the point-to-set
principle of J. Lutz and N. Lutz (2018) to arbitrary separable metric spaces
and to a large class of gauge families. Finally, we use this principle to prove
our hyperspace packing dimension theorem. This is one of a handful of
cases--all very recent and all using the point-to-set principle--in which the
theory of computing has been used to prove new theorems in classical geometric
measure theory, theorems whose statements do not involve computation or logic.

interest due to its potential for sample efficiency and ability to incorporate

rich function approximators have remained challenging. To help expose the
practical challenges in MBRL and simplify algorithm design from the lens of
abstraction, we develop a new framework that casts MBRL as a game between: (1)
a policy player, which attempts to maximize rewards under the learned model;
(2) a model player, which attempts to fit the real-world data collected by the
policy player. For algorithm development, we construct a Stackelberg game
between the two players, and show that it can be solved with approximate
bi-level optimization. This gives rise to two natural families of algorithms
for MBRL based on which player is chosen as the leader in the Stackelberg game.
Together, they encapsulate, unify, and generalize many previous MBRL
algorithms. Furthermore, our framework is consistent with and provides a clear
basis for heuristics known to be important in practice from prior works.
Finally, through experiments we validate that our proposed algorithms are
highly sample efficient, match the asymptotic performance of model-free policy
gradient, and scale gracefully to high-dimensional tasks like dexterous hand
manipulation.

high-order many-body perturbation theory calculations with consistent
nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions up to fourth order in the
$\chi$EFT expansion. From these calculations our newly developed Bayesian

free-space nucleon-nucleon scattering. These significant advances allow us to
provide posterior distributions for the nuclear saturation point and propagate
theoretical uncertainties to derived quantities: the pressure and
incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter, the nuclear symmetry energy, and
its derivative. Our results, which are validated by statistical diagnostics,
demonstrate that an understanding of truncation-error correlations between
different densities and different observables is crucial for reliable UQ. The

  contrast agents at nearly resonating frequencies","  We analyze mathematically the acoustic imaging modality using bubbles as
contrast agents. These bubbles are modeled by mass densities and bulk moduli
enjoying contrasting scales. These contrasting scales allow them to resonate at
certain incident frequencies. We consider two types of such contrasts. In the
first one, the bubbles are light with small bulk modulus, as compared to the
ones of the background, so that they generate the Minnaert resonance
(corresponding to a local surface wave). In the second one, the bubbles have
moderate mass density but still with small bulk modulus so that they generate a
sequence of resonances (corresponding to local body waves).
  We propose to use as measurements the far-fields collected before and after
injecting a bubble, set at a given location point in the target domain,
generated at a band of incident frequencies and at a fixed single
backscattering direction. Then, we scan the target domain with such bubbles and
collect the corresponding far-fields. The goal is to reconstruct both the,
variable, mass density and bulk modulus of the background in the target region.
  1. We show that, for each fixed used bubble, the contrasted far-fields reach
their maximum value at, incident, frequencies close to the Minneart resonance
(or the body-wave resonances depending on the types of bubbles we use). Hence,
we can reconstruct this resonance from our data. The explicit dependence of the
Minnaert resonance in terms of the background mass density of the background
allows us to recover it, i.e. the mass density, in a straightforward way.
  2. In addition, this measured contrasted far-fields allow us to recover the
total field at the location points of the bubbles (i.e. the total field in the
absence of the bubbles). A numerical differentiation argument, for instance,
allows us to recover the bulk modulus of the targeted region as well.

tracking formulation, these issues are solved by the addition of an artificial
equilibrium point as a new decision variable, providing a significantly
enlarged domain of attraction and guaranteeing recursive feasibility for any

prediction horizon is not large enough. This paper presents an extension of
this formulation where a harmonic artificial reference is used in place of the

  cosmological analysis of large scale structures","  We present a mitigation strategy to reduce the impact of non-linear galaxy
bias on the joint `$3 \times 2 $pt' cosmological analysis of weak lensing and
galaxy surveys. The $\Psi$-statistics that we adopt are based on Complete
Orthogonal Sets of E/B Integrals (COSEBIs). As such they are designed to
minimise the contributions to the observable from the smallest physical scales
where models are highly uncertain. We demonstrate that $\Psi$-statistics carry
the same constraining power as the standard two-point galaxy clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing statistics, but are significantly less sensitive to
scale-dependent galaxy bias. Using two galaxy bias models, motivated by
halo-model fits to data and simulations, we quantify the error in a standard $3
\times 2$pt analysis where constant galaxy bias is assumed. Even when adopting
conservative angular scale cuts, that degrade the overall cosmological
parameter constraints, we find of order $1 \sigma$ biases for Stage III surveys
on the cosmological parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{\alpha}$.
This arises from a leakage of the smallest physical scales to all angular
scales in the standard two-point correlation functions. In contrast, when
analysing $\Psi$-statistics under the same approximation of constant galaxy
bias, we show that the bias on the recovered value for $S_8$ can be decreased
by a factor of $\sim 2$, with less conservative scale cuts. Given the
challenges in determining accurate galaxy bias models in the highly non-linear
regime, we argue that $3 \times 2$pt analyses should move towards new
statistics that are less sensitive to the smallest physical scales.

believed to be a property of gravitational (or string) theories, but not of
non-gravitational theories; specifically Marolf has argued that it originates
from the gauge symmetries and constraints of gravity. These observations
suggest study of the assumed holographic map as a function of the gravitational
coupling $G$. The zero coupling limit gives ordinary quantum field theory, and
is therefore not necessarily expected to be holographic. This, and the
structure of gravity at non-zero $G$, raises important questions about the full
map. In particular, construction of a holographic map appears to require as
input a solution of the nonperturbative analog of the bulk gravitational
constraints, that is, the unitary bulk evolution. Moreover, examination of the
candidate boundary algebra, including the boundary hamiltonian, reveals
commutators that don't close in the usual fashion expected for a boundary

the presence of a monodromy, the self-interactions of ALPs can be sufficiently
strong such that the homogeneous field fragments soon after the onset of
oscillations. The resulting large inhomogeneities can lead to the production of
gravitational waves (GWs). We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of
fragmentation, as well as of the subsequent turbulent regime, and calculate the
stochastic GW background that is produced from this process. The GW background
can be enhanced if the time evolution features an extended intermediate phase
of ultrarelativistic dynamics due to a small mass at the bottom of the

possibility of creating effective superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor
junctions with tunable Zeeman splitting caused by an in-plane magnetic field.
Such junctions would be able to alternate between a conventional
superconducting ground state and a ground state with an intrinsic phase
difference, making them controllable $0-\pi$ Josephson junctions. However, in
addition to the Zeeman splitting, an in-plane magnetic field will in general
also produce an orbital effect because of height variations in graphene,
colloquially known as ripples. Both the Zeeman and orbital effect will thus
affect the critical current, so to be able to identify $0-\pi$ transitions it
is necessary to understand their combined effect. From both analytical and
numerical solutions of the Usadel equation we find that ripples can in fact
produce a current response similar to that which is characteristic of a $0-\pi$
transition. Hence, additional analysis is required in order to reveal the
presence of a $0-\pi$ transition caused by spin-splitting in graphene with
ripples. We provide a closed form analytical expression for the critical

expression for the scaling of critical current zeroes with junction parameters.

$z=0$ but also analyze other masses and redshifts up to $z=5$. We find that the
CGM angular momentum properties are strongly correlated with the stellar
angular momentum of the corresponding galaxy: the CGM surrounding high-angular
momentum galaxies has systematically higher angular momentum and is better
aligned to the rotational axis of the galaxy itself than the CGM surrounding
low-angular momentum galaxies. Both the hot and cold phases of the CGM show
this dichotomy, though it is stronger for colder gas. The CGM of high-angular
momentum galaxies is characterized by a large wedge of cold gas with rotational
velocities at least $\sim1/2$ of the halo's virial velocity extending out to
$\sim 1/2$ of the virial radius, and by biconical polar regions dominated by
radial velocities suggestive of galactic fountains; both of these features are
absent from the CGM of low-angular momentum galaxies. These conclusions are
general to halo masses $\lesssim 10^{12} \; M_{\odot}$ and for $z \lesssim 2$,
but do not apply for more massive halos or at the highest redshift studied. By
comparing simulations run with alterations to the fiducial feedback model, we
identify the better alignment of the CGM to high-angular momentum galaxies as a
feedback-independent effect and the galactic winds as a dominant influence on

and S0s/lenticulars -- define a Fundamental Plane (FP) in the space of
half-light radius $R_e$, enclosed surface brightness $I_e$ and velocity
dispersion $\sigma_e$. Since $I_e$ and $\sigma_e$ are distance-independent
measurements, the thickness of the FP is often expressed in terms of the
accuracy with which $I_e$ and $\sigma_e$ can be used to estimate sizes $R_e$.
We show that: 1) The thickness of the FP depends strongly on morphology. If the
sample only includes E-SRs, then the observed scatter in $R_e$ is $\sim 16\%$,
of which only $\sim 9\%$ is intrinsic. Removing galaxies with
$M_*<10^{11}M_\odot$ further reduces the observed scatter to $\sim 13\%$ ($\sim
4\%$ intrinsic). The observed scatter increases to the $\sim 25\%$ usually
quoted in the literature if E-FRs and S0s are added. If the FP is defined using
the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the observables, then the E-SRs
again define an exceptionally thin FP, with intrinsic scatter of only $5\%$
orthogonal to the plane. 2) The structure within the FP is most easily
understood as arising from the fact that $I_e$ and $\sigma_e$ are nearly
independent, whereas the $R_e-I_e$ and $R_e-\sigma_e$ correlations are nearly
equal and opposite. 3) If the coefficients of the FP differ from those
associated with the virial theorem the plane is said to be `tilted'. If we
multiply $I_e$ by the global stellar mass-to-light ratio $M_*/L$ and we account
for non-homology across the population by using S\'ersic photometry, then the
resulting stellar mass FP is less tilted. Accounting self-consistently for
$M_*/L$ gradients will change the tilt. The tilt we currently see suggests that
the efficiency of turning baryons into stars increases and/or the dark matter
fraction decreases as stellar surface brightness increases.

companions. Observations show that these binaries, triples and higher-order
multiples are common. Whereas the evolution of single stars and binaries have
been studied extensively, the same is not true for the evolution of stellar
triples. To fill this gap in our general understanding of stellar lives, we aim
to systematically explore the long-term evolution of triples and to map out the
most common evolutionary pathways that triples go through. We quantitatively
study how triples evolve, which processes are most relevant, and how this
differs from binary evolution. We simulate the evolution of several large
populations of triples with a population synthesis approach. We make use of the
triple evolution code TRES to simulate the evolution of each triple in a
consistent way; including three-body dynamics (based on the secular approach),
stellar evolution and their mutual influences. We simulate the evolution of the
system up until mass transfer starts, the system becomes dynamically unstable,
or a Hubble time has passed. We find that stellar interactions are common in
triples. Compared to a binary population, we find that the fraction of systems
that can undergo mass transfer is about 2 to 3 times larger in triples.
Moreover, whereas in binaries the orbits typically reach circularisation before
Roche-lobe overflow, this is not true anymore in triples. In our simulations,
about 40% of systems retain an eccentric orbit. Additionally, we discuss
various channels of triple evolution in detail such as those where the
secondary or the tertiary is the first star to initiate a mass transfer event.

critical fluctuation in the bulk also yields effective nonlocal interactions at
the boundary. This work studies the edge states at the $1d$ boundary of $2d$

that by tuning one parameter at the boundary, there is a generic direct

Bayesian mass-mapping formalism presented in previous work to the spherical

We apply our framework to convergence reconstruction on high resolution N-body

service process. In this paper, we propose, develop, and compare new stochastic
models for the co-production of service in a contact center. Using insights
from service communication data, we model the service interactions using
self-exciting and mutually exciting bivariate Hawkes processes, so that a
correspondence from one party increases the likelihood of a response from the
other party soon after. Moreover, our models incorporate both dynamic busyness
factors that depend on the agent workload as well as dynamic factors that
depend on the inner-mechanics of the interaction. To understand how well our
Hawkes models describe the message-timestamps, we compare the goodness-of-fit
of these models on contact center data from industry. We show that the
word-count bivariate Hawkes model, which takes into account the mutual
interaction and the amount of information provided by each party, fits the data
the best. In addition to a great goodness-of-fit, the Hawkes models allow us to
construct explicit expressions for the relationship between the correspondence
rates of each party and the conversation progress. These formulae illustrate
that the agent is more dominant in pacing the service along in the short term,
but that the customer has a more profound effect on the duration of the
conversation in the long run. Finally, we use our models to predict the future
level of activity within a given conversation, through which we find that the
bivariate Hawkes processes that incorporate the amount of information provided

symmetry is very well-motivated since it naturally explains the presence of
heavy right-handed neutrinos required to account for the small active neutrino
masses via the seesaw mechanism and thermal leptogenesis. Traditionally, we
introduce three right handed neutrinos to cancel the $[U(1)_{\rm B-L}]^3$
anomaly. However, it suffices to introduce two heavy right-handed neutrinos for
these purposes and therefore we can replace one right-handed neutrino by new
chiral fermions to cancel the $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ gauge anomaly. Then, one of the
chiral fermions can naturally play a role of a dark matter candidate. In this
paper, we demonstrate how this framework produces a dark matter candidate which
can address the so-called ""core-cusp problem"". As one of the small scale
problems that $\Lambda$CDM paradigm encounters, it may imply an important clue
for a nature of dark matter. One of resolutions among many is hypothesizing
that sub-keV fermion dark matter halos in dwarf spheroidal galaxies are in
(quasi) degenerate configuration. We show how the degenerate sub-keV fermion
dark matter candidate can be non-thermally originated in our model and thus can
be consistent with Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observation. Thereby, the small
neutrino mass, baryon asymmetry, and the sub-keV dark matter become
consequences of the broken B-L gauge symmetry.

Additionally, the galaxy distribution and the gas present elongated

which induced a local boost of the gas pressure towards the north of XLSSC102
and stripped the gas out of the galaxy group. The NIKA2 data are also combined
with XXL data to construct the thermodynamic profiles of XLSSC102, obtaining
relatively tight constraints up to about $\sim r_{500}$, and revealing
properties that are typical of disturbed systems. We also explore the impact of

substructure on the recovered profiles. Finally, we derive the global
properties of XLSSC102 and compare them to those of high-mass-and-low-redshift

them the production of non-genuine or contaminated products and meats, there is
a need to develop effective solutions for ensuring authenticity and quality.
This paper proposes the specification of a formalized supply chain framework
for the production and monitoring of food and products. The latter enforces
high-level quality of automated monitoring as well as shorter production cycles
through enhanced coordination between the actors and organizations involved.
Our proposal is guided by business process support to ensure quality and
efficiency of product development and delivery. It moreover meets the
requirements of industrial standards by adopting the Capability Maturity Model
Integration highest process maturity level through establishing quantitative
process-improvement objectives, proposing the integrated support of engineering
processes, enforcing synchronization and coordination, drastic monitoring and
exception handling. We then delve into some of the important technologies from
the implementation point-of-view and align it with the formalized Halal
framework. An Information Technology support instantiation is proposed leading
to a use case scenario with technology identification.

for testing and learning quantum states that achieve optimal copy complexity.
Unfortunately, they require the use of entangled measurements across many
copies of the underlying state and thus remain outside the realm of what is
currently experimentally feasible. A natural question is whether one can match
the copy complexity of such algorithms using only independent---but possibly
adaptively chosen---measurements on individual copies.
  We answer this in the negative for arguably the most basic quantum testing
problem: deciding whether a given $d$-dimensional quantum state is equal to or
$\epsilon$-far in trace distance from the maximally mixed state. While it is
known how to achieve optimal $O(d/\epsilon^2)$ copy complexity using entangled
measurements, we show that with independent measurements,
$\Omega(d^{4/3}/\epsilon^2)$ is necessary, even if the measurements are chosen
adaptively. This resolves a question of Wright. To obtain this lower bound, we
develop several new techniques, including a chain-rule style proof of
Paninski's lower bound for classical uniformity testing, which may be of
independent interest.

probabilistic characterization of the ill-conditioning of the problem,
comprising the sensitivity of the solution with respect to the starting model
and data noise. This analysis allows to assess the confidence in the candidate
solution and how it is reflected in the tasks that are typically performed
after imaging (e.g., stratigraphic segmentation following reservoir
characterization). Classically, uncertainty comes in the form of a probability
distribution formulated from Bayesian principles, from which we seek to obtain
samples. A popular solution involves Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose
instead an approach characterized by training a deep network that ""pushes
forward"" Gaussian random inputs into the model space (representing, for
example, density or velocity) as if they were sampled from the actual posterior
distribution. Such network is designed to solve a variational optimization
problem based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior and the
network output distributions. This work is fundamentally rooted in recent
developments for invertible networks. Special invertible architectures, besides
being computational advantageous with respect to traditional networks, do also
enable analytic computation of the output density function. Therefore, after
training, these networks can be readily used as a new prior for a related
inversion problem. This stands in stark contrast with Monte-Carlo methods,
which only produce samples. We validate these ideas with an application to
angle-versus-ray parameter analysis for reservoir characterization.

consider cascading dynamics on modular, degree-heterogeneous networks, as such

only one dynamical variable per module, namely the conditional exposure

ability of a cascade to fully activate other modules is determined by the
extent of large-scale interconnection between modules and is independent of how

improved over the years through computer simulations. Such simulators represent
complex mathematical models that are implemented as computer codes which are
often expensive. The validity of using a particular simulator to draw accurate
conclusions relies on the assumption that the computer code is correctly
calibrated. This calibration procedure is often pursued under extensive
experimentation and comparison with data from a real-world process. The problem
is that the data collection may be so expensive that only a handful of
experiments are feasible. History matching is a calibration technique that,
given a simulator, it iteratively discards regions of the input space using an
implausibility measure. When the simulator is computationally expensive, an
emulator is used to explore the input space. In this paper, a Gaussian process
provides a complete probabilistic output that is incorporated into the
implausibility measure. The identification of regions of interest is
accomplished with recently developed annealing sampling techniques. Active
learning functions are incorporated into the history matching procedure to
refocus on the input space and improve the emulator. The efficiency of the
proposed framework is tested in well-known examples from the history matching
literature, as well as in a proposed testbed of functions of higher dimensions.

such as experimental design, fair allocation of goods, network design, and
machine learning. The current best results include an $e^{2k}$-estimation for
any matroid of rank $k$ and a $(1+\epsilon)^d$-approximation for a uniform
matroid of rank $k\ge d+\frac d\epsilon$, where the rank $k\ge d$ denotes the
desired size of the optimal set. Our main result is a new approximation
algorithm with an approximation guarantee that depends only on the dimension
$d$ of the vectors and not on the size $k$ of the output set. In particular, we
show an $(O(d))^{d}$-estimation and an $(O(d))^{d^3}$-approximation for any
matroid, giving a significant improvement over prior work when $k\gg d$.
  Our result relies on the existence of an optimal solution to a convex
programming relaxation for the problem which has sparse support; in particular,
no more than $O(d^2)$ variables of the solution have fractional values. The
sparsity results rely on the interplay between the first-order optimality
conditions for the convex program and matroid theory. We believe that the
techniques introduced to show sparsity of optimal solutions to convex programs
will be of independent interest. We also give a randomized algorithm that
rounds a sparse fractional solution to a feasible integral solution to the
original problem. To show the approximation guarantee, we utilize recent works
on strongly log-concave polynomials and show new relationships between
different convex programs studied for the problem. Finally, we use the
estimation algorithm and sparsity results to give an efficient deterministic
approximation algorithm with an approximation guarantee that depends solely on
the dimension $d$.

cross-correlation analysis confirms previous results showing that the X-rays
are delayed relative to the UV continuum at 1315 $\r{A}$ by 3.49 $\pm$ 0.22

comptonisation. However, if variations slower than 5 days are removed from the
X-ray lightcurve, the UV variations then lag behind the X-rays variations by
0.37$\pm$0.14 day, consistent with reprocessing of the X-rays by a surrounding
accretion disc. A very similar reverberation delay is observed between ${\it
Swift}$/XRT X-ray and ${\it Swift}$/UVOT UVW2, U lightcurves. Continuum
lightcurves extracted from the ${\it Swift}$/GRISM spectra show delays with
respect to X-rays consistent with reverberation. Separating the UV continuum
variations faster and slower than 5 days, the slow variations at 1825 $\r{A}$
lag those at 1315 $\r{A}$ by $0.29\pm0.06$ day, while the fast variations are

predicted for the standard accretion disc theory while the best-fit X-ray delay

$\sim$0.38 days from the standard disc delay prediction.

focus on a strong adaptive behaviour, implementing two types of quarantine
inspired by recent real case studies: an active quarantine, in which the
population compensates the loss of links rewiring the ineffective connections
towards non-quarantining nodes, and an inactive quarantine, in which the links
with quarantined nodes are not rewired. Both strategies feature the same
epidemic threshold but they strongly differ in the dynamics of active phase. We
show that the active quarantine is extremely less effective in reducing the
impact of the epidemic in the active phase compared to the inactive one, and
that in SIR model a late adoption of measures requires inactive quarantine to
reach containment.

data is plentiful, but it is not always known which features will be required
for downstream tasks. We propose a method for divergent search in the few-shot

high-dimensional behavior space includes all possible ways of partitioning the

The final layer of this model is used as an index into the `archive' of all

archive cannot reach. As expected, divergent search is outperformed by models
with a strong bias toward the evaluation tasks. But it is able to match and
sometimes exceed the performance of models that have a weak bias toward the
target task or none at all. This demonstrates that divergent search is a viable
approach, even in high-dimensional behavior spaces.

macroscopic properties. We use two different stochastic time series models,
parameterized from long molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories of a
cross-linked H$_{II}$ phase lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane, in order
to predict solute mean squared displacements (MSDs) and solute flux, and thus
solute selectivity, in macroscopic length pores.
  First, using anomalous diffusion theory, we show how solute dynamics can be
modeled as a fractional diffusion process subordinate to a continuous time
random walk. From the MD simulations, we parameterize the distribution of dwell
times, hop lengths between dwells and correlation between hops. We explore two
variations of the anomalous diffusion modeling approach. The first applies a
single set of parameters to the solute displacements and the second applies two
sets of parameters based on the solute's radial distance from the closest pore
center.
  Next, we generalize Markov state models, treating the configurational states
of the system as a Markov process where each state has distinct transport
properties. For each state and transition between states, we parameterize the
distribution and temporal correlation structure of positional fluctuations as a
means of characterization and to allow us to predict solute MSDs. Qualitative
differences between MD and Markov state dependent model-generated trajectories
may limit its usefulness.
  Finally, we demonstrate how one can use these models to estimate flux of a
solute across a macroscopic-length pore and, based on those quantities, the
membrane's selectivity towards each solute. This work helps to connect
microscopic chemically-dependent solute motions that do not follow simple
diffusive behavior with macroscopic membrane performance.

one approach is radiance assimilation, the information content of GOES-R
radiances from its Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) saturates in precipitating
scenes, and radiance assimilation does not make use of lightning observations
from the GOES Lightning Mapper (GLM). Here, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is developed to transform GOES-R radiances and lightning into synthetic
radar reflectivity fields to make use of existing radar assimilation
techniques. We find that the ability of CNNs to utilize spatial context is
essential for this application and offers breakthrough improvement in skill
compared to traditional pixel-by-pixel based approaches. To understand the
improved performance, we use a novel analysis methodology that combines several
techniques, each providing different insights into the network's reasoning.
Channel withholding experiments and spatial information withholding experiments
are used to show that the CNN achieves skill at high reflectivity values from
the information content in radiance gradients and the presence of lightning.
The attribution method, layer-wise relevance propagation, demonstrates that the
CNN uses radiance and lightning information synergistically, where lightning
helps the CNN focus on which neighboring locations are most important.
Synthetic inputs are used to quantify the sensitivity to radiance gradients,
showing that sharper gradients produce a stronger response in predicted
reflectivity. Finally, geostationary lightning observations are found to be
uniquely valuable for their ability to pinpoint locations of strong radar

extragalactic neutrino may indicate the source of UHECRs being an extragalactic
supermassive black hole (SMBH). We demonstrate that ultra-efficient energy
extraction from rotating SMBH driven by the magnetic Penrose process (MPP)
could indeed foot the bill. We envision ionization of neutral particles, such
as neutron beta-decay, skirting close to the black hole horizon that energizes
protons to over $10^{20}$eV for SMBH of mass $10^9 M_{\odot}$ and magnetic
field of strength $10^4$G. Applied to Galactic center SMBH we have proton
energy of order $\approx 10^{15.6}$eV that coincides with the knee of the
cosmic ray spectra. We show that large $\gamma_z$ factors of high-energy
particles along the escaping directions occur only in the presence of induced
charge of the black hole that is known as the Wald charge in the case of
uniform magnetic field. It is remarkable that the process neither requires
extended acceleration zone, nor fine-tuning of accreting matter parameters.
Further, this leads to certain verifiable constraints on SMBH's mass and
magnetic field strength as UHECRs sources. This clearly makes ultra-efficient
regime of MPP one of the most promising mechanisms for fueling UHECRs

dwarf novae: UZ Ser in outburst, decline, and quiescence, and CY Lyr on the
rise to outburst and in outburst. We fit the Balmer jump and absorption lines,
the continuum flux level and slope by adjusting the accretion rate,
inclination, and disc outer radius. For both systems we find an accretion rate
$\dot{M} \approx 8 \times 10^{-9}M_\odot$/yr in outburst, and $\dot{M} \approx
2-3 \times 10^{-9}M_\odot$/yr for the rise and decline phases. The outer disc
radius we derive is smaller than expected ($R_{\rm disc} \approx 0.2a$, where
$a$ is the binary separation), except during late rise (for CY Lyr) where
$R_{\rm disc}=0.3a$. UZ Ser also reveals a 60,000~K white dwarf. These results
show that during a dwarf nova cycle the radius of the disc is the largest just
before the peak of the outburst, in qualitative agreement with the disc
instability model for dwarf nova outbursts. We suspect that an additional
emitting component (e.g. disc wind) is also at work to reduce the slope of the
continuum and size of the Balmer jump and absorption lines. We stress that both
the outer disc radius and disc wind need to be taken into account for more
realistic disc modeling of CVs.

these models for room-temperature rat and for body-temperature human cells. We
show, by means of numerical simulations, that the proposed models correctly
predict the main features of force generation, including the steady-state
force-calcium and force-length relationships, the tension-dependent
prolongation of twitches, the force-velocity relationship. Moreover, they
correctly reproduce the Frank-Starling effect, when employed in multiscale 3D
numerical simulation of cardiac electromechanics.

  HetNets","  The recent development in Internet of Things necessitates caching of dynamic
contents, where new versions of contents become available around-the-clock and
thus timely update is required to ensure their relevance. The age of
information (AoI) is a performance metric that evaluates the freshness of
contents. Existing works on AoI-optimization of cache content update algorithms
focus on minimizing the long-term average AoI of all cached contents. Sometimes
user requests that need to be served in the future are known in advance and can
be stored in user request queues. In this paper, we propose dynamic cache
content update scheduling algorithms that exploit the user request queues. We
consider a special use case where the trained neural networks (NNs) from deep
learning models are being cached in a heterogeneous network. A queue-aware
cache content update scheduling algorithm based on Markov decision process
(MDP) is developed to minimize the average AoI of the NNs delivered to the
users plus the cost related to content updating. By using deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), we propose a low complexity suboptimal scheduling algorithm.
Simulation results show that, under the same update frequency, our proposed
algorithms outperform the periodic cache content update scheme and reduce the
average AoI by up to 35%.

of a 2-year observational programme, the ITP13, developed at the Roque de los
Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain). We characterise 75 SZ sources with low
SZ significance, SZ S/N$<5.32$ by performing deep optical imaging and
spectroscopy in order to associate actual galaxy clusters to the SZ Planck
source. We adopt robust criteria, based on the 2D-spatial distribution,
richness and velocity dispersions to confirm actual optical counterparts up to
$z<0.85$. At the end of the ITP13 observational programme, we study 256 SZ
sources with $Dec \geq -15^{\circ}$ (212 of them completely unknown), finding
optical counterparts for 152 SZ sources. The ITP13 validation programme has
allowed us to update the PSZ1 purity, which is now more refined, increasing
from 72\% to 83\% in the low SZ S/N regime. Our results are consistent with the
predicted purity curve for the full PSZ1 catalogue and with the expected
fraction of false detections caused by the non-Gaussian noise of foreground
signals. Indeed, we find a strong correlation between the number of unconfirmed
sources and the thermal emission of diffuse galactic dust at 857 GHz, thus
increasing the fraction of false Planck SZ detections at low galactic
latitudes.

based on data from Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) along with a
detection of bright, unresolved radio emission from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey
(NVSS) or Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) Survey.
Our high-resolution VLA observations have revealed that the majority of the
sources in our sample (93 out of 155) are compact on angular scales
$<0.2^{\prime \prime}$ ($\leq 1.7$ kpc at $z \sim2$). The radio luminosities,
linear extents, and lobe pressures of our sources are similar to young radio
active galactic nuclei (AGN; e.g., Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum, GPS, and Compact
Steep Spectrum, CSS, sources), but their space density is considerably lower.
Application of a simple adiabatic lobe expansion model suggests relatively
young dynamical ages ($\sim10^{4-7}$ years), relatively high ambient ISM
densities ($\sim1-10^4$ cm$^{-3}$), and modest lobe expansion speeds
($\sim30-10,000$ km s$^{-1}$). Thus, we find our sources to be consistent with
a population of newly triggered, young jets caught in a unique evolutionary
stage in which they still reside within the dense gas reservoirs of their
hosts. Based on their radio luminosity function and dynamical ages, we estimate
only $\sim20\%$ of classical large scale FRI/II radio galaxies could have
evolved directly from these objects. We speculate that the WISE-NVSS sources
might first become GPS or CSS sources, of which some might ultimately evolve
into larger radio galaxies.

  QCD Scales","  High energy nuclear collisions manifest a variety of interesting phenomena
over a broad range of energy scales. Many of these phenomena are related to the
formation of a hot and dense state of deconfined quarks and gluons known as the
quark gluon plasma (QGP). Chief among these are the observed near inviscid
hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP, as measured through azimuthal anisotropy
coefficients of low-$p_\mathrm{T}$ final state hadrons $v_\mathrm{n}$, and the
loss of energy of high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ color charges as they traverse the QGP
which is observed as a quenching of strongly-interacting final state objects
like jets. Observations of these phenomena in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions at
RHIC and the LHC provide compelling evidence of QGP formation. Small collision
systems, like $p$+Pb, also show evidence for the creation droplets of QGP
through the observation of anisotropic flow; however, these systems show no
signs of the energy loss observed in large collision systems. Thus, small
systems are an ideal venue to explore the relationship between high- and
low-$p_\mathrm{T}$ QGP phenomena. Furthermore, the low ambient energy of $p$+Pb
compared to A+A collisions allow for the precise determination of perturbative
process rates which can be used to understand the nuclear modification of
nucleon parton densities.
  This dissertation explores $p$+Pb data collected with the ATLAS detector at
the LHC. The cross section and nuclear modification factor for prompt, isolated
photons are measured and compared to predictions from perturbative QCD
calculations and a model of initial state energy loss. Additionally, the
charged hadron azimuthal anisotropy coefficients, are measured via two-particle
correlations as a function of particle $p_\mathrm{T}$ and event centrality.
Results are shown from minimum bias events and events selected because of the
presence of a high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ jet.

technologies, including distributed generators (DGs) and remote-controlled
switches, although enhance the self-healing capability and allow faster
recovery, pose additional complexity to the service restoration problem,
especially under cold load pickup (CLPU) conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel two-stage restoration framework to generate restoration solutions with
a sequence of control actions. The first stage generates a restoration plan
that supports both the traditional service restoration using feeder
reconfiguration and the grid-forming DG-assisted intentional islanding methods.
The second stage generates an optimal sequence of switching operations to bring
the outaged system quickly to the final restored configuration. The problem is
formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates system
connectivity, operating constraints, and CLPU models. It is demonstrated using
a multi-feeder test case that the proposed framework is effective in utilizing
all available resources to quickly restore the service and generates an optimal
sequence of switching actions to be used by the operator to reach the desired
optimal configuration.

proposed to solve fat/water separation without the need for suitable
initialization. However, this approach requires supervised training of DNN

no-training of DNN (NTD) using physical cost and backpropagation to directly

  Results: All DNN methods generated consistent water/fat separation results
that agreed well with T2*-IDEAL under proper initialization.

platform for studying the relationship between nematicity, antiferromagnetism,
and superconductivity. Here, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and
resistivity measurements up to 4.73 GPa on FeSe$_{0.91}$S$_{0.09}$, we
established the pressure($p$)-temperature($T$) phase diagram in which the
nematic state is suppressed with pressure showing a nematic quantum phase
transition (QPT) around $p$ = 0.5 GPa, two SC regions, separated by the QPT,
appear and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase emerges above $\sim$3.3 GPa. From the
NMR results up to 2.1 GPa, AFM fluctuations are revealed to be characterized by
the stripe-type wavevector which remains the same for the two SC regions.
Furthermore, the electronic state is found to change in character from
non-Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid around the nematic QPT and persists up to
$\sim$ 2.1 GPa. In addition, although the AFM fluctuations correlate with
$T_{\rm c}$ in both SC states, demonstrating the importance of the AFM
fluctuations for the appearance of SC in the system, we found that, when
nematic order is absent, $T_{\rm c}$ is strongly correlated with the AFM
fluctuations, whereas $T_{\rm c}$ weakly depends on the AFM fluctuations when
nematic order is present. Our findings on FeSe$_{0.91}$S$_{0.09}$ were shown to
be applied to the whole FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ system and also provide a new
insight into the relationship between AFM fluctuations and SC in Fe-based
superconductors.

than a square root of the length has been a major challenge of the field. With
this challenge in mind, we investigate constructions that come from
high-dimensional expanders, in particular Ramanujan complexes. These naturally
give rise to very unbalanced quantum error correcting codes that have a large
$X$-distance but a much smaller $Z$-distance. However, together with a
classical expander LDPC code and a tensoring method that generalises a
construction of Hastings and also the Tillich-Zemor construction of quantum
codes, we obtain quantum LDPC codes whose minimum distance exceeds the square
root of the code length and whose dimension comes close to a square root of the
code length. When the ingredient is a 3-dimensional Ramanujan complex, we show
that its 2-systole behaves like a square of the log of the complex size, which
results in an overall quantum code of minimum distance $n^{1/2}\log n$, and
sets a new record for quantum LDPC codes. When we use a 2-dimensional Ramanujan
complex, or the 2-skeleton of a 3-dimensional Ramanujan complex, we obtain a
quantum LDPC code of minimum distance $n^{1/2}\log^{1/2}n$. We then exploit the
expansion properties of the complex to devise the first polynomial time
algorithm that decodes above the square root barrier for quantum LDPC codes.

over a broad range of energy, from radio up to hard X-rays. In particular, this
object is unique among soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and AXPs in presenting
simultaneously mid-infrared emission and pulsed optical emission. In spite of
the many propositions to explain this wide range of emission, it still lacks
one that reproduces all the observations. Filling this gap, we present a model
to reproduce the quiescent spectral energy distribution of 4U 0142+61 from
mid-infrared up to hard X-rays using plausible physical components and
parameters. We propose that the persistent emission comes from a magnetic
accreting white dwarf (WD) surrounded by a debris disk. This model assumes
that: (i) the hard X-rays are due to the bremsstrahlung emission from the
post-shock region of the accretion column; (ii) the soft X-rays are originated
by hot spots on the WD surface; and (iii) the optical and infrared emissions
are caused by an optically thick dusty disk, the WD photosphere, and the tail
of the postshock region emission. In this scenario, the fitted model parameters
indicate that 4U 0142+61 harbors a fast-rotator magnetic near-Chandrasekhar WD,
which is very hot and hence young. Such a WD can be the recent outcome of a
merger of two less massive WDs. In this case, 4U 0142+61 can evolve to an SN Ia
and hence can give hints of the origin of these important astrophysical events.
Additionally, we also present a new estimate of 4U 0142+61 distance, 3.78

textual features in sentences. A single space is not enough to accommodate
various videos and sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that
maps instances into multiple individual embedding spaces so that we can capture
multiple relationships between instances, leading to compelling video

similarities measured in each embedding space using a weighted sum strategy. We
determine the weights according to a sentence. Therefore, we can flexibly

Planned explosions of old ammunition in Finland generate transient infrasound
waves that travel through the atmosphere. These waves are partially reflected
back towards the ground from stratospheric levels, and are detected at a
receiver station located in northern Norway at 178 km almost due North from the
explosion site. The difference between the true horizontal direction towards
the source and the backazimuth direction (the horizontal direction of arrival)
of the incoming infrasound wave-fronts, in combination with the pulse
propagation time, are exploited to provide an estimate of the average
cross-wind component in the penetrated atmosphere. We perform offline
assimilation experiments with an ensemble Kalman filter and these observations,
using the ERA5 ensemble reanalysis atmospheric product as background (prior)
for the wind at different vertical levels. We demonstrate that information from
both sources can be combined to obtain analysis (posterior) estimates of
cross-winds at different vertical levels of the atmospheric slice between the
explosion site and the recording station. The assimilation makes greatest
impact at the 12-60 km levels, with some changes with respect to the prior of
the order of 0.1-1.0 m/s, which is a magnitude larger than the typical standard
deviation of the ERA5 background. The reduction of background variance in the
higher levels often reached 2-5%. This is the first published study
demonstrating techniques to implement assimilation of infrasound data into
atmospheric models. It paves the way for further exploration in the use of

transformation between point cloud pairs by iteratively performing data
association and motion estimation. Despite its success and popularity, ICP is
effectively a deterministic algorithm, and attempts to reformulate it in a
probabilistic manner generally do not capture all sources of uncertainty, such
as data association errors and sensor noise. This leads to overconfident
transformation estimates, potentially compromising the robustness of systems
relying on them. In this paper we propose a novel method to estimate pose
uncertainty in ICP with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Our method
combines recent developments in optimization for scalable Bayesian sampling
such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to infer a full posterior

our method, called Bayesian ICP, in experiments using 3D Kinect data
demonstrating that our method is capable of both quickly and accuractely

previous studies of the HNL phenomenology at SHiP. In particular, SHiP is
capable of fully exploring the central part of the kinematically allowed region

  breaking","  Diffusion of particles has wide repercussions ranging from particle-based
soft matter systems to solid state systems with particular electronic
properties. Recently, in the field of magnetism, diffusion of magnetic
skyrmions, topologically stabilized quasi-particles, has been demonstrated.
Here we show that by applying a magnetic in-plane field and therefore breaking
the symmetry of the system, the skyrmion diffusion becomes anisotropic with
faster diffusion parallel to the field axis and slower diffusion perpendicular
to it. We furthermore show that the absolute value of the applied field
controls the absolute values of the diffusion coefficients so that one can
thereby uniquely tune both the orientation of the diffusion and its strength.
Based on the stochastic Thiele equation, we can explain the observed
anisotropic diffusion as a result of the elliptical deformation of the
skyrmions by the application of the in-plane field.

the availability of reliable forecasts for the number of cases in the coming
days is of fundamental importance. We propose a simple statistical method for
short-term real-time forecasting of the number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities
in countries that are latecomers -- i.e., countries where cases of the disease
started to appear some time after others. In particular, we propose a penalized
(LASSO) regression with an error correction mechanism to construct a model of a
latecomer in terms of the other countries that were at a similar stage of the
pandemic some days before. By tracking the number of cases and deaths in those
countries, we forecast through an adaptive rolling-window scheme the number of
cases and deaths in the latecomer. We apply this methodology to Brazil, and
show that (so far) it has been performing very well. These forecasts aim to
foster a better short-run management of the health system capacity.

learning and scientific computing. They involve finding a certain kind of
spectral decomposition to obtain basis functions that can capture important
structures for the problem at hand. The most common spectral method is the
principal component analysis (PCA). It utilizes the top eigenvectors of the
data covariance matrix, e.g. to carry out dimensionality reduction. This data
pre-processing step is often effective in separating signal from noise. PCA and
other spectral techniques applied to matrices have several limitations. By
limiting to only pairwise moments, they are effectively making a Gaussian
approximation on the underlying data and fail on data with hidden variables
which lead to non-Gaussianity. However, in most data sets, there are latent
effects that cannot be directly observed, e.g., topics in a document corpus, or
underlying causes of a disease. By extending the spectral decomposition methods
to higher order moments, we demonstrate the ability to learn a wide range of
latent variable models efficiently. Higher-order moments can be represented by
tensors, and intuitively, they can encode more information than just pairwise
moment matrices. More crucially, tensor decomposition can pick up latent
effects that are missed by matrix methods, e.g. uniquely identify
non-orthogonal components. Exploiting these aspects turns out to be fruitful
for provable unsupervised learning of a wide range of latent variable models.
We also outline the computational techniques to design efficient tensor
decomposition methods. We introduce Tensorly, which has a simple python
interface for expressing tensor operations. It has a flexible back-end system
supporting NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow and MXNet amongst others, allowing
multi-GPU and CPU operations and seamless integration with deep-learning
functionalities.

relative order parameter of genomic transcriptions at single cell level during
the cell fate change process, which shows increasing during differentiation,
and decreasing upon reprogramming. Moreover, based on the scEntropy dynamics,
we construct a phenomenological stochastic differential equation model and the
corresponding Fokker-Plank equation for cell state transitions during iPSC
differentiation, which provide insights to infer cell fates changes and stem
cell differentiation. This study is the first to introduce the novel concept of
scEntropy to the biological process of iPSC, and suggests that the scEntropy
can provide a suitable quantify to describe cell fate transition in
differentiation and reprogramming of stem cells.

hairs, dubbed {\it hairons}, which dominate the Cosmological Entropy. We
elaborate on the Cosmological Constant (CC) problem, in both the dynamical and
time-constant possibilities. We show that all dangerous quantum mixings between
the CC and the Planck energy scales are exponentially suppressed as an entropic
collective effect of the hairon environment. As a consequence, the dark energy
scale is UV insensitive to any quantum gravity corrections. On the other hand,
the inflation scale is similarly stabilized from any radiative effects. In the
case of the Dark energy, we show the presence of a holographic entropic
attractor, favoring a time variation of $\Lambda\rightarrow 0$ in future rather
than a static CC case; i.e. $w>-1$ Dynamical DE is favored over a CC or a
$w<-1$ phantom cosmology. In both the inflation and dark energy sectors, we
elaborate on the Trans-Planckian problem, in relation with the recently
proposed Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC). We show that the
probability for any sub-planckian length modes to survive after inflation is
completely negligible as a holographic wash-out mechanism. This avoids the TCC

attracted a great of attention in recent years. In controlling these systems,
the trade-off between the global optimality and the scalability is a major
challenge. In the present paper, we focus on the mean field game (MFG) as a
possible control method for swarm robot systems. The MFG is a framework to
deduce a macroscopic model for describing robot density profiles from the
microscopic robot dynamics. For a coverage control problem aiming at uniformly
distributing robots over space, we extend the original MFG in order to present
two methods for optimally controlling swarm robots: the model predictive mean
field game (MP-MFG) and the best reply strategy (BRS). Importantly, the MP-MFG
converges to the BRS in the limit of prediction time going to zero, which is
also confirmed by our numerical experiments. In addition, we show numerically
that the optimal input is obtained in both the MP-MFG and the BRS, and widening
the prediction time of the MP-MFG improves the control performance.

performance in many medical applications such as lesion quantification, organ
detection, etc. However, most of the methods rely on supervised learning, which
require a large set of high-quality labeled data. Data annotation is generally
an extremely time-consuming process. To address this problem, we propose a
generic semi-supervised learning framework for image segmentation based on a
deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). An encoder-decoder based DCNN is
initially trained using a few annotated training samples. This initially
trained model is then copied into sub-models and improved iteratively using
random subsets of unlabeled data with pseudo labels generated from models
trained in the previous iteration. The number of sub-models is gradually
decreased to one in the final iteration. We evaluate the proposed method on a
public grand-challenge dataset for skin lesion segmentation. Our method is able
to significantly improve beyond fully supervised model learning by
incorporating unlabeled data.

spreading in a non-sedentary population, and it is a reaction-diffusion
process. In the diffusion stage, the individuals can jump between connected
nodes, according to different diffusive rates for the infected and susceptible
individuals. In the reaction stage, the contagion can happen if there is an
infected individual sharing the same node, and infected individuals can
spontaneously recover. Our main modification is to turn the number of
individuals' interactions independent on the population size by using Gillespie
algorithm with a reaction time $t_\mathrm{max}$, exponentially distributed with
mean inversely proportional to the node concentration. Our simulation results
of the modified model on Barabasi-Albert networks are compatible with a
continuous phase transition with a finite threshold from an absorbing phase to
an active phase when increasing the concentration. The transition obeys the
mean-field critical exponents of the order parameter, its fluctuations and the
spatial correlation length, whose values are $\beta=1$, $\gamma'=0$ and
$\nu_\perp=1/2$, respectively. In addition, the system presents logarithmic
corrections with pseudo-exponents $\widehat{\beta}=\widehat{\gamma}'=-3/2$ on

implication of our simulation results is if the individuals avoid social
interactions in order to not spread a disease, this leads the system to have a
finite threshold in scale-free graphs, allowing for epidemic control.

System level controllers could be an attractive approach for robust nonlinear

than Alhashim et al. on KITTI), while still achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art networks on the NYU-Depth V2 and KITTI datasets.
Furthermore, experiments on inference speed and energy efficiency on a Jetson

simulations, which is robust against one- and multi-dimensional shocks, and is
accurate for low Mach number flows and discontinuities. The scheme belongs to a
family of the advection upstream splitting method employed in computational
aerodynamics, and it splits the inviscid flux in MHD equations into advection,
pressure, and magnetic tension parts, and then individually evaluates mass,
pressure, and magnetic tension fluxes at the interface of a computational cell.
The mass flux is designed to avoid numerical shock instability in
multidimension, while preserving contact discontinuity. The pressure flux
possesses a proper scaling for low Mach number flows, allowing reliable
simulations of nearly incompressible flows. The magnetic tension flux is built
to be consistent with the HLLD approximate Riemann solver to preserve
rotational discontinuity. We demonstrate various benchmark tests to verify the
novel performance of the scheme. Our results indicate that the scheme must be a
promising tool to tackle astrophysical systems that include both low and high
Mach number flows, as well as magnetic field inhomogeneities.

recent or nearby inputs to modify processing of current input. For example, in
natural language, contextual processing is necessary to correctly interpret
negation (e.g. phrases such as ""not bad""). However, our ability to understand
how networks process context is limited. Here, we propose general methods for
reverse engineering recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to identify and elucidate
contextual processing. We apply these methods to understand RNNs trained on
sentiment classification. This analysis reveals inputs that induce contextual
effects, quantifies the strength and timescale of these effects, and identifies
sets of these inputs with similar properties. Additionally, we analyze
contextual effects related to differential processing of the beginning and end
of documents. Using the insights learned from the RNNs we improve baseline
Bag-of-Words models with simple extensions that incorporate contextual
modification, recovering greater than 90% of the RNN's performance increase
over the baseline. This work yields a new understanding of how RNNs process
contextual information, and provides tools that should provide similar insight
more broadly.

corrections as well as wide-angle, evolution, window and lightcone effects. Our
model includes all relativistic corrections up to third-order including
third-order bias expansion. We consider all terms which depend linearly on
$\mathcal{H}/k$ (weak field approximation). We also study the impact of 1-loop
corrections to the matter power spectrum for the gravitational redshift and
transverse Doppler effect. We found wide-angle and window function effects to
significantly contribute to the dipole signal. When accounting for all
contributions, our dipole model can accurately capture the gravitational
redshift and Doppler terms up to the smallest scales included in our comparison
($k=0.48\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), while our model for the transverse Doppler term is
less accurate. We find the Doppler term to be the dominant signal for this low

contributions to the power spectrum dipole. A conservative estimate suggests
that the DESI-BGS sample should be able to have a detection of at least
$4.4\sigma$, while more optimistic estimates find detections of up to
$10\sigma$. Detecting these effects in the galaxy distribution allows new tests
of gravity on the largest scales, providing an interesting additional science

construct powerful classifiers. In this paper, we consider mining of minimal
emerging patterns from high-dimensional data sets under a variety of

can contain negative items that designate the absence of an item. In such a
case, a database becomes highly dense, and it makes mining more challenging
since popular pattern mining techniques such as fp-tree and occurrence deliver
do not efficiently work. To cope with this difficulty, we present an efficient
algorithm for mining minimal emerging patterns by combining two techniques:
dynamic variable-ordering during pattern search for enhancing pruning effect,
and the use of a pointer-based dynamic data structure, called dancing links,
for efficiently maintaining occurrence lists. Experiments on benchmark data
sets showed that our algorithm achieves significant speed-ups over emerging

eigenfunction of the third component of the operator of angular momentum. This
condition, imposed on a non observable, is often used to derive that the
eigenvalues of angular momentum could be only integer. We reexamine the
arguments based on this requirement and alternate condition imposed by Pauli
and show that they do not follow from the first principles and therefore these
constraints can dropped. Consequently, we arrive to the same conclusion as in
[1]: there exist regular, normalizable eigenfunctions with the non-integer
eigenvalues thus a non-integer angular momentum is perfectly admissible from
the theoretical viewpoint. The issue of the nature of eigenvalues forming the
spectrum of the angular momentum remains open. What can be derived from the
first principles is that to a fixed value of the angular momentum L corresponds
a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues of the third component of the angular
momentum, m, defined by the relation |m|=L-k, k=0,1,...,[L], where [L] is an
integer part of L. As a mathematical byproduct of our analysis of
eigenfunctions, we present an alternate definition of a power of a complex

common characteristic of most of the tasks is that the texts are not restricted
to some rigid formats when generating. However, we may confront some special
text paradigms such as Lyrics (assume the music score is given), Sonnet, SongCi
(classical Chinese poetry of the Song dynasty), etc. The typical
characteristics of these texts are in three folds: (1) They must comply fully
with the rigid predefined formats. (2) They must obey some rhyming schemes. (3)
Although they are restricted to some formats, the sentence integrity must be
guaranteed. To the best of our knowledge, text generation based on the
predefined rigid formats has not been well investigated. Therefore, we propose
a simple and elegant framework named SongNet to tackle this problem. The
backbone of the framework is a Transformer-based auto-regressive language
model. Sets of symbols are tailor-designed to improve the modeling performance
especially on format, rhyme, and sentence integrity. We improve the attention
mechanism to impel the model to capture some future information on the format.

Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential to describe the inter-atomic interactions. The
effect of variation of temperatures (100 K-600 K), sizes, and crystal
orientation on the tensile response of the CdSe nanowires is investigated. Our
simulation results suggest that both ultimate tensile strength and Youngs
modulus of CdSe have an inverse relationship with temperature. From 100K to
600K, the ZB CdSe exhibits brittle type failure thus there is no brittle to
ductile transition temperature found. Results also suggest that size has a
significant effect on the mechanical properties of CdSe nanowire. It has been
found that as the cross-sectional area increases both ultimate tensile stress
and Youngs modulus increases as well. The [111] oriented ZB CdSe shows the
largest ultimate tensile strength, Youngs modulus and fracture toughness
whereas the values are lowest for [100] orientation. The [110] orientation
shows the largest failure strain compared to other orientations. Finally,
failure mechanisms of CdSe nanowire are also investigated at 100K and 600K. We
noticed that at 100K temperature [100] oriented ZB CdSe fails along {111}
cleavage plane however in the case of 600 K temperature, both {111} and {100}
planes are activated and cause fracture of CdSe nanowire at lower strain value.

promising routes to improving the brightness of electron sources. However, when
emittance growth occurs during beam transport (for example, due to
space-charge), it is possible that this emittance growth overwhelms the
contribution of the photocathode and, thus, in this case source emittance
improvements are not beneficial. Using multi-objective genetic optimization, we
investigate the role intrinsic emittance plays in determining the final
emittance of several space-charge dominated photoinjectors, including those for
high repetition rate free electron lasers and ultrafast electron diffraction.
We introduce a new metric to predict the scale of photocathode emittance
improvements that remain beneficial and explain how additional tuning is
required to take full advantage of new photocathode technologies. Additionally,
we determine the scale of emittance growth due to point-to-point Coulomb
interactions with a fast tree-based space-charge solver. Our results show that
in the realistic high brightness photoinjector applications under study, the
reduction of thermal emittance to values as low as 50 pm/um (1 meV MTE) remains
a viable option for the improvement of beam brightness.

for the use of maximal leakage to analyze such trade-offs. Maximal leakage is
an operationally interpretable leakage metric designed for side channels. We
present the most useful theoretical properties of maximal leakage from previous
work and demonstrate empirically that conventional metrics such as mutual

channels whereas maximal leakage does not. We also study the cost-leakage

  Traffic Forecasting","  Highway traffic modeling and forecasting approaches are critical for
intelligent transportation systems. Recently, deep-learning-based traffic
forecasting methods have emerged as state of the art for a wide range of
traffic forecasting tasks. However, these methods require a large amount of
training data, which needs to be collected over a significant period of time.
This can present a number of challenges for the development and deployment of
data-driven learning methods for highway networks that suffer from lack of
historical data. A promising approach to address this issue is transfer
learning, where a model trained on one part of the highway network can be
adapted for a different part of the highway network. We focus on diffusion
convolutional recurrent neural network (DCRNN), a state-of-the-art graph neural
network for highway network forecasting. It models the complex spatial and
temporal dynamics of the highway network using a graph-based diffusion
convolution operation within a recurrent neural network. DCRNN cannot perform
transfer learning, however, because it learns location-specific traffic
patterns, which cannot be used for unseen regions of the network. To that end,
we develop a new transfer learning approach for DCRNN, where a single model
trained on data-rich regions of the highway network can be used to forecast
traffic on unseen regions of the highway network. We evaluate the ability of
our approach to forecast the traffic on the entire California highway network
with one year of time series data. We show that TL-DCRNN can learn from several
regions of the California highway network and forecast the traffic on the
unseen regions of the network with high accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate that
TL-DCRNN can learn from San Francisco region traffic data and can forecast
traffic on the Los Angeles region and vice versa.

communication channel that does not support collision detection. A shared
communication channel is a multiple access channel, which consists of a
sequence of synchronized time slots. Players on the channel may attempt to
broadcast a packet (message) in any time slot. A player's broadcast succeeds if
no other player broadcasts during that slot. If two or more players broadcast
in the same time slot, then the broadcasts collide and both broadcasts fail.
The lack of collision detection means that a player monitoring the channel
cannot differentiate between the case of two or more players broadcasting in
the same slot (a collision) and zero players broadcasting. In the
contention-resolution problem, players arrive on the channel over time, and
each player has one packet to transmit. The goal is to coordinate the players
so that each player is able to successfully transmit its packet within
reasonable time. However, the players can only communicate via the shared
channel by choosing to either broadcast or not. A contention-resolution
protocol is measured in terms of its throughput (channel utilization). Previous
work on contention resolution that achieved constant throughput assumed that
either players could detect collisions, or the players' arrival pattern is
generated by a memoryless (non-adversarial) process.
  The foundational question answered by this paper is whether collision
detection is a luxury or necessity when the objective is to achieve constant
throughput. We show that even without collision detection, one can solve
contention resolution, achieving constant throughput, with high probability.

Here, by identifying the most important kind of critical fluctuations dubbed as

with those of lacking self-similarity in the phases fluctuations, we show that
self-similarity can indeed be broken with significant consequences at least in
nonequilibrium situations. We find that the breaking of self-similarity results
in new critical exponents which give rise to violation of the well-known

exponents in the ordered and the disordered phases of the paradigmatic Ising

observed through selfphase modulation (SPM). The GO films are integrated with
SOI nanowires using a large area, transfer free, layer by layer coating method
that yields precise control of the film thickness. The film placement and
coating length are controlled by opening windows in the silica cladding of the
SOI nanowires. Owing to the strong mode overlap between the SOI nanowires and
the highly nonlinear GO films, the Kerr nonlinearity of the hybrid waveguides
is significantly enhanced. Detailed SPM measurements using picosecond optical
pulses show significant spectral broadening enhancement for SOI nanowires
coated with 2.2 mm long films of 1 to 3 layers of GO, and 0.4 mm long films

dependence of the n2 for GO on layer number and pulse energy is obtained,
showing interesting physical insights and trends of the layered GO films from
2D monolayers to quasi bulk like behavior. Finally, we show that by coating SOI
nanowires with GO films the effective nonlinear parameter of SOI nanowires is
increased 16 times, with the effective nonlinear figure of merit (FOM)
increasing by about 20 times to greater than 5. These results reveal the strong

hybrid pulsations. Two components have similar atmospheric properties (T$_{\rm

order to determine the frequencies of the pulsations, to search for regular
spacing patterns in the Fourier spectrum, if any, and to discuss their origin
in the context of binarity and fast rotation. In this paper, we study the
properties of the stellar pulsations based on a careful analysis in the low-,
intermediate- and high-frequency regions of the Fourier spectrum. This is done
by performing repeated frequency-search analyses with successive prewhitenings
of all the significant frequencies detected in the spectrum. Moreover, we
searched for regular period spacings among the $g$ modes, as well as frequency
splitting among the $g$ and $p$ modes. In the low-frequency regime, five
regular period spacing patterns including one series of prograde $g$ modes and
four series of retrograde $r$ modes were detected. The $r$ modes are
well-distributed with respect to the harmonics of the rotational frequency of
the fast-rotating star $f_{\rm rot}$ = 1.647 d$^{-1}$. The dominant $g$ mode is
$f_{2}$ = 2.37 d$^{-1}$. The strongest p mode, at $f_{1}$ = 13.97 d$^{-1}$,
forms a singlet. In the high-frequency region, we identified two multiplets of
regularly split $p$ modes with mean frequency spacings of 0.42 d$^{-1}$ and
1.65 d$^{-1}$. We detected some series of retrograde $r$ and prograde $g$ modes
as well as two multiplets of $p$ modes with frequency spacings related to the
stellar rotation of both components of the twin system KIC~8975515. We
identified the fast-rotating component as a hybrid pulsator with $r$ modes and
the slowly-rotating component as a $\delta$ Sct pulsator.

  disc of a simulated Milky Way analogous galaxy","  In order to understand the roles of metal flows in galaxy formation and
evolution, we analyse our self-consistent cosmological chemo-dynamical
simulation of a Milky Way like galaxy during its thin-disc phase. Our simulated
galaxy disc qualitatively reproduces the variation of the dichotomy in
[$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] at different Galactocentric distances as derived by
APOGEE-DR16, as well as the stellar age distribution in [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]
from APOKASC-2. The disc grows from the inside out, with a radial gradient in
the star-formation rate during the entire phase. Despite the radial dependence,
the outflow-to-infall ratio of metals in our simulated halo shows a universal
(time-independent) profile scaling with the disc growth. The simulated disc
undergoes two modes of gas inflow: (i) an infall of metal-poor and relatively
low-[$\alpha$/Fe] gas, and (ii) a radial flow where already chemically-enriched
gas moves inwards with an average velocity of $\sim0.7$ km/s. Moreover, we find
that stellar migrations mostly happen outwards, on typical time scales of
$\sim5$ Gyr. Our predicted radial metallicity gradients agree with the
observations from APOGEE-DR16, and the main effect of stellar migrations is to
flatten the radial metallicity profiles by 0.05 dex/kpc in the slopes. We also
show that the effect of migrations can appear more important in [$\alpha$/Fe]
than in the [Fe/H]-age relation of thin-disc stars.

confirmed that this virus has taken over 126,607 lives until today. Since the
beginning of its spreading, many Artificial Intelligence researchers developed
systems and methods for predicting the virus's behavior or detecting the
infection. One of the possible ways of determining the patient infection to
COVID-19 is through analyzing the chest X-ray images. As there are a large
number of patients in hospitals, it would be time-consuming and difficult to
examine lots of X-ray images, so it can be very useful to develop an AI network
that does this job automatically. In this paper, we have trained several deep
convolutional networks with the introduced training techniques for classifying
X-ray images into three classes: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19, based on two
open-source datasets. Unfortunately, most of the previous works on this subject
have not shared their dataset, and we had to deal with few data on covid19
cases. Our data contains 180 X-ray images that belong to persons infected to
COVID-19, so we tried to apply methods to achieve the best possible results. In
this research, we introduce some training techniques that help the network
learn better when we have few cases of COVID-19, and also we propose a neural
network that is a concatenation of Xception and ResNet50V2 networks. This
network achieved the best accuracy by utilizing multiple features extracted by
two robust networks. In this paper, despite some other researches, we have
tested our network on 11302 images to report the actual accuracy our network
can achieve in real circumstances. The average accuracy of the proposed network
for detecting COVID-19 cases is 99.56%, and the overall average accuracy for

for unlabeled data to retrain the model. However, directly using noisy
pseudo-labels will cause error amplification and accumulation. Considering the
topology structure of human body, we propose a trainable graph reasoning method
that establishes internal structural connections between graph nodes to correct
two typical errors in the pseudo-labels, i.e., the global structural error and
the local consistency error. For the global error, we first transform
category-wise features into a high-level graph model with coarse-grained
structural information, and then decouple the high-level graph to reconstruct
the category features. The reconstructed features have a stronger ability to
represent the topology structure of the human body. Enlarging the receptive
field of features can effectively reducing the local error. We first project
feature pixels into a local graph model to capture pixel-wise relations in a
hierarchical graph manner, then reverse the relation information back to the
pixels. With the global structural and local consistency modules, these errors
are rectified and confident pseudo-labels are generated for retraining.
Extensive experiments on the LIP and the ATR datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our global and local rectification modules. Our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in supervised human parsing tasks.

usually fail to generalize well to another. Domain adaptation is one of the
potential solutions to address the problem. However, few of existing works
focused on the translation of video-based data. In this work, we propose a
novel generative adversarial network (GAN), namely VideoGAN, to transfer the
video-based data across different domains. As the frames of a video may have
similar content and imaging conditions, the proposed VideoGAN has an X-shape
generator to preserve the intra-video consistency during translation.
Furthermore, a loss function, namely color histogram loss, is proposed to tune
the color distribution of each translated frame. Two colonoscopic datasets from
different centres, i.e., CVC-Clinic and ETIS-Larib, are adopted to evaluate the
performance of domain adaptation of our VideoGAN. Experimental results
demonstrate that the adapted colonoscopic video generated by our VideoGAN can
significantly boost the segmentation accuracy, i.e., an improvement of 5%, of
colorectal polyps on multicentre datasets. As our VideoGAN is a general network
architecture, we also evaluate its performance with the CamVid driving video
dataset on the cloudy-to-sunny translation task. Comprehensive experiments show
that the domain gap could be substantially narrowed down by our VideoGAN.

resonator is designed to operate in S-band. It has a short circuit
configuration which leads to miniaturization. It is so constructed such that it
has a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. Detailed electromagnetic simulation
with a particular emphasis on the excitation of the structure has been
performed for this resonator owing to its uniplanar nature. The design
parameters and the electromagnetic field distribution are obtained from the
simulation. The resonator is fabricated using optical lithography with a rapid
prototyping technique. The characteristic response of the resonator is measured
by coupling it to a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The ESR absorption spectrum
of free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) is captured by using this
resonator in reflection geometry. The microwave magnetic field distribution at
the sample position is investigated.The measured g-factor value is found to be
consistent with that reported in the literature. The quality factor of this
resonator is found to be low and this makes it suitable for use in a Pulsed ESR
spectrometer.

employing an adaptive importance sampling technique, we greatly improve the

parallelizable and can be up to orders of magnitude faster than MCMC, while
flexibly accommodating both algorithmic enhancements (including improved

demonstrate the performance of the presented approach on two well-known network

which addresses this problem, has been studied for approximately a decade.
However, conventional open set recognition methods based on deep neural

paper, we propose a DNN structure in which multiple one-vs-rest sigmoid
networks follow a convolutional neural network feature extractor. A one-vs-rest

the hidden layers and a single sigmoid target class output node, can maximize
the ability to learn information from nonmatch examples. Furthermore, the
network yields a sophisticated nonlinear features-to-output mapping that is
explainable in the feature space. By introducing extreme value theory-based
calibration techniques, the nonlinear and explainable mapping provides a
well-grounded class membership probability models. Our experiments show that
one-vs-rest networks can provide more informative hidden representations for
unknown examples than the commonly used SoftMax layer. In addition, the

on lens antenna arrays are capable of achieving a high antenna-gain at a
considerably reduced number of radio frequency (RF) chains via beam selection.
However, the traditional beam selection network suffers from significant
performance loss in wideband systems due to the effect of beam squint. In this
paper, we propose a phase shifter-aided beam selection network, which enables a
single RF chain to support multiple focused-energy beams, for mitigating the
beam squint in wideband mmWave MIMO systems. Based on this architecture, we
additionally design an efficient transmit precoder (TPC) for maximizing the
achievable sum-rate, which is composed of beam selection and beamspace
precoding. Specifically, we decouple the design problems of beamspace precoding
and beam selection by exploiting the fact that the beam selection matrix has a
limited number of candidates. For the beamspace precoding design, we propose a
successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based method, which decomposes the
associated optimization problem into a series of subproblems and solves them
successively. For the beam selection design, we propose an energy-max beam
selection method for avoiding the high complexity of exhaustive search, and
derive the number of required beams for striking an attractive trade-off
between the hardware cost and system performance. Our simulation results show
that the proposed beamspace precoding and beam selection methods achieve both a
higher sum-rate and a higher energy efficiency than its conventional

to multi-MEC-s in heterogeneous MEC systems with energy harvesting is
investigated from a game theoretic perspective. The objective is to minimize
the average response time of an MD that consists of communication time, waiting
time and processing time. M/G/1 queueing models are established for MDs and
MEC-ss. The interference among MDs, the randomness in computation task
generation, harvested energy arrival, wireless channel state, queueing at the
MEC-s, and the power budget constraint of an MD are taken into consideration. A
noncooperative computation offloading game is formulated. We give the
definition and existence analysis of the Nash equilibrium (NE). Furthermore, we
reconstruct the optimization problem of an MD. A 2-step decomposition is
presented and performed. Thereby, we arrive at a one-dimensional search problem

techniques. The softmax cross-entropy loss function is often used for
classification tasks. There are some works to introduce the additional terms in
the objective function for training to make the features of the output layer
more discriminative. The neuron-wise discriminant criterion makes the input
feature of each neuron in the output layer discriminative by introducing the
discriminant criterion to each of the features. Similarly, the center loss was
introduced to the features before the softmax activation function for face
recognition to make the deep features discriminative. The ReLU function is
often used for the network as an active function in the hidden layers of the
CNN. However, it is observed that the deep features trained by using the ReLU

exception to Krishna (2019). This can primarily be attributed to the lack of
availability of task-specific labelled data and the morphologically rich nature
of the language. In this work, we evaluate four different data-driven machine
learning models, originally proposed for different languages, and compare their
performances on Sanskrit data. We experiment with 2 graph based and 2
transition based parsers. We compare the performance of each of the models in a
low-resource setting, with 1,500 sentences for training. Further, since our
focus is on the learning power of each of the models, we do not incorporate any
Sanskrit specific features explicitly into the models, and rather use the
default settings in each of the paper for obtaining the feature functions. In
this work, we analyse the performance of the parsers using both an in-domain
and an out-of-domain test dataset. We also investigate the impact of word
ordering in which the sentences are provided as input to these systems, by
parsing verses and their corresponding prose order (anvaya) sentences.

memristor is generally a two-terminal electronic element with conductance that
varies nonlinearly with external electric stimuli and can be remembered when
the electric power is turned off. As an alternative, light can be used to tune
the memconductance and endow a memristor with a combination of the advantages
of both photonics and electronics. Both increases and decreases in optically
induced memconductance have been realized in different memristors; however, the
reversible tuning of memconductance with light in the same device remains a
considerable challenge that severely restricts the development of
optoelectronic memristors. Here we describe an all-optically controlled (AOC)

continuous range by varying only the wavelength of the controlling light. Our
memristor is based on the relatively mature semiconductor material InGaZnO

location of a single vehicle through multi-path signals, but also capitalizes
on the multi-vehicle aspects of road traffic to further improve

and recognition in natural images. In comparison to reading text in scanned
documents, the targeted problem is significantly more challenging. The use case
in focus facilitates the possibility to detect the text area in natural scenes
with greater accuracy because of the availability of images under constraints.
This is achieved using a camera mounted on a truck capturing likewise images
round-the-clock. The detected text area is then recognized using Tesseract OCR
engine. Even though it benefits low computational power requirements, the model
is limited to only specific use cases. This paper discusses a critical false
positive case scenario occurred while testing and elaborates the strategy used
to alleviate the problem. The project achieved a correct character recognition
rate of more than 80\%. This paper outlines the stages of development, the
major challenges and some of the interesting findings of the project.

from a subsidiary magnetic field or electric current could help reduce the
power consumption in spintronic devices. When increasing temperature above room
temperature, FeRh displays an uncommon antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase
transition linked to a unit cell volume expansion. Thus, using the strain
exerted by an adjacent piezoelectric layer, the relative amount of
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic regions can be tuned by an electric field
applied to the piezoelectric material. Indeed, large variations in the
saturation magnetization have been observed when straining FeRh films grown on
suitable piezoelectric substrates. In view of its applications, the variations
in the remanent magnetization rather than those of the saturation magnetization
are the most relevant. Here, we show that in the absence of any bias external
magnetic field, permanent and reversible magnetization changes as high as 34%
can be induced by an electric field, which remain after this has been zeroed.
Bulk and local magnetoelectric characterization reveals that the fundamental
reason for the large magnetoelectric response observed at remanence is the
expansion (rather than the nucleation) of ferromagnetic nanoregions.

the choice of (1) different bibliographic fields and (2) different approaches

two baselines: one based on the Medical Subject Headings in MEDLINE and another
based on the Science-Metrix journal classification. We tested to what extent
different approaches yield the desired labels for the classes in the two

across multiple orders of magnitude. We present a full-wave optical method to
highly efficiently compute the scattering of light at objects that are arranged
in bi-periodic arrays. Multiple arrays or homogeneous thin-films can be stacked
to build up an entire multicomposite material in the third dimension. The
scattering properties of the individual objects in each array are described by
the T-matrix formalism. Therefore, arbitrarily shaped objects and even
molecules can be the basic constituent of the arrays. Taking the T-matrix of
the individual scatterer as the point of departure allows to explain the
optical properties of the bulk material from the scattering properties of its
constituents. Unique to our approach is the solution to Maxwell's equations in
a basis set with well defined helicity. Therefore, chiral media are
particularly easy to consider as materials for both scatterers or embedding
media. We exemplify the efficiency of the algorithm with an exhaustive
parametric study of anti-reflective coatings for solar cells made from

encounters a huge amount of related information. Recommender systems are the
techniques for massively filtering information and offering the items that
users find them satisfying and interesting. The advances in machine learning
methods, especially deep learning, have led to great achievements in
recommender systems, although these systems still suffer from challenges such
as cold-start and sparsity problems. To solve these problems, context
information such as user communication network is usually used. In this paper,
we have proposed a novel recommendation method based on Matrix Factorization
and graph analysis methods, namely Louvain for community detection and HITS for
finding the most important node within the trust network. In addition, we
leverage deep Autoencoders to initialize users and items latent factors, and
the Node2vec deep embedding method gathers users' latent factors from the user
trust graph. The proposed method is implemented on Ciao and Epinions standard
datasets. The experimental results and comparisons demonstrate that the
proposed approach is superior to the existing state-of-the-art recommendation
methods. Our approach outperforms other comparative methods and achieves great
improvements, i.e., 15.56% RMSE improvement for Epinions and 18.41% RMSE
improvement for Ciao.

  ensembles","  Ensemble-based methods are highly popular approaches that increase the
accuracy of a decision by aggregating the opinions of individual voters. The
common point is to maximize accuracy; however, a natural limitation occurs if
incremental costs are also assigned to the individual voters. Consequently, we
investigate creating ensembles under an additional constraint on the total cost
of the members. This task can be formulated as a knapsack problem, where the
energy is the ensemble accuracy formed by some aggregation rules. However, the
generally applied aggregation rules lead to a nonseparable energy function,
which takes the common solution tools -- such as dynamic programming -- out of
action. We introduce a novel stochastic approach that considers the energy as
the joint probability function of the member accuracies. This type of knowledge
can be efficiently incorporated in a stochastic search process as a stopping
rule, since we have the information on the expected accuracy or, alternatively,
the probability of finding more accurate ensembles. Experimental analyses of
the created ensembles of pattern classifiers and object detectors confirm the
efficiency of our approach. Moreover, we propose a novel stochastic search
strategy that better fits the energy, compared with general approaches such as
simulated annealing.

the true underlying graph is decomposable. A hierarchical $G$-Wishart prior is
proposed to conduct a Bayesian inference for the precision matrix and its graph
structure. Although the posterior asymptotics using the $G$-Wishart prior has
received increasing attention in recent years, most of results assume moderate
high-dimensional settings, where the number of variables $p$ is smaller than
the sample size $n$. However, this assumption might not hold in many real
applications such as genomics, speech recognition and climatology. Motivated by
this gap, we investigate asymptotic properties of posteriors under the
high-dimensional setting where $p$ can be much larger than $n$. The pairwise
Bayes factor consistency, posterior ratio consistency and graph selection
consistency are obtained in this high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, the
posterior convergence rate for precision matrices under the matrix
$\ell_1$-norm is derived, which turns out to coincide with the minimax
convergence rate for sparse precision matrices. A simulation study confirms
that the proposed Bayesian procedure outperforms competitors.

approaches that have successfully addressed the problem, there has been a
notable dip in the performance of these existing detectors on ECG episodes that
contain noise and HRV Irregulates. On the other hand, Deep Learning(DL) based
methods have shown to be adept at modelling data that contain noise. In image
to image translation, Unet is the fundamental block in many of the networks. In
this work, a novel application of the Unet combined with Inception and Residual
blocks is proposed to perform the extraction of R-peaks from an ECG.
Furthermore, the problem formulation also robustly deals with issues of
variability and sparsity of ECG R-peaks. The proposed network was trained on a
database containing ECG episodes that have CVD and was tested against three
traditional ECG detectors on a validation set. The model achieved an F1 score
of 0.9837, which is a substantial improvement over the other beat detectors.
Furthermore, the model was also evaluated on three other databases. The

its generalizing capacity. Additionally, a thorough analysis of the model's

circular dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy and investigated cation valence states
and spin and orbital magnetic moments in the inverse-spinel ferrimagnet
Ni$_{1-x}$Co$_{2+y}$O$_{4-z}$ (NCO) epitaxial films with the perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy. We show that the oxygen pressure P$_{O2}$ during the film
growth by pulsed laser deposition influences not only the cation stoichiometry
(site-occupation) but also the cation valence state. Our XAS results show that
the Ni in the O$_{h}$-site is in the intermediate valence state between +2 and
+3, Ni$^{(2+\delta)+}$ (0<$\delta$<1), whose nominal valence state (the
$\delta$ value) varies depending on P$_{O2}$. On the other hand, the Co in the
octahedral (O$_{h}$) and tetrahedral (T$_{d}$) sites respectively have the
valence state close to +3 and +2. We also find that the XMCD signals originate
mainly from the T$_{d}$-site Co$^{2+}$ (Co$_{Td}$) and O$_{h}$-site
Ni$^{(2+\delta)+}$ (Ni$_{Oh}$), indicating that these cation valence states are
the key in determining the magnetic and transport properties of NCO films.
Interestingly, the valence state of Ni$^{(2+\delta)+}$ that gives rise to the
XMCD signal remains unchanged independent of P$_{O2}$. The electronic structure
of Ni$^{(2+\delta)+}$ that is responsible for the magnetic moment and
electrical conduction differs from those of Ni$^{2+}$ and Ni$^{3+}$. In
addition, the orbital magnetic moment originating from Co$_{Td}$ is as large as
0.14 $\mu_{B}/Co_{Td}$ and parallel to the magnetization while the Ni$_{Oh}$
orbital moment is as small as 0.07 $\mu_{B}/Ni_{Oh}$ and is rather isotropic.
The Co$_{Td}$ therefore plays the key role in the perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy of the films. Our results demonstrate the significance of the
site-dependent cations valence states for the magnetic and transport properties
of NCO films.

performance. New applications such as on-line games, virtual reality or high
quality video contents will further demand higher throughput levels, as well as
low latency. Beyond physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC)
improvements, deploying multiple access points (APs) in a given area may
significantly contribute to achieve those performance goals by simply improving
average coverage and data rates. However, it opens a new challenge: to
determine the best AP for each given station (STA).
  This article studies the achievable performance gains of using secondary APs,
also called Extenders, in Home WiFi networks in terms of throughput and delay.
To do that, we introduce a centralized, easily implementable channel load aware
selection mechanism for WiFi networks that takes full advantage of IEEE
802.11k/v capabilities to collect data from STAs, and distribute association
decisions accordingly. These decisions are completely computed in the AP (or,
alternatively, in an external network controller) based on an AP selection
decision metric that, in addition to RSSI, also takes into account the load of
both access and backhaul wireless links for each potential STA-AP/Extender
connection.
  Performance evaluation of the proposed channel load aware AP and Extender
selection mechanism has been first conducted in a purpose-built simulator,
resulting in an overall improvement of the main analyzed metrics (throughput,
delay, and fraction of scenarios that are kept uncongested) when compared to
the traditional RSSI-based WiFi association. This trend was confirmed when the
channel load aware mechanism was tested in a real deployment, and STAs were
associated to the indicated AP/Extender.

computationally intensive operation, we introduce group convolution to decrease
calculation cost and parameter size further. Thus, the number of parameters and
the consumptions of calculation are observably less than contrapositive deep
learning methods, which means LiteDenseNet owns simpler architecture and higher
efficiency. A series of quantitative experiences on 6 widely used hyperspectral

Then, motivated by the cluster assumption that examples in the same cluster

have been proposed. However, the calculation cost becomes enormous as the size
of the models becomes larger. Various techniques for compressing the size of
the models have been proposed to improve performance while reducing
computational costs. One of the methods to compress the size of the models is
knowledge distillation (KD). Knowledge distillation is a technique for
transferring knowledge of deep or ensemble models with many parameters (teacher
model) to smaller shallow models (student model). Since the purpose of
knowledge distillation is to increase the similarity between the teacher model
and the student model, we propose to introduce the concept of metric learning
into knowledge distillation to make the student model closer to the teacher
model using pairs or triplets of the training samples. In metric learning, the
researchers are developing the methods to build a model that can increase the
similarity of outputs for similar samples. Metric learning aims at reducing the
distance between similar and increasing the distance between dissimilar. The
functionality of the metric learning to reduce the differences between similar
outputs can be used for the knowledge distillation to reduce the differences
between the outputs of the teacher model and the student model. Since the
outputs of the teacher model for different objects are usually different, the
student model needs to distinguish them. We think that metric learning can
clarify the difference between the different outputs, and the performance of
the student model could be improved. We have performed experiments to compare
the proposed method with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods.

investigate joining these tasks at the architectural level. We propose a
registration network that integrates segmentation propagation between images,
and a segmentation network to predict the segmentation directly. These networks
are connected into a single joint architecture via so-called cross-stitch
units, allowing information to be exchanged between the tasks in a learnable
manner. The proposed method is evaluated in the context of adaptive
image-guided radiotherapy, using daily prostate CT imaging. Two datasets from
different institutes and manufacturers were involved in the study. The first
dataset was used for training (12 patients) and validation (6 patients), while
the second dataset was used as an independent test set (14 patients). In terms
of mean surface distance, our approach achieved $1.06 \pm 0.3$ mm, $0.91 \pm
0.4$ mm, $1.27 \pm 0.4$ mm, and $1.76 \pm 0.8$ mm on the validation set and

demonstrating the capability to leverage the individual strengths of the

actively discourages exploratory behaviour, thus demonstrating that exploration
does not directly follow from free energy minimization into the future. We then
develop a novel objective, the Free-Energy of the Expected Future (FEEF), which
possesses both the epistemic component of the EFE as well as an intuitive
mathematical grounding as the divergence between predicted and desired futures.

energy to deliver large scale computational services. Computing nodes generate
large volumes of heat, requiring cooling units in turn to eliminate the effect
of this heat. Thus, the overall energy consumption of the CDC increases
tremendously for servers as well as for cooling units. However, current
workload allocation policies do not take into account the effect on temperature
and it is challenging to simulate the thermal behavior of CDCs. There is a need
for a thermal-aware framework to simulate and model the behavior of nodes and
measure the important performance parameters which can be affected by its
temperature. In this paper, we propose a lightweight framework, ThermoSim, for
modeling and simulation of thermal-aware resource management for cloud
computing environments. This work presents a Recurrent Neural Network based
deep learning temperature predictor for CDCs which is utilized by ThermoSim for
lightweight resource management in constrained cloud environments. ThermoSim
extends the CloudSim toolkit helping to analyze the performance of various key
parameters such as energy consumption, SLA violation rate, number of VM
migrations and temperature during the management of cloud resources for
execution of workloads. Further, different energy-aware and thermal-aware
resource management techniques are tested using the proposed ThermoSim
framework in order to validate it against the existing framework. The
experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework is capable of modeling

better than Thas in terms of energy consumption, cost, time, memory usage &
prediction accuracy.

lattice QCD simulations at unphysical masses of $m_\pi=410-570$ MeV to the
physical point using chiral effective field theory as guideline. In addition,
we consider phenomenological $Y_c N$ models from the literature to explore the
sensitivity of the results to the properties of the interaction in detail. We
find that a measurement of the $\Lambda_c p$ correlation functions could indeed
allow one to discriminate between strongly attractive $\Lambda_c N$ forces, as
predicted by some phenomenological models, and a weakly attractive interaction
as suggested by the presently available lattice simulations.

parameters of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Each of the fixed cameras
has a Field of View of 53 x 74 degrees, while the five cameras combined cover
the entire sky down to 20 degrees from the horizon. Each of the cameras takes
an image every 6.4 seconds, after which the images are automatically processed
and stored. We have developed an automated data reduction pipeline that
recognizes satellite tracks, to pixel level accuracy ($\sim$ 0.02 degrees), and
uses their endpoints to determine the orbital elements in the form of
standardized Two Line Elements (TLEs). The routines, that use existing
algorithms such as the Hough transform and the Ransac method, can be used on
any optical dataset.
  For a satellite with an unknown TLE, we need at least two overflights to
accurately predict the next one. Known TLEs can be refined with every pass to
improve collision detections or orbital decay predictions, for example. For our
current data analysis we have been focusing on satellites in LEO, where we are
able to recover between 50% and 80% of the known overpasses during twilight. We
have been able to detect LEO satellites down to 7th visual magnitude. Higher
objects, up to geosynchronous orbit, were visually observed, but are currently
not being automatically picked up by our reduction pipeline. We expect that
with further improvements to our data reduction, and potentially with longer
integration times and/or different optics, the instrumental set-up can be used
for tracking a significant fraction of satellites up to geosynchronous orbit.

(SMT) that increases computer resource utilization by sharing them across
several threads, we propose non-blocking SMT (NB-SMT) designated for DNN
accelerators. Like conventional SMT, NB-SMT shares hardware resources among
several execution flows. Yet, unlike SMT, NB-SMT is non-blocking, as it handles
structural hazards by exploiting the algorithmic resiliency of DNNs. Instead of
opportunistically dispatching instructions while they wait in a reservation
station for available hardware, NB-SMT temporarily reduces the computation
precision to accommodate all threads at once, enabling a non-blocking
operation. We demonstrate NB-SMT applicability using SySMT, an NB-SMT-enabled
output-stationary systolic array (OS-SA). Compared with a conventional OS-SA, a
2-threaded SySMT consumes 1.4x the area and delivers 2x speedup with 33% energy

computationally expensive N-body simulations, which can create a computational
bottleneck for data analysis. Simulation-based emulators of observables are
starting to play an increasingly important role in cosmology, as the analytical
predictions are expected to reach their precision limits for upcoming
experiments. Modern deep generative models, such as Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), have demonstrated their potential to significantly reduce the
computational cost of generating such simulations and generate the observable

fixed value of the cosmological parameters, which limits their practical
applicability. We instead propose a new conditional model that is able to
generate simulations for arbitrary cosmological parameters spanned by the space
of simulations. Our results show that unseen cosmologies can be generated with
high statistical accuracy and visual quality. This contribution is a step

we propose a novel approach towards ground-terrain recognition via modeling the
Extent-of-Texture information to establish a balance between the order-less
texture component and ordered-spatial information locally. At first, the
proposed method uses a CNN backbone feature extractor network to capture
meaningful information of a ground terrain image, and model the extent of
texture and shape information locally. Then, the order-less texture information
and ordered shape information are encoded in a patch-wise manner, which is
utilized by intra-domain message passing module to make every patch aware of
each other for rich feature learning. Next, the Extent-of-Texture (EoT) Guided
Inter-domain Message Passing module combines the extent of texture and shape
information with the encoded texture and shape information in a patch-wise
fashion for sharing knowledge to balance out the order-less texture information
with ordered shape information. Further, Bilinear model generates a pairwise
correlation between the order-less texture information and ordered shape
information. Finally, the ground-terrain image classification is performed by a
fully connected layer. The experimental results indicate superior performance
of the proposed model over existing state-of-the-art techniques on publicly
available datasets like DTD, MINC and GTOS-mobile.

star before it merges with the black hole, in a manner analogous to the growth
of the event horizon in stellar collapse. We may say that, ahead of its fall

itself. We discuss how the phenomenon, even if not directly observable, can be
invariantly characterized. We demonstrate it quantitatively by explicitly
constructing the merger event horizon in the extreme-mass-ratio limit. We show
that the effect is present for realistic neutron star models and admissible

all-to-all propagators. In this paper we present a Davidson-type eigensolver
that utilizes the structural properties of the Hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator
$Q$ to compute eigenpairs of this operator corresponding to small eigenvalues.
The main idea is to exploit a synergy between the (outer) eigensolver and its
(inner) iterative scheme which solves shifted linear systems. This is achieved
by adapting the multigrid DD-$\alpha$AMG algorithm to a solver for shifted
systems involving the Hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator. We demonstrate that
updating the coarse grid operator using eigenvector information obtained in the
course of the generalized Davidson method is crucial to achieve good
performance when calculating many eigenpairs, as our study of the local
coherence shows. We compare our method with the commonly used software-packages
PARPACK and PRIMME in numerical tests, where we are able to achieve significant
improvements, with speed-ups of up to one order of magnitude and a near-linear
scaling with respect to the number of eigenvalues. For illustration we compare
the distribution of the small eigenvalues of $Q$ on a $64\times 32^3$ lattice

experiments on single layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy measure a charge
density wave transition temperature in the monolayer similar to the bulk,
around 33 K, Raman experiments on exfoliated samples observe a large
enhancement of the transition temperature up to 145 K. By calculating from
first principles the charge density wave temperature, we determine that the
intrinsic charge density wave is barely affected by dimensionality as suggested
by the scanning tunnelling experiments. The transition temperature is estimated
by calculating the temperature dependence of the phonon spectra within a
non-perturbative approach to deal with anharmonicity and determining at which
temperature the phonon energy of the mode driving the instability vanishes. The
obtained transition temperature in the bulk is around 59 K, in rather good
agreement with experiments, and it is just slightly increased in the
single-layer limit to 73 K, showing the weak dependence of the transition on
dimensionality. Our results demonstrate that the charge density wave melts due

that environmental factors, such as sample preparation or the substrate, have a
large impact on the transition temperatures.

flexibility and simplicity of fabrication in producing optical devices. This
study reveals that the optical reflectance of defective APCs is strongly

structure works as a perfect reflector for the considerable range of wavelength
for higher azimuthal mode numbers. Lastly, our results show that by increase
the temperature of superconductor layer both of the existed band gaps and

understanding. Besides 2D information such as human/object appearance and
locations, 3D pose is also usually utilized in HOI learning since its
view-independence. However, rough 3D body joints just carry sparse body
information and are not sufficient to understand complex interactions. Thus, we
need detailed 3D body shape to go further. Meanwhile, the interacted object in
3D is also not fully studied in HOI learning. In light of these, we propose a
detailed 2D-3D joint representation learning method. First, we utilize the
single-view human body capture method to obtain detailed 3D body, face and hand
shapes. Next, we estimate the 3D object location and size with reference to the
2D human-object spatial configuration and object category priors. Finally, a
joint learning framework and cross-modal consistency tasks are proposed to
learn the joint HOI representation. To better evaluate the 2D ambiguity
processing capacity of models, we propose a new benchmark named Ambiguous-HOI
consisting of hard ambiguous images. Extensive experiments in large-scale HOI
benchmark and Ambiguous-HOI show impressive effectiveness of our method. Code

non-Markovian anti-Zeno dynamics, and corresponding reduction in the
thermalization times. Faster thermalization can in turn significantly enhance
the power output in engines, or equivalently, the rate of refrigeration in
refrigerators. This improvement in performance of dynamically controlled Otto
thermal machines arises due to the time-energy uncertainty relation of quantum

absorption or scattering. The extinction cross section is usually treated as an

attenuation of light. In this work, we demonstrate that the extinction cross
section of a large gold nanoparticle can be substantially reduced, i.e., the
particle becomes more transparent, if a single molecule is placed in its near
field. This partial cloaking effect results from a coherent plasmonic
interaction between the molecule and the nanoparticle, whereby each of them
acts as a nano-antenna to modify the radiative properties of the other.

  Bose-Einstein condensates and breathing dynamics","  We unravel the correlation effects of the second-order quantum phase
transitions emerging on the ground state of a harmonically trapped spin-1 Bose
gas, upon varying the involved Zeeman terms, as well as its breathing dynamics
triggered by quenching the trapping frequency. It is found that the boundaries
of the associated magnetic phases are altered in the presence of interparticle
correlations for both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin-spin
interactions, an effect which becomes more prominent in the few-body scenario.
Most importantly, we unveil a correlation-induced shrinking of the
anti-ferromagnetic and broken-axisymmetry phases implying that ground states
with bosons polarized in a single spin-component are favored. Turning to the
dynamical response of the spinor gas it is shown that its breathing frequency
is independent of the system parameters while correlations lead to the
formation of filamentary patterns in the one-body density of the participating
components. The number of filaments is larger for increasing spin-independent
interaction strengths or for smaller particle numbers. Each filament maintains
its coherence and exhibits an anti-correlated behavior while distinct filaments
show significant losses of coherence and are two-body correlated.
Interestingly, we demonstrate that for an initial broken-axisymmetry phase an
enhanced spin-flip dynamics takes place which can be tuned either via the
linear Zeeman term or the quench amplitude.

construction always straight, allowing one to build efficient geometric
algorithms and data-structures from computational geometry. For example, we
show how to approximate the Smallest Enclosing Ball (SEB) of a set of complex
matrices in the Siegel domains: We compare two implementations of a
generalization of the iterative algorithm of [Badoiu and Clarkson, 2003] in the
Siegel-Poincar\'e disk and in the Siegel-Klein disk. We demonstrate that
geometric computing in the Siegel-Klein disk allows one (i) to bypass the
time-costly recentering operations to the origin (Siegel translations) required

data such as clustering, classification and anomaly detection. Even though many
papers have addressed the problem of how to find motifs in time-series by
proposing new motif discovery algorithms, not much work has been done on the
exploration of the motifs extracted by these algorithms. In this paper, we
argue that visually exploring time-series motifs computed by motif discovery
algorithms can be useful to understand and debug results. To explore the output
of motif discovery algorithms, we propose the use of an adapted Self-Organizing
Map, the DTW-SOM, on the list of motif's centers. In short, DTW-SOM is a
vanilla Self-Organizing Map with three main differences, namely (1) the use the
Dynamic Time Warping distance instead of the Euclidean distance, (2) the
adoption of two new network initialization routines (a random sample
initialization and an anchor initialization) and (3) the adjustment of the
Adaptation phase of the training to work with variable-length time-series
sequences. We test DTW-SOM in a synthetic motif dataset and two real
time-series datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. After an
exploration of results, we conclude that DTW-SOM is capable of extracting
relevant information from a set of motifs and display it in a visualization
that is space-efficient.

  Efficient Scheduling on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)","  Modern computing paradigms, such as cloud computing, are increasingly
adopting GPUs to boost their computing capabilities primarily due to the
heterogeneous nature of AI/ML/deep learning workloads. However, the energy
consumption of GPUs is a critical problem. Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling
(DVFS) is a widely used technique to reduce the dynamic power of GPUs. Yet,
configuring the optimal clock frequency for essential performance requirements
is a non-trivial task due to the complex nonlinear relationship between the
application's runtime performance characteristics, energy, and execution time.
It becomes more challenging when different applications behave distinctively
with similar clock settings. Simple analytical solutions and standard GPU
frequency scaling heuristics fail to capture these intricacies and scale the
frequencies appropriately. In this regard, we propose a data-driven frequency
scaling technique by predicting the power and execution time of a given
application over different clock settings. We collect the data from application
profiling and train the models to predict the outcome accurately. The proposed
solution is generic and can be easily extended to different kinds of workloads
and GPU architectures. Furthermore, using this frequency scaling by prediction
models, we present a deadline-aware application scheduling algorithm to reduce
energy consumption while simultaneously meeting their deadlines. We conduct
real extensive experiments on NVIDIA GPUs using several benchmark applications.
The experiment results have shown that our prediction models have high accuracy
with the average RMSE values of 0.38 and 0.05 for energy and time prediction,
respectively. Also, the scheduling algorithm consumes 15.07% less energy as
compared to the baseline policies.

Surprisingly, the nanoplatelets withstand the high growth temperature of 350

high-quality sample of 24 CALIFA galaxies covering a broad range of visual
morphology, accounting for stellar velocity and velocity dispersion. The shape
of the spaxel-wise probability density function of normalised
$s=j_*/j_{*mean}$, PDF($s$), deviates significantly from the near-universal
initial distribution expected of baryons in a dark matter halo and can be
explained by the expected baryonic effects in galaxy formation that remove and
redistribute angular momentum. Further we find that the observed shape of the
PDF($s$) correlates significantly with photometric morphology, where late-type
galaxies have PDF($s$) that is similar to a normal distribution, whereas early
types have a strongly-skewed PDF($s$) resulting from an excess of low-angular
momentum material. Galaxies that are known to host pseudobulges (bulge Sersic
index $n_b <2.2$) tend to have less skewed bulge PDF($s$), with skewness
$(b_{1rb})\lesssim0.8$. The PDF($s$) encodes both kinematic and photometric
information and appears to be a robust tracer of morphology. Its use is
motivated by the desire to move away from traditional component-based
classifications which are subject to observer bias, to classification on a
galaxy's fundamental (stellar mass, angular momentum) properties. In future,
PDF($s$) may also be useful as a kinematic decomposition tool.

combining a new approach for defect description with several already existing
open-source software packages. Our approach addresses the key challenges posed

which can be compared to known defect types and also yields a distance metric
suited for classification. Vectors which cannot be associated to known

non-equilibrium statistical operator method to address quantum effects induced
by vorticity in the presence of chiral matter and external electromagnetic
field and keeping full covariant and quantum properties of the system. To
investigate the effects of vorticity, this work has been focused on systems
consisting of massless chiral fermions. We recovered the significant quantum
phenomena known in the literature, namely the chiral magnetic effect, the
chiral vortical effect, the axial vortical effect and the chiral separation
effect and we also revealed the presence of additional effects at second-order
on thermal vorticity. This study has also identified and presented the exact
solutions of thermal states for a system at global thermal equilibrium
consisting of chiral massless fermions under the action of an external constant
homogeneous magnetic field. Taking advantage of these exact solutions and
conservation equations, the study also proved that the thermal coefficients
related to first-order effects on thermal vorticity do not receive corrections
from the external electromagnetic field. The same argument revealed existing
relations between those thermal coefficients, even connecting coefficients
related to vorticity to other related to electromagnetic field. For instance,
this analysis has found that the chiral vortical effect and the chiral magnetic
effect conductivities are connected one to the other by a differential
equation. Therefore, this research provides the first steps into deriving the
relations between the effects and the interplay of electromagnetic fields and
vorticity.

  Software Transactional Memory","  Non-volatile memory (NVM), aka persistent memory, is a new paradigm for
memory that preserves its contents even after power loss. The expected ubiquity
of NVM has stimulated interest in the design of novel concepts ensuring
correctness of concurrent programming abstractions in the face of persistency.
So far, this has lead to the design of a number of persistent concurrent data
structures, built to satisfy an associated notion of correctness: durable
linearizability.
  In this paper, we transfer the principle of durable concurrent correctness to
the area of software transactional memory (STM). Software transactional memory
algorithms allow for concurrent access to shared state. Like linearizability
for concurrent data structures, opacity is the established notion of
correctness for STMs. First, we provide a novel definition of durable opacity
extending opacity to handle crashes and recovery in the context of NVM. Second,
we develop a durably opaque version of an existing STM algorithm, namely the
Transactional Mutex Lock (TML). Third, we design a proof technique for durable
opacity based on refinement between TML and an operational characterisation of
durable opacity by adapting the TMS2 specification. Finally, we apply this
proof technique to show that the durable version of TML is indeed durably
opaque. The correctness proof is mechanized within Isabelle.

populations by ejecting strong stellar winds and exploding in energetic
phenomena. It is therefore of high importance that their behaviour is properly
accounted for in synthetic model populations. Here we present nine grids of
stellar evolutionary model sequences, together with finely resolved
interpolated sequences and synthetic populations, of stars with 9-500 Msun and
with metallicities ranging from Solar down to 1/250 Solar. The stellar models
were computed with the 'Bonn' evolutionary code (covering core-hydrogen- and
core-helium-burning phases, both complete). Post-processing for publication has
been done using optimized methods, developed by our team, for massive and very
massive stars. Interpolation and population synthesis were also performed on
the models by our newly developed routine synStars. Eight of the grids
represent slowly rotating massive stars with normal/classical evolution, while
one grid represents fast rotating, chemically-homogeneously evolving models.
Apart from the common stellar parameters such as mass, radius, surface
temperature, luminosity and mass loss rate, we present stellar wind properties
such as estimated wind velocity and kinetic energy of the wind. Additionally,
we provide complete chemical yields of 34 isotopes, and estimates for the
masses of the compact object remnants. The 'Bonn' Optimized Stellar Tracks
(BoOST) project is published as simple tables - including stellar models,
interpolated tracks and synthetic populations - thus ideal for further
scientific applications. For example, star-formation studies could be done with
BoOST to cover broad metallicity ranges, and so could be simulations of
high-redshift galaxies. Additionally, gravitational-wave event rate predictions
could be refined using BoOST by accounting for very massive stars at
low-metallicity.

  Vehicles","  The availability of real-world data is a key element for novel developments
in the fields of automotive and traffic research. Aerial imagery has the major
advantage of recording multiple objects simultaneously and overcomes
limitations such as occlusions. However, there are only few data sets
available. This work describes a process to estimate a precise vehicle position
from aerial imagery. A robust object detection is crucial for reliable results,
hence the state-of-the-art deep neural network Mask-RCNN is applied for that
purpose. Two training data sets are employed: The first one is optimized for
detecting the test vehicle, while the second one consists of randomly selected
images recorded on public roads. To reduce errors, several aspects are
accounted for, such as the drone movement and the perspective projection from a
photograph. The estimated position is comapared with a reference system
installed in the test vehicle. It is shown, that a mean accuracy of 20 cm can
be achieved with flight altitudes up to 100 m, Full-HD resolution and a
frame-by-frame detection. A reliable position estimation is the basis for
further data processing, such as obtaining additional vehicle state variables.
The source code, training weights, labeled data and example videos are made
publicly available. This supports researchers to create new traffic data sets
with specific local conditions.

  fitness of expanding populations","  Unraveling patterns of animals' movements is important for understanding the
fundamental basics of biogeography, tracking range shifts resulting from
climate change, predicting and preventing biological invansions. Many
researchers have modeled animals' dispersal studying their behavior under the
assumptions of some movement strategies pre-determined or affected by some
external factor(s) but none of them have compared the efficiency of different
dispersal strategies in providing population survival and fitness. We
hypothesize that 1) successful expansion could result from some evolutionary
stable strategy (ESS) and 2) such strategy could be based particularly on
deferred gain, when animals invest in travel to reach some high-quality habitat
(""habitat of dream""). Using simulation model we compare the ecological success
of three strategies: i) ""Smart"" - choosing the locally optimal cell; ii)
""Random"" - random movement between cells without taking into account the
quality of the environment; iii) ""Dreamer"" - movements that aims to find ""a
habitat of dream"" with quality much higher than that of the initial and
neighboring cells. The population fitness was measured as survival rate,
dispersal distance, accumulated energy and quality of settled habitat. The most
general conclusion is that while survival and wealth of the population is
affected presumably by overall habitat quality, the dispersal depends mainly on
the behavioral strategy. The ""Dreamer"" strategy or the strategy of deferred
gain belongs to the Pareto frontier in the Fitness$\times$Dispersal space but
only in optimal and suboptimal habitat and in the relatively mild climate.

proposed in order to rectify the issues associated with classification in such
a setting, the classifier in [1], composed of an ensemble of randomly projected
linear discriminants, seems especially promising; it is computationally
efficient and, with the optimal projection dimension parameter setting, is
competitive with the state-of-the-art. In this work, we seek to further
understand the behavior of this classifier through asymptotic analysis. Under
the assumption of a growth regime in which the dataset and projection
dimensions grow at constant rates to each other, we use random matrix theory to
derive asymptotic misclassification probabilities showing the effect of the
ensemble as a regularization of the data sample covariance matrix. The
asymptotic errors further help to identify situations in which the ensemble
offers a performance advantage. We also develop a consistent estimator of the
misclassification probability as an alternative to the computationally-costly
cross-validation estimator, which is conventionally used for parameter tuning.
Finally, we demonstrate the use of our estimator for tuning the projection
dimension on both real and synthetic data.

compartmental model. The control of the epidemic is induced by the aggregation
of individuals' decisions to limit their social interactions: on one side, when
the epidemic is ongoing, an individual is encouraged to diminish his/her
contact rate in order to avoid getting infected, but, on the other side, this
effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers his/her contact rate,
the epidemic vanishes faster but the effort cost may be high. A Mean Field Nash
equilibrium at the population level is formed, resulting in a lower effective
transmission rate of the virus. However, it is not clear that the individual's
interest aligns with that of the society. We prove that the equilibrium exists
and compute it numerically. The equilibrium selects a sub-optimal solution in
comparison to the societal optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by
all individuals), meaning that the cost of anarchy is strictly positive. We
provide numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis. We show that the
divergence between the individual and societal strategies happens after the
epidemic peak but while significant propagation is still underway.

  dense nuclear matter properties","  Recent NICER observation data on PSR J0030+0451 has recently added a unique
mass-radius constraint on the properties of the superdense nuclear matter exist
in the compact stars interior. Such a macroscopic data restrict further the
models, interactions, and its parameters, however, because of the masquarade
problem with reasonable margin. The aim of this paper is to identify the origin
and quantified the magnitude of the theoretical uncertainties. A detailed study
on the effect of different interaction terms and the nuclear parameter values
in the Lagrangian of the extended $\sigma$-$\omega$ model is presented here.
The equation of state was inserted to the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equation
and observable parameters of the neutron star were calculated. We identified,
that the optimal Landau effective mass is the most relevant physical parameter
modifying the macroscopic observable values. Moreover, the compressibility and
symmetry energy terms just generate one-one order of magnitude smaller effect
to this, respectively. We calculated the linear relations between the maximal
mass of a compact star and these microscopic nuclear parameter values within
the physical relevant parameters range. Based on observational data on masses,
we estimated the magnitude of the radii of PSR J1614-2230, PSR J0348+0432, and
PSR J0740+6620 including theoretical uncertainties arising from the interaction
terms of the nuclear matter and their parameter values choice.

neutral and ionized interstellar medium (ISM) components of the dense,
multiphase, circumnuclear region of a galaxy. We use a model including a
thermal and a CX components to describe the high-resolution XMM-Newton/RGS
spectrum of the diffuse emission in the central region of M51. Representative
signatures of CX emission -- especially the prominent OVII forbidden line and
the excess emission in the OVIII Ly$\gamma$ lines -- can be well explained by
the model. Combined with the Chandra images in the OVIII and the OVII bands, we
find the soft X-ray emission is dominated by the jet-driven outflow and its
interaction with the ambient neutral material. The jet-driven outflow itself is
likely a thermal plasma of $\sim 0.59$ keV, with mostly sub-solar abundances.
It runs into the ambient neutral gas, and produces significant CX emission that
accounts for one-fifth of the diffuse X-ray emission in the 7--28 {\AA} band.
The effective interface area in the CX process is one order of magnitude
greater than the geometrical surface area of the jet-driven outflow. The
tenuous outflow driven by the nuclear star formation may also contribute a
small portion to both the diffuse thermal and CX emission. The photoionization
by the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the resonance scattering by the hot
gas itself are disfavored, though the effects from past AGN events may not be
ruled out.

applications including image generation. In particular, generative adversarial
networks (GANs) are able to produce highly realistic pictures as part of tasks
such as image compression. As with standard compression, it is desirable to be
able to automatically assess the perceptual quality of generative images to
monitor and control the encode process. However, existing image quality
algorithms are ineffective on GAN generated content, especially on textured
regions and at high compressions. Here we propose a new naturalness-based image
quality predictor for generative images. Our new GAN picture quality predictor
is built using a multi-stage parallel boosting system based on structural
similarity features and measurements of statistical similarity. To enable model
development and testing, we also constructed a subjective GAN image quality
database containing (distorted) GAN images and collected human opinions of
them. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed GAN IQA model
delivers superior quality predictions on the generative image datasets, as well
as on traditional image quality datasets.

Training transformers, however, requires non-trivial efforts regarding
carefully designing learning rate schedulers and cutting-edge optimizers (the
standard SGD fails to train Transformers effectively). In this paper, we study
Transformer training from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our
analysis reveals that unbalanced gradients are not the root cause of the
instability of training. Instead, we identify an amplification effect that
substantially influences training. Specifically, we observe that for each layer
in a multi-layer Transformer model, heavy dependency on its residual branch
makes training unstable since it amplifies small parameter perturbations (e.g.,
parameter updates) and result in significant disturbances in the model output,
yet a light dependency limits the potential of model training and can lead to
an inferior trained model. Inspired by our analysis, we propose Admin
($\mathbf{Ad}$aptive $\mathbf{m}$odel $\mathbf{in}$itialization) to stabilize
the training in the early stage and unleash its full potential in the late
stage. Extensive experiments show that Admin is more stable, converges faster,
and leads to better performance.

  Recognition","  Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) seeks to model, and thereby exploit,
the dynamic relationship between a human voice and the corresponding mouth
movements. A recently proposed multimodal fusion strategy, AV Align, based on
state-of-the-art sequence to sequence neural networks, attempts to model this
relationship by explicitly aligning the acoustic and visual representations of
speech. This study investigates the inner workings of AV Align and visualises
the audio-visual alignment patterns. Our experiments are performed on two of
the largest publicly available AVSR datasets, TCD-TIMIT and LRS2. We find that
AV Align learns to align acoustic and visual representations of speech at the
frame level on TCD-TIMIT in a generally monotonic pattern. We also determine
the cause of initially seeing no improvement over audio-only speech recognition
on the more challenging LRS2. We propose a regularisation method which involves
predicting lip-related Action Units from visual representations. Our
regularisation method leads to better exploitation of the visual modality, with
performance improvements between 7% and 30% depending on the noise level.
Furthermore, we show that the alternative Watch, Listen, Attend, and Spell
network is affected by the same problem as AV Align, and that our proposed
approach can effectively help it learn visual representations. Our findings
validate the suitability of the regularisation method to AVSR and encourage
researchers to rethink the multimodal convergence problem when having one
dominant modality.

diffeomorphisms in the Sobolev norm consists of the functions which are
non-crossing (NC), i.e., the functions which can be uniformly approximated by
continuous one-to-one functions on the grids. A deep simplification of this
property is to consider curves instead of grids, so considering functions which
are non-crossing on lines (NCL). Since the NCL property is way easier to check,
it would be extremely positive if they actually coincide, while it is only
obvious that NC implies NCL. We show that in general NCL does not imply NC, but
the implication becomes true with the additional assumption that $\det(Du)>0$
a.e., which is a very common assumption in nonlinear elasticity.

in N. Penalva et al. [Phys. Rev. D100, 113007 (2019)], with the addition of new
physics (NP) tensor terms. In this way, all the NP effective Hamiltonians that
are considered in lepton flavour universality violation (LFUV) studies have now
been included. Besides, we now also give general expressions that allow for
complex Wilson coefficients. The scheme developed is totally general and it can
be applied to any charged current semileptonic decay, involving any quark
flavors or initial and final hadron states. We show that all the hadronic
input, including NP effects, can be parametrized in terms of 16 Lorentz scalar
structure functions. In the second part of this work, we use this formalism to
obtain the complete NP effects in the $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda_c \tau\bar\nu_\tau$
semileptonic decay, where LFUV, if finally confirmed, is also expected to be
seen. We stress the relevance of the center of mass (CM) $d^2\Gamma/(d\omega
d\cos\theta_\ell)$ and laboratory (LAB) $d^2\Gamma/(d\omega dE_\ell)$
differential decay widths. While models with very different strengths in the NP
terms give the same differential $d\Gamma/d\omega$ and total decay widths for
this decay, they predict very different numerical results for some of the
$\cos\theta_\ell$ and $E_\ell$ coefficient-functions that determine the above
two distributions. Thus, the combined analysis of the CM $d^2\Gamma/(d\omega
d\cos\theta_\ell)$ and LAB $d^2\Gamma/ (d\omega dE_\ell)$ differential decay
widths will help clarifying what kind of NP is a better candidate in order to
explain LFUV.

detector off the French coast will instrument several megatons of seawater with
photosensors. Its main objective is the determination of the neutrino mass
ordering. This work aims at demonstrating the general applicability of deep
convolutional neural networks to neutrino telescopes, using simulated datasets
for the KM3NeT/ORCA detector as an example. To this end, the networks are
employed to achieve reconstruction and classification tasks that constitute an
alternative to the analysis pipeline presented for KM3NeT/ORCA in the KM3NeT
Letter of Intent. They are used to infer event reconstruction estimates for the
energy, the direction, and the interaction point of incident neutrinos. The
spatial distribution of Cherenkov light generated by charged particles induced
in neutrino interactions is classified as shower- or track-like, and the main
background processes associated with the detection of atmospheric neutrinos are
recognized. Performance comparisons to machine-learning classification and
maximum-likelihood reconstruction algorithms previously developed for

  (Technical Report)","  As data volume grows extensively, data profiling helps to extract metadata of
large-scale data. However, one kind of metadata, order statistics, is difficult
to be computed because they are not mergeable or incremental. Thus, the
limitation of time and memory space does not support their computation on
large-scale data. In this paper, we focus on an order statistic, quantiles, and
present a comprehensive analysis of studies on approximate quantile
computation. Both deterministic algorithms and randomized algorithms that
compute approximate quantiles over streaming models or distributed models are
covered. Then, multiple techniques for improving the efficiency and performance
of approximate quantile algorithms in various scenarios, such as skewed data
and high-speed data streams, are presented. Finally, we conclude with coverage
of existing packages in different languages and with a brief discussion of the
future direction in this area.

and the estimation of the proportion $\pi_{0}$ of true null hypotheses. The
Schweder-Spj\o tvoll estimator $\hat{\pi}_0$ utilizes marginal $p$-values and
only works properly if the $p$-values that correspond to the true null
hypotheses are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$
($\mathrm{Uni}[0,1]$-distributed). In the case of composite null hypotheses,
marginal $p$-values are usually computed under least favorable parameter
configurations (LFCs). Thus, they are stochastically larger than
$\mathrm{Uni}[0,1]$ under non-LFCs in the null hypotheses. When using these
LFC-based $p$-values, $\hat{\pi}_0$ tends to overestimate $\pi_{0}$. We
introduce a new way of randomizing $p$-values that depends on a tuning
parameter $c\in[0,1]$, such that $c=0$ and $c=1$ lead to
$\mathrm{Uni}[0,1]$-distributed $p$-values, which are independent of the data,
and to the original LFC-based $p$-values, respectively. For a certain value
$c=c^{\star}$ the bias of $\hat{\pi}_0$ is minimized when using our randomized
$p$-values. This often also entails a smaller mean squared error of the
estimator as compared to the usage of the LFC-based $p$-values. We analyze
these points theoretically, and we demonstrate them numerically in computer
simulations under various standard statistical models.

mechanical modeling of the strain-induced crystallization in unfilled polymers.
This phenomenon is of particular importance for the mechanical properties of
polymers as well as for their manufacturing and the application. The model
developed uses the principle of the minimum of dissipation potential and
assumes two internal variables: the deformations due to crystallization and the
regularity of the network. In addition to the dissipation potential necessary
for the derivation of evolution equations, the well-established Arruda-Boyce
model is chosen to depict the elastic behavior of the polymer. Two special
features of the model are the evolution direction depending on the stress state
and the distinction of crystallization during the loading and unloading phase.
The model has been implemented into the finite element method and applied for
numerical simulation of the growth and shrinkage of the crystal regions during
a cyclic tension test for samples with different initial configurations. The
concept enables the visualization of the microstructure evolution, yielding
information that is still inaccessible by experimental techniques.

  Crime Pattern Theory in Large Cities","  Crime has been previously explained by social characteristics of the
residential population and, as stipulated by crime pattern theory, might also
be linked to human movements of non-residential visitors. Yet a full empirical
validation of the latter is lacking. The prime reason is that prior studies are
limited to aggregated statistics of human visitors rather than mobility flows
and, because of that, neglect the temporal dynamics of individual human
movements. As a remedy, we provide the first work which studies the ability of
granular human mobility in describing and predicting crime concentrations at an
hourly scale. For this purpose, we propose the use of data from location
technology platforms. This type of data allows us to trace individual
transitions and, therefore, we succeed in distinguishing different mobility
flows that (i) are incoming or outgoing from a neighborhood, (ii) remain within
it, or (iii) refer to transitions where people only pass through the
neighborhood. Our evaluation infers mobility flows by leveraging an anonymized
dataset from Foursquare that includes almost 14.8 million consecutive check-ins
in three major U.S. cities. According to our empirical results, mobility flows
are significantly and positively linked to crime. These findings advance our
theoretical understanding, as they provide confirmatory evidence for crime
pattern theory. Furthermore, our novel use of digital location services data
proves to be an effective tool for crime forecasting. It also offers
unprecedented granularity when studying the connection between human mobility
and crime.

  particles","  Since their invention in the 1980s [1], optical tweezers have found a wide
range of applications, from biophotonics and mechanobiology to microscopy and
optomechanics [2, 3, 4, 5]. Simulations of the motion of microscopic particles
held by optical tweezers are often required to explore complex phenomena and to
interpret experimental data [6, 7, 8, 9]. For the sake of computational
efficiency, these simulations usually model the optical tweezers as an harmonic
potential [10, 11]. However, more physically-accurate optical-scattering models
[12, 13, 14, 15] are required to accurately model more onerous systems; this is
especially true for optical traps generated with complex fields [16, 17, 18,
19]. Although accurate, these models tend to be prohibitively slow for problems
with more than one or two degrees of freedom (DoF) [20], which has limited
their broad adoption. Here, we demonstrate that machine learning permits one to
combine the speed of the harmonic model with the accuracy of optical-scattering
models. Specifically, we show that a neural network can be trained to rapidly
and accurately predict the optical forces acting on a microscopic particle. We
demonstrate the utility of this approach on two phenomena that are
prohibitively slow to accurately simulate otherwise: the escape dynamics of
swelling microparticles in an optical trap, and the rotation rates of particles
in a superposition of beams with opposite orbital angular momenta. Thanks to
its high speed and accuracy, this method can greatly enhance the range of
phenomena that can be efficiently simulated and studied.

chemistry and materials sciences, measured data are becoming bigger and more
complex. The observables are typically a function of several stimuli resulting
in multidimensional data sets spanning a range of experimental parameters. As
an example, a common approach to study ferroelectric switching is to observe
effects of applied electric field, but switching can also be enacted by
pressure and is influenced by strain fields, material composition, temperature,
time, etc. Moreover, the parameters are usually interdependent, so that their
decoupling toward univariate measurements or analysis may not be
straightforward. On the other hand, both explicit and hidden parameters provide
an opportunity to gain deeper insight into the measured properties, provided
there exists a well-defined path to capture and analyze such data. Here, we
introduce a new, two-dimensional approach to represent hysteretic response of a
material system to applied electric field. Utilizing ferroelectric polarization
as a model hysteretic property, we demonstrate how explicit consideration of
electromechanical response to two rather than one control voltages enables
significantly more transparent and robust interpretation of observed
hysteresis, such as differentiating between charge trapping and
ferroelectricity. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the new data representation
readily fits into a variety of machinelearning methodologies, from unsupervised
classification of the origins of hysteretic response via linear clustering
algorithms to neural-network-based inference of the sample temperature based on
the specific morphology of hysteresis.

for the preservation of cultural heritage. Like in most dance forms, a
Bharatanatyam dancer performs in synchronization with structured rhythmic
music, called Sollukattu, which comprises instrumental beats and vocalized
utterances (bols) to create a rhythmic music structure. Computer analysis of
Bharatanatyam, therefore, requires a structural analysis of Sollukattus. In
this paper, we use speech processing techniques to recognize bols. Exploiting
the predefined structures of Sollukattus and the detected bols, we recognize
the Sollukattu. We estimate the tempo period by two methods. Finally, we
generate a complete annotation of the audio signal by beat marking. For this,
we also use the information of beats detected from the onset envelope of a

a particular task for which data is very limited: the segmentation of ancient
Egyptian mummies CT scans. We aim at digitally unwrapping the mummy and
identify different segments such as body, bandages and jewelry. The problem is
complex because of the lack of annotated data for the different semantic
regions to segment, thus discouraging the use of strongly supervised
approaches. We, therefore, propose a weakly supervised and efficient
interactive segmentation method to solve this challenging problem. After
segmenting the wrapped mummy from its exterior region using histogram analysis
and template matching, we first design a voxel distance measure to find an
approximate solution for the body and bandage segments. Here, we use geodesic
distances since voxel features as well as spatial relationship among voxels is
incorporated in this measure. Next, we refine the solution using a GrabCut
based segmentation together with a tracking method on the slices of the scan
that assigns labels to different regions in the volume, using limited
supervision in the form of scribbles drawn by the user. The efficiency of the
proposed method is demonstrated using visualizations and validated through
quantitative measures and qualitative unwrapping of the mummy.

algebra. We study the bicommutant categories which arise as the commutant
$\mathcal{C}'$ of a fully faithful representation
$\mathcal{C}\to\operatorname{Bim}(R)$ of a unitary fusion category
$\mathcal{C}$. Using results of Izumi, Popa, and Tomatsu about existence and
uniqueness of representations of unitary (multi)fusion categories, we prove
that if $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are Morita equivalent unitary fusion
categories, then their commutant categories $\mathcal{C}'$ and $\mathcal{D}'$
are equivalent as bicommutant categories. In particular, they are equivalent as
tensor categories: \[
\Big(\,\,\mathcal{C}\,\,\simeq_{\text{Morita}}\,\,\mathcal{D}\,\,\Big)
\qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad
\Big(\,\,\mathcal{C}'\,\,\simeq_{\text{tensor}}\,\,\mathcal{D}'\,\,\Big). \]
This categorifies the well-known result according to which the commutants (in
some representations) of Morita equivalent finite dimensional $\rm
C^*$-algebras are isomorphic von Neumann algebras, provided the representations
are `big enough'.
  We also introduce a notion of positivity for bi-involutive tensor categories.
For dagger categories, positivity is a property (the property of being a $\rm
C^*$-category). But for bi-involutive tensor categories, positivity is extra
structure. We show that unitary fusion categories and $\operatorname{Bim}(R)$
admit distinguished positive structures, and that fully faithful
representations $\mathcal{C}\to\operatorname{Bim}(R)$ automatically respect
these positive structures.

useful tool to characterize the symmetry protected topological states, while
the experimental evidence is still elusive. Recently, topolectrical circuits
have emerged as a simple yet very powerful platform for studying topological

demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the localized second-order

first-principles methods is a challenging task due to the interplay of
vibrational and magnetic degrees of freedom. The most difficult contribution to
include in simulations is represented by the longitudinal magnetic degrees of
freedom (LSF) due to their inherent many-body nature; nonetheless, schemes that
enable to take into account this effect on a semiclassical level have been
proposed and employed in the investigation of magnetic systems. However,
assessment of the effect of vibrations on LSF is lacking in the literature. For
this reason, in this work we develop a supercell approach within the framework
of constrained density functional theory to calculate self-consistently the
size of local-environment-dependent magnetic moments in the paramagnetic,
high-temperature state in presence of lattice vibrations and for liquid Fe in
different conditions. First, we consider the case of bcc Fe at the Curie
temperature and ambient pressure. Then, we perform a similar analysis on bcc Fe
at Earth's inner core conditions, and we find that LSF stabilize non-zero
moments which affect atomic forces and electronic density of states of the
system. Finally, we employ the present scheme on liquid Fe at the melting point
at ambient pressure, and at Earth's outer core conditions ($p \approx 200$ GPa,
$T \approx 6000$ K). In both cases, we obtain local magnetic moments of sizes
comparable to the solid-state counterparts.

Kyle's model, of agents' interplay in the financial markets, are aligned with
the phenomena observed in publicly available trades and quotes data.
Specifically, we confirmed that for small signed order-flows, the price impact
grows linearly with increase in the order-flow imbalance. We have, further,
implemented a machine learning algorithm to forecast market impact given a
signed order-flow. Our findings suggest that machine learning models can be
used in estimation of financial variables; and predictive accuracy of such
learning algorithms can surpass the performance of traditional statistical
approaches.
  Understanding the determinants of price impact is crucial for several
reasons. From a theoretical stance, modelling the impact provides a statistical
measure of liquidity. Practitioners adopt impact models as a pre-trade tool to
estimate expected transaction costs and optimize the execution of their
strategies. This further serves as a post-trade valuation benchmark as
suboptimal execution can significantly deteriorate a portfolio performance.
  More broadly, the price impact reflects the balance of liquidity across
markets. This is of central importance to regulators as it provides an
all-encompassing explanation of the correlation between market design and
systemic risk, enabling regulators to design more stable and efficient markets.

typical for a single-beam optical dipole trap. We focus on the case of
repulsive Bose-Fermi interaction and develop mean-field models to simulate the

solutions in the regimes of phase separation and weak interaction. We obtain
static density profiles and the frequency of the radial breathing mode, which

hybrid star. Quarkyonic matter is an approach in which both quarks and nucleons
appear as quasi-particles in a crossover transition, and provides an explicit
realization of early ideas concerning quark matter (e.g., the MIT bag model).
This description has recently been employed by McLerran and Reddy to model
chargeless (pure neutron) matter with an approach that has the virtue that the
speed of sound rises quickly at a neutron-quark transition so as to satisfy
observational constraints on the neutron star maximum mass ($\gtrsim2M_\odot$)
and the radius of a $1.4M_\odot$ star ($R_{1.4}\lesssim 13.5$ km). Traditional
models involving first-order transitions result in softer pressure-energy
density relations that have difficulty satisfying these constraints except with
very narrow choices of parameters. We propose a variation of quarkyonic matter
involving protons and leptons whose energy can be explicitly minimized to
achieve both chemical and beta equilibrium, which cannot be done in the
chargeless formulation. Quarkyonic stellar models are able to satisfy observed
mass and radius constraints with a wide range of model parameters, avoiding the
obligatory fine-tuning of conventional hybrid star models, including requiring
the transition density to be very close to the nuclear saturation density. Our
formulation fits experimental and theoretical properties of the nuclear
symmetry energy and pure neutron matter, and contains as few as three free
parameters. This makes it an ideal tool for the study of high-density matter

an exact self-dual sector leading to an infinity of exact Skyrmion solutions
with arbitrary topological (baryon) charge. The self-dual sector is made
possible by the introduction, in addition to the usual three SU(2) Skyrme
fields, of six scalar fields assembled in a symmetric and invertible three
dimensional matrix h. The action presents quadratic and quartic terms in
derivatives of the Skyrme fields, but instead of the group indices being
contracted by the SU(2) Killing form, they are contracted with the h-matrix in
the quadratic term, and by its inverse on the quartic term. Due to these extra
fields the static version of the model, as well as its self-duality equations,
are conformally invariant on the three dimensional space R^3. We show that the
static and self-dual sectors of such a theory are equivalent, and so the only
non-self-dual solution must be time dependent. We also show that for any
configuration of the Skyrme SU(2) fields, the h-fields adjust themselves to
satisfy the self-duality equations, and so the theory has plenty of non-trivial
topological solutions. We present explicit exact solutions using a holomorphic
rational ansatz, as well as a toroidal ansatz based on the conformal symmetry.
We point to possible extensions of the model that break the conformal symmetry
as well as the self-dual sector, and that can perhaps lead to interesting
physical applications.

architecture of the Ruddlesden-Popper phase of these materials allows for
distinct directionality of the vibrational modes withrespect to the main axes
of the pseudocubic lattice in the octahedral plane. Here, we study the
directionality of the fundamental phonon modes in single exfoliated
Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite flakes with polarized Raman spectroscopy at
ultralow-frequencies. A wealth of Raman bands is distinguished in the range
from 15-150 cm-1 (2-15 meV), whose features depend on the organic cation
species, on temperature, and on the direction of the linear polarization of the
incident light. By controlling the angle of the linear polarization of the
excitation laser with respect to the in-plane axes of the octahedral layer, we
gain detailed information on the symmetry of the vibrational modes. The choice
of two different organic moieties, phenethylammonium (PEA) and butylammonium
(BA) allows to discern the influence of the linker molecules, evidencing strong
anisotropy of the vibrations for the (PEA)2PbBr4 samples. Temperature dependent
Raman measurements reveal that the broad phonon bands observed at room
temperature consist of a series of sharp modes, and that such mode splitting
strongly differs for the different organic moieties and vibrational bands.

learning architectures is not trivial in this context, because of the
challenges in creating suitable large scale annotated datasets. This issue has
been traditionally circumvented through the use of synthetic datasets, that
have become a popular resource in this field. They have been released with the
need to develop semantic segmentation algorithms able to close the visual
domain shift between the training and test data. Although exacerbated by the
use of artificial data, the problem is extremely relevant in this field even
when training on real data. Indeed, weather conditions, viewpoint changes and
variations in the city appearances can vary considerably from car to car, and
even at test time for a single, specific vehicle. How to deal with domain
adaptation in semantic segmentation, and how to leverage effectively several
different data distributions (source domains) are important research questions
in this field. To support work in this direction, this paper contributes a new
large scale, synthetic dataset for semantic segmentation with more than 100
different source visual domains. The dataset has been created to explicitly
address the challenges of domain shift between training and test data in
various weather and view point conditions, in seven different city types.
Extensive benchmark experiments assess the dataset, showcasing open challenges
for the current state of the art. The dataset will be available at:

  inside a superconducting dome","  Recent experiments in unconventional superconductors, and in particular
iron-based materials, have reported evidence of an antiferromagnetic quantum
critical point (AFM-QCP) emerging inside the superconducting dome of the phase
diagram. Fluctuations associated with such an AFM-QCP are expected to promote
unusual temperature dependencies of thermodynamic quantities. Here, we compute
the $T$ dependence of the specific heat $C(T)$ deep inside a fully gapped
$s^{+-}$ superconducting state as the AFM-QCP is approached. We find that, at
the AFM-QCP, the specific heat $C(T)$ vanishes quadratically with temperature,
as opposed to the typical exponential suppression seen in fully-gapped BCS
superconductors. This robust result is due to a non-analytic contribution to
the free-energy arising from the general form of the bosonic (AFM) propagator
in the SC state. Away from the AFM-QCP, as temperature is lowered, $C(T)$ shows
a crossover from a $T^2$ behavior to an exponential behavior, with the
crossover temperature scale set by the value of the superconducting gap and the
distance to the QCP. We argue that these features in the specific heat can be
used to unambiguously determine the existence of AFM-QCPs inside the
superconducting domes of iron-based and other fully gapped unconventional
superconductors.

from [extreme] amenability of the (topological) group $Aut(M)$ for all
sufficiently large $\aleph_{0}$-homogeneous countable models $M$ of $T$
(assuming $T$ to be countable), but is radically less restrictive. First, we
study basic properties of amenable theories, giving many equivalent conditions.
Then, applying a version of the stabilizer theorem from [5], we prove that if
$T$ is amenable, then $T$ is G-compact, namely Lascar strong types and
Kim-Pillay strong types over $\emptyset$ coincide. This extends and essentially
generalizes a similar result proved via different methods for
$\omega$-categorical theories in [14]. In the special case when amenability is
witnessed by $\emptyset$-definable global Keisler measures (which is for
example the case for amenable $\omega$-categorical theories), we also give a
different proof, based on stability in continuous logic.

between normal pulsars and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXP) and soft gamma-ray
repeaters (SGR) with the similar values of periods and magnetic fields. It is
shown that the dependence of period derivatives on periods for pulsars with
long periods is $dP/dt \propto P^{1.67}$. This means that we must search for
another braking mechanism differing from the magnetic dipole one which gives
$dP/dt \propto P^{-1}$ or use some specific distributions of parameters. On the
other hand, radio pulsars with strong magnetic fields and AXP/SGR can be
described by the magnetic dipole model. Radio pulsars with P > 2 sec have ages
on average two orders of magnitude higher than objects with $Bs > 4.4 \times

Logic (DL) entailments. Instead of concentrating on a specific DL and proof
calculus for this DL, we introduce a general framework in which proofs are
represented as labeled, directed hypergraphs, where each hyperedge corresponds
to a single sound derivation step. On the theoretical side, we investigate the
complexity of deciding whether a certain consequence has a proof of size at
most $n$ along the following orthogonal dimensions: (i)~the underlying proof
system is polynomial or exponential; (ii)~proofs may or may not reuse already
derived consequences; and (iii)~the number $n$ is represented in unary or

problem for all but one of the possible combinations of these options. On the
practical side, we have developed and implemented an approach for generating
proofs for expressive DLs based on a non-standard reasoning task called
forgetting. We have evaluated this approach on a set of realistic ontologies

finding that forgetting-based proofs are often better w.r.t. different measures

(SDW). It enters into short range SDW phase below T$_{MIT}$ and long range SDW

role of misfit layers (rocksalt/Ca$_2$CoO$_3$ \& triangular/CoO$_2$) in these

magnetization and resistivity) and microscopic (neutron diffraction and X-ray
absorption fine structure spectroscopy) measurements on pure (CCO) and Tb
substituted in the rocksalt layer of CCO (CCO1), magnetic correlations in both
subsystems of this misfit compound are unraveled. CCO is found to exhibit
glassiness, as well as exchange bias (EB) effects, while CCO1 does not exhibit
glassiness, albeit it shows weaker EB effect. Our results show that the
magneto-crystalline anisotropy associated with the rocksalt layer acts as a
source of pinning, which is responsible for EB effect as well as for
localization of spins in triangular (CoO$_2$) layer, giving rise to glassiness
in CCO. By combining local structure investigations from extended X-ray
absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and neutron diffraction results

extracting a target speaker's voice from a multi-talker environment. It is
common to perform the extraction in frequency-domain, and reconstruct the
time-domain signal from the extracted magnitude and estimated phase spectra.
However, such an approach is adversely affected by the inherent difficulty of
phase estimation. Inspired by Conv-TasNet, we propose a time-domain speaker
extraction network (SpEx) that converts the mixture speech into multi-scale
embedding coefficients instead of decomposing the speech signal into magnitude
and phase spectra. In this way, we avoid phase estimation. The SpEx network
consists of four network components, namely speaker encoder, speech encoder,
speaker extractor, and speech decoder. Specifically, the speech encoder
converts the mixture speech into multi-scale embedding coefficients, the
speaker encoder learns to represent the target speaker with a speaker
embedding. The speaker extractor takes the multi-scale embedding coefficients
and target speaker embedding as input and estimates a receptive mask. Finally,
the speech decoder reconstructs the target speaker's speech from the masked
embedding coefficients. We also propose a multi-task learning framework and a
multi-scale embedding implementation. Experimental results show that the
proposed SpEx achieves 37.3%, 37.7% and 15.0% relative improvements over the
best baseline in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR), scale-invariant SDR
(SI-SDR), and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) under an open

integrates the long-term dynamical evolution of multiple systems with any
number of bodies and hierarchical structure, provided that the system is
composed of nested binaries. In the formalism underlying SecularMultiple, we
previously averaged over all orbits in the system. This approximation
significantly speeds up numerical integration of the equations of motion,
making large population synthesis studies possible. However, the orbit
averaging approximation can break down when the secular evolution timescale of
the system is comparable to or shorter than any of the orbital periods in the
system. Here, we present an update to SecularMultiple in which we incorporate
hybrid integration techniques, and orbit-averaging corrections. With this
update, the user can specify which orbits should be integrated directly
(without averaging), or assuming averaged orbits. For orbits that are
integrated directly, we implemented two integration techniques, one which is
based on the regularised Kustaanheimo-Stiefel equations of motion in element
form. We also implemented analytical orbit-averaging corrections for pairwise
interactions to quadrupole order. The updates presented here provide more
flexibility for integrating the long-term dynamical evolution of hierarchical
multiple systems. By effectively combining direct integration and orbit
averaging the long-term evolution can be accurately computed, but with
significantly lower computational cost compared to existing direct N-body
codes. We give a number of examples in which the new features are beneficial.

been estimated as a prominent timescale of solar magnetic activity at high

two different resources is of both theoretical and practical significance. The
common choice for quantifying the nonlocality of a two-qubit state is the
maximal violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. That for
entanglement is entanglement of formation, which is a function of the
concurrence. In this paper, we systematically investigate the quantitative
relationship between the entanglement and nonlocality of a general two-qubit

two-qubit state, which depends on the state's entanglement. We investigate the
condition that the nonlocality of two different two-qubit states can be
optimally stimulated by the same nonlocality test setting and find the class of
two-qubit state pairs that have this property. Finally, we obtain the necessary

In this work, we investigate the role of radial migration on the Galactic disk
based on a large sample of 146 open clusters with homogeneous metallicity and
age from Netopil et al. and kinematics calculated from Gaia DR2. The birth site
Rb, guiding radius Rg and other orbital parameters are calculated, and the
migration distance |Rg-Rb| is obtained, which is a combination of metallicity,
kinematics and age information. It is found that 44% open clusters have
|Rg-Rb|< 1 kpc, for which radial migration (churning) is not significant. Among
the remaining 56% open clusters with |Rg-Rb|> 1 kpc, young ones with t<1.0 Gyr
tend to migrate inward, while older clusters usually migrate outward. Different
mechanisms of radial migration between young and old clusters are suggested
based on their different migration rates, Galactic locations and orbital
parameters. For the old group, we propose a plausible way to estimate migration
rate and obtain a reasonable value of 1.5(+-0.5) kpc/Gyr based on ten
intermediate-age clusters at the outer disk, where the existence of several

allows for adiabatic population transfer between the two ends of a
chainwise-connected quantum system. The process requires large temporal areas
of the driving pulsed fields (pump and Stokes) in order to suppress the
nonadiabatic couplings and thereby to make adiabatic evolution possible. To
this end, in the present paper a variation of multistate STIRAP, which
accelerates and improves the population transfer, is presented. In addition to
the usual pump and Stokes fields it uses shortcut fields applied between the
states, which form the dark state of the system. The shortcuts cancel the
couplings between the dark state and the other adiabatic states thereby
resulting (in the ideal case) in a unit transition probability between the two
end states of the chain. Specific examples of five-state systems formed of the
magnetic sublevels of the transitions between two degenerate levels with
angular momenta $J_g=2$ and $J_e=1$ or $J_e=2$ are considered in detail, for
which the shortcut fields are derived analytically. The proposed method is
simpler than the usual ""shortcuts to adiabaticity"" recipe, which prescribes
shortcut fields between all states of the system, while the present proposal
uses shortcut fields between the sublevels forming the dark state only. The
results are of potential interest in applications where high-fidelity quantum
control is essential, e.g. quantum information, atom optics, formation of
ultracold molecules, cavity QED, etc.

signal-to-noise ratio of 19. The binary is different from observations during
the first two observing runs most notably due to its asymmetric masses: a ~30
solar mass black hole merged with a ~8 solar mass black hole companion. The
more massive black hole rotated with a dimensionless spin magnitude between
0.17 and 0.59 (90% probability). Asymmetric systems are predicted to emit
gravitational waves with stronger contributions from higher multipoles, and
indeed we find strong evidence for gravitational radiation beyond the leading
quadrupolar order in the observed signal. A suite of tests performed on

Gaussian processes, the surrogate models of choice in Bayesian optimisation,
are often used with a constant prior mean function equal to the arithmetic mean
of the observed function values. We show that the rate of convergence can
depend sensitively on the choice of mean function. We empirically investigate 8
mean functions (constant functions equal to the arithmetic mean, minimum,
median and maximum of the observed function evaluations, linear, quadratic
polynomials, random forests and RBF networks), using 10 synthetic test problems
and two real-world problems, and using the Expected Improvement and Upper

  We find that for design dimensions $\ge5$ using a constant mean function
equal to the worst observed quality value is consistently the best choice on
the synthetic problems considered. We argue that this worst-observed-quality
function promotes exploitation leading to more rapid convergence. However, for
the real-world tasks the more complex mean functions capable of modelling the

strings: Given a text $T$, a pattern $P$, and a threshold $k$, find (the
starting positions of) all substrings of $T$ that are at distance at most $k$
from $P$. We consider the two most fundamental string metrics: the Hamming
distance and the edit distance. Under the Hamming distance, we search for
substrings of $T$ that have at most $k$ mismatches with $P$, while under the
edit distance, we search for substrings of $T$ that can be transformed to $P$
with at most $k$ edits.
  Exact occurrences of $P$ in $T$ have a very simple structure: If we assume
for simplicity that $|T| \le 3|P|/2$ and trim $T$ so that $P$ occurs both as a
prefix and as a suffix of $T$, then both $P$ and $T$ are periodic with a common
period. However, an analogous characterization for the structure of occurrences
with up to $k$ mismatches was proved only recently by Bringmann et al.
[SODA'19]: Either there are $O(k^2)$ $k$-mismatch occurrences of $P$ in $T$, or
both $P$ and $T$ are at Hamming distance $O(k)$ from strings with a common
period $O(m/k)$. We tighten this characterization by showing that there are
$O(k)$ $k$-mismatch occurrences in the case when the pattern is not
(approximately) periodic, and we lift it to the edit distance setting, where we
tightly bound the number of $k$-edit occurrences by $O(k^2)$ in the
non-periodic case. Our proofs are constructive and let us obtain a unified
framework for approximate pattern matching for both considered distances. We
showcase the generality of our framework with results for the fully-compressed
setting (where $T$ and $P$ are given as a straight-line program) and for the
dynamic setting (where we extend a data structure of Gawrychowski et al.

joint discriminator to compute the reconstruction error. Larger reconstruction
error indicates the occurrence of fall in a video sequence. The experiments on
a publicly available thermal fall dataset show the superior results obtained in
comparison to standard baseline.

  Programming-by-Demonstration Systems","  An important concern in end user development (EUD) is accidentally embedding
personal information in program artifacts when sharing them. This issue is
particularly important in GUI-based programming-by-demonstration (PBD) systems
due to the lack of direct developer control of script contents. Prior studies
reported that these privacy concerns were the main barrier to script sharing in
EUD. We present a new approach that can identify and obfuscate the potential
personal information in GUI-based PBD scripts based on the uniqueness of
information entries with respect to the corresponding app GUI context. Compared
with the prior approaches, ours supports broader types of personal information
beyond explicitly pre-specified ones, requires minimal user effort, addresses
the threat of re-identification attacks, and can work with third-party apps
from any task domain. Our approach also recovers obfuscated fields locally on
the script consumer's side to preserve the shared scripts' transparency,
readability, robustness, and generalizability. Our evaluation shows that our
approach (1) accurately identifies the potential personal information in
scripts across different apps in diverse task domains; (2) allows end-user
developers to feel comfortable sharing their own scripts; and (3) enables
script consumers to understand the operation of shared scripts despite the
obfuscated fields.

goal-conditioned. For the locomotion task, this translates to data collection
using a policy learnt by the agent for walking straight in one direction, and
using that data to learn a goal-conditioned policy that enables the agent to
walk in any direction. The data collection policy used should be invariant to
the direction the agent is facing i.e. regardless of its initial orientation,
the agent should take the same actions to walk forward. We exploit this
property to learn a goal-conditioned policy using two key ideas: (1) augmenting
data by generating trajectories with the same actions in different directions,
and (2) learning an encoder that enforces invariance between these rotated
trajectories with a Siamese framework. We show that our approach outperforms
existing RL algorithms on 3-D locomotion agents like Ant, Humanoid and
Minitaur.

Evaluating the distance between a given configuration to the closest singular
one is of interest for industrial applications (e.g.\ singularity-free path
planning). For parallel manipulators of Stewart-Gough type, geometric
meaningful distance measures are known, which are used for the computation of
the singularity distance as the global minimizer of an optimization problem. In
the case of hexapods and linear pentapods the critical points of the
corresponding polynomial Lagrange function cannot be found by the Grobner basis

its Hamiltonian parameters is driven across a first-order quantum transition
(FOQT). In particular, we consider systems subject to fixed boundary
conditions, favoring one of the two phases separated by the FOQT: more
precisely, boundary conditions that favor the same magnetized phase (EFBC) or
opposite phases (OFBC) at the two ends of the chain. These issues are
investigated within the paradigmatic one-dimensional quantum Ising model, in
which FOQTs are driven by the longitudinal magnetic field h. We study the
dynamic behavior for an instantaneous quench and for a protocol in which h is
slowly varied across the FOQT. We develop a dynamic finite-size scaling theory
for both EFBC and OFBC, which displays some remarkable differences with respect
to the case of neutral boundary conditions. The corresponding relevant time
scale shows a qualitative different size dependence in the two cases: it
increases exponentially with the size in the case of EFBC, and as a power of
the size in the case of OFBC.

  Degeneracies","  Phantom dark energy can produce amplified cosmic acceleration at late times,
thus increasing the value of $H_0$ favored by CMB data and releasing the
tension with local measurements of $H_0$. We show that the best fit value of
$H_0$ in the context of the CMB power spectrum is degenerate with a constant
equation of state parameter $w$, in accordance with the approximate effective
linear equation $H_0 + 30.93\; w - 36.47 = 0$ ($H_0$ in $km \; sec^{-1} \;
Mpc^{-1}$). This equation is derived by assuming that both $\Omega_{0 \rm
m}h^2$ and $d_A=\int_0^{z_{rec}}\frac{dz}{H(z)}$ remain constant (for invariant
CMB spectrum) and equal to their best fit Planck/$\Lambda$CDM values as $H_0$,
$\Omega_{0 \rm m}$ and $w$ vary. For $w=-1$, this linear degeneracy equation
leads to the best fit $H_0=67.4 \; km \; sec^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}$ as expected. For
$w=-1.22$ the corresponding predicted CMB best fit Hubble constant is $H_0=74
\; km \; sec^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}$ which is identical with the value obtained by
local distance ladder measurements while the best fit matter density parameter
is predicted to decrease since $\Omega_{0 \rm m}h^2$ is fixed. We verify the
above $H_0-w$ degeneracy equation by fitting a $w$CDM model with fixed values
of $w$ to the Planck TT spectrum showing also that the quality of fit
($\chi^2$) is similar to that of $\Lambda$CDM. However, when including SnIa,
BAO or growth data the quality of fit becomes worse than \lcdm when $w< -1$.
Finally, we generalize the $H_0-w(z)$ degeneracy equation for $w(z)=w_0+w_1\;
z/(1+z)$ and identify analytically the full $w_0-w_1$ parameter region
(straight line) that leads to a best fit $H_0=74\; km \; sec^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}$
in the context of the Planck CMB spectrum. This exploitation of $H_0-w(z)$
degeneracy can lead to immediate identification of all parameter values of a
given $w(z)$ parametrization that can potentially resolve the $H_0$ tension.

of new infections, N/dN, in the current outbreak of COVID-19 is accurately
described by a universal function, namely the two-parameter Gumbel cumulative
function, in all countries that we have investigated. While the two Gumbel
parameters, as determined bit fits to the data, vary from country to country
(and even within different regions of the same country), reflecting the
diversity and efficacy of the adopted containment measures, the functional form
of the evolution of N/dN appears to be universal. The result of the fit in a
given region or country appears to be stable against variations of the selected
time interval. This makes it possible to robustly estimate the two parameters
from the data data even over relatively small time periods. In turn, this
allows one to predict with large advance and well-controlled confidence levels,
the time of the peak in the daily new infections, its magnitude and duration
(hence the total infections), as well as the time when the daily new infections
decrease to a pre-set value (e.g. less than about 2 new infections per day per
million people), which can be very useful for planning the reopening of
economic and social activities. We use this formalism to predict and compare
these key features of the evolution of the COVID-19 disease in a number of
countries and provide a quantitative assessment of the degree of success in in

working system design which remove this limitation, and show that the resulting

Specifically, we achieve this by decoupling a model's content from its form to
tackle architecture evolution and memory growth separately. To efficiently
handle model growth, we propose a new neuron model, called DynamicCell, drawing
inspiration from from the free energy principle [15] to introduce the concept
of reaction to discharge non-digestive energy, which also subsumes gradient
descent based approaches as its special cases. We implement DynamicCell by
introducing a new server into TensorFlow to take over most of the work
involving model growth. Consequently, it enables any existing deep learning
models to efficiently handle arbitrary number of distinct sparse features
(e.g., search queries), and grow incessantly without redefining the model. Most
notably, one of our models, which has been reliably running in production for
over a year, is capable of suggesting high quality keywords for advertisers of
Google Smart Campaigns and achieved significant accuracy gains based on a
challenging metric -- evidence that data-driven, self-evolving systems can
potentially exceed the performance of traditional rule-based approaches.

finds a spanning tree of $G$ with average stretch $O(b^2)$ with high
probability. We also describe a deterministic linear-time algorithm for
computing a spanning tree of $G$ with average stretch $O(b^3)$. For graphs of
cutwidth $c$, we construct a spanning tree with stretch $O(c^2)$ in linear
time. Finally, when $G$ has treewidth $k$ we provide a dynamic programming
algorithm computing a minimum stretch spanning tree of $G$ that runs in

principles, may be viewed as known, it is often too expensive to numerically
simulate all the interactions within the first principles description.
Therefore researchers often seek simpler descriptions that describe complex
phenomena without numerically resolving all the interacting components.
Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) arise naturally as models in this
context. The growth in data acquisition provides an opportunity for the
systematic derivation of SDE models in many disciplines. However,
inconsistencies between SDEs and real data at small time scales often cause
problems, when standard statistical methodology is applied to parameter
estimation. The incompatibility between SDEs and real data can be addressed by
deriving sufficient statistics from the time-series data and learning
parameters of SDEs based on these. Following this approach, we formulate the
fitting of SDEs to sufficient statistics from real data as an inverse problem
and demonstrate that this inverse problem can be solved by using ensemble
Kalman inversion (EKI). Furthermore, we create a framework for non-parametric
learning of drift and diffusion terms by introducing hierarchical, refineable
parameterizations of unknown functions, using Gaussian process regression. We
demonstrate the proposed methodology for the fitting of SDE models, first in a
simulation study with a noisy Lorenz 63 model, and then in other applications,
including dimension reduction starting from various deterministic chaotic
systems arising in the atmospheric sciences, large-scale pattern modeling in
climate dynamics, and simplified models for key observables arising in
molecular dynamics. The results confirm that the proposed methodology provides
a robust and systematic approach to fitting SDE models to real data.

misaligned by a supernova kick imparted to the newborn black hole. The model

the corresponding pre-supernova configurations by using standard prescriptions

evolutionary pathways involving a standard common envelope phase followed by a

is that the jet axis does not reliably trace the black hole spin axis. Our
results raise concerns about compact object merger statistics gleaned from

better fits to simulated profiles than the Einasto profile and the generalized

applied to observed rotation curves of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and

effect of baryons manifests itself in the profile parameters by a sharp drop of
the inner density slope and a 20% decrease of the concentration parameter for

$M_{\rm star}$ between $10^7$ and $10^{10}~\rm M_\odot$. The accuracy by which

  Formation Simulations","  High-redshift Lyman-alpha blobs (LABs) are an enigmatic class of objects that
have been the subject of numerous observational and theoretical investigations.
It is of particular interest to determine the dominant power sources for the
copious luminosity, as direct emission from HII regions, cooling gas, and
fluorescence due to the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can all
contribute significantly. In this paper, we present the first theoretical model
to consider all of these physical processes in an attempt to develop an
evolutionary model for the origin of high-z LABs. This is achieved by combining
a series of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations with ionization
and Lyman-alpha (Lya) radiative transfer models. We find that massive galaxies
display a range of Lya luminosities and spatial extents (which strongly depend
on the limiting surface brightness used) over the course of their lives, though
regularly exhibit luminosities and sizes consistent with observed LABs. The
model LABs are typically powered from a combination of recombination in
star-forming galaxies, as well as cooling emission from gas associated with
accretion. When AGN are included in the model, the fluorescence caused by
AGN-driven ionization can be a significant contributor to the total Lya
luminosity as well. We propose that the presence of an AGN may be predicted
from the Gini coefficient of the blob's surface brightness. Within our modeled
mass range, there are no obvious threshold physical properties that predict
appearance of LABs, and only weak correlations of the luminosity with the
physical properties of the host galaxy. This is because the emergent Lya
luminosity from a system is a complex function of the gas temperature,
ionization state, and Lya escape fraction.

immediate radiative feedback cases during reionization. For this reason, the
ionization topologies of different radiative feedback scenarios differ only on
scales smaller than $1-2$Mpc, and significant deviations are only found when
physical parameters (e.g. the escape fraction of ionizing photons) are altered

from self-similarity which is explained by a resolution dependence of the FOF
mass assignment previously reported in the literature. Evidence for convergence
is observed only starting from halos of several thousand particles, and mass
functions are overestimated by as much as 20-25 percent for halos of 50
particles. The mass function of ROCKSTAR halos, on the other hand, shows good
convergence from of order 50 to 100 particles per halo, with no detectable
evidence at the one percent level of any systematic dependence for larger
particle number. Tests show that the mass unbinding procedure in ROCKSTAR is
the key factor in obtaining this much improved resolution. Applying the same
analysis to the halo-halo two point correlation function, we find again strong
evidence for convergence only for ROCKSTAR halos, at separations sufficiently
large so that halos do not overlap. At these separations we can exclude
dependence on resolution at the few percent level once halos have of order 50
to 100 particles. At smaller separations results are not converged even at
significantly larger particle number, and bigger simulations would be required
to establish the resolution required for convergence.

clusters by tracing galaxy and gas accretion along cosmic filaments. We use
hydrodynamic simulations of volumes surrounding 324 clusters from \textsc{The
ThreeHundred} project to develop a framework for identifying and characterising
these filamentary structures, and associating galaxies with them. We define
3-dimensional reference filament networks reaching $5R_{200}$ based on the
underlying gas distribution and quantify their recovery using mock galaxy
samples mimicking observations such as those of the WEAVE Wide-Field Cluster
Survey. Since massive galaxies trace filaments, they are best recovered by
mass-weighting galaxies or imposing a bright limit (e.g. $>L^*$) on their
selection. We measure the transverse gas density profile of filaments, derive a
characteristic filament radius of $\simeq0.7$--$1~h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$, and use this
to assign galaxies to filaments. For different filament extraction methods we
find that at $R>R_{200}$, $\sim15$--$20%$ of galaxies with $M_*>3 \times 10^9
M_{\odot}$ are in filaments, increasing to $\sim60%$ for galaxies more massive
than the Milky-Way. The fraction of galaxies in filaments is independent of
cluster mass and dynamical state, and is a function of cluster-centric
distance, increasing from $\sim13$% at $5R_{200}$ to $\sim21$% at $1.5R_{200}$.
As a bridge to the design of observational studies, we measure the purity and
completeness of different filament galaxy selection strategies. Encouragingly,
the overall 3-dimensional filament networks and $\sim67$% of the galaxies
associated with them are recovered from 2-dimensional galaxy positions.

angular momentum exceeds that associated with solid-body co-rotation with the
underlying planet. In this paper, we discuss the dependence of global
super-rotation in terrestrial atmospheres on planetary rotation rate. This
dependence is revealed through analysis of global super-rotation in idealised
General Circulation Model experiments with time-independent axisymmetric
forcing, compared with estimates for global super-rotation in Solar System
atmospheres. Axisymmetric and three-dimensional experiments are conducted. We
find that the degree of global super-rotation in the three-dimensional
experiments is closely related to that of the axisymmetric experiments, with
some differences in detail. A scaling theory for global super-rotation in an
axisymmetric atmosphere is derived from the Held-Hou model. At high rotation
rate, our numerical experiments inhabit a regime where global super-rotation
scales geostrophically, and we suggest that the Earth and Mars occupy this
regime. At low rotation rate, our experiments occupy a regime determined by
angular momentum conservation, where global super-rotation is independent of
rotation rate. Global super-rotation in our experiments saturates at a value
significantly lower than that achieved in the atmospheres of Venus and Titan,
which instead occupy a regime where global super-rotation scales
cyclostrophically. This regime can only be accessed when eddy induced
up-gradient angular momentum transport is sufficiently large, which is not the
case in our idealised numerical experiments. We suggest that the 'default'
regime for a slowly rotating planet is the angular momentum conserving regime,
characterised by mild global (and local) superrotation.

is crucial to spatiotemporally forecast spatial regions and periods with an
increased risk of seeing a call to the emergency number 112. Such forecasts
allow the dispatcher to make strategic decisions to direct unoccupied
ambulances. In addition, simulations based on forecasts may serve as the
starting point for different optimal routing strategies. In this paper, we
study a unique set of Swedish spatiotemporal ambulance call data. The spatial
study region is the four northernmost regions of Sweden and the study period is
January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2018. The non-infectious disease nature of the
data motivated us to employ log-Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs) for the
spatiotemporal modelling and forecasting of the calls. To this end, we propose
a K-means based bandwidth selection method for the kernel estimation of the
spatial component of the separable spatiotemporal intensity function. The
temporal component of the intensity function is modelled by Poisson regression
and the spatiotemporal random field component of the random intensity of the
LGCP is fitted using Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm. A study of the
spatiotemporal dynamics of the data shows that a hot-spot can be found in the
southeastern part of the study region, where most people in the region live and
our fitted model captured this behaviour quite well. The fitted temporal
component of the intensity functions reveals that there is a significant
association between the expected number of calls and the day of the week as
well as the season of the year. In addition, non-parametric second-order
spatiotemporal summary statistic estimates indicate that LGCPs seem to be
reasonable models for the data. Finally, we find that the fitted forecasts
generate simulated future spatial event patterns which quite well resemble the
actual future data.

determine how to reduce energy usage. The expected energy usage of a building
can be reliably simulated using a Building Energy Model (BEM). Many of the
numerous input parameters in a BEM are uncertain. To ensure that the building
simulation is sufficiently accurate, and to better understand the impact of
imprecisions in the input parameters and calculation methods, it is desirable
to quantify uncertainty in the BEM throughout the modeling process. Uncertainty
quantification (UQ) typically requires a large number of simulations to produce
meaningful data, which, due to the vast number of input parameters and the
dynamic nature of building simulation, is computationally expensive.
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in BEM domain is thus intractable due to the
size of the problem and parameters involved and hence it needs an advanced
methodology for analysis. The current paper outlines a novel
Weakly-Connected-Systems (WCSs) identification-based UQ framework developed to
propagate the quantifiable uncertainty in the BEM. The overall approach is
demonstrated on the physics-based thermal model of an actual building in

fluids, the torques that produce turbulent vortices result from the loss of
symmetry of the stress tensor, once the viscous friction exceeds the shear
stress resistance of the fluid. In wall-bounded flows, in particular, the
turbulent vortices form in a thin layer of fluid adjacent to the wall,
practically coinciding with the so-called viscous sublayer, where the viscous
friction reaches the largest values. The present paper determines a vortex
structure for this sublayer, consistent with the well-known linearity of the
diagram of the mean streamwise velocity of this region. The analysis enables us
to calculate the diameter, angular velocity, and interaxis of the vortices in
the viscous sublayer in steady-state conditions. The lifting force that makes
the vortices migrate from the wall towards the mainstream flow is determined,
and the crucial role played by gyroscopic precession in the reorientation of

to drastically speed-up many chemical, financial, cryptographical, or
machine-learning applications. However, to capitalize on those promises,
complex design flows composed of steps such as compilation, decomposition, or
mapping need to be employed before being able to execute a conceptual quantum
algorithm on an actual device. This results in descriptions at various levels
of abstraction which may significantly differ from each other. The complexity
of the underlying design problems necessitates to not only provide efficient
solutions for the single steps, but also to verify that the originally intended
functionality is preserved throughout all levels of abstraction. This motivates
methods for equivalence checking of quantum circuits. However, most existing
methods are inspired by equivalence checking in the classical realm and have
merely been extended to support quantum circuits (which do not only rely on 0's
and 1's, but also employ superposition and entanglement).
  In this work, we propose an advanced methodology which takes the different
paradigms of quantum circuits not as a burden, but as a chance. In fact, the
proposed methodology explicitly utilizes characteristics unique to quantum
computing in order to overcome the shortcomings of existing approaches. We show
that, by exploiting the reversibility of quantum circuits, complexity can be
kept feasible in many cases. Moreover, we unveil that, in contrast to the
classical realm, simulation is very powerful in verifying quantum circuits.
Experimental evaluations confirm that the resulting methodology allows to
conduct equivalence checking drastically faster than ever before -- in many
cases just a single simulation run is sufficient. An implementation of the
proposed methodology is available at

of a mathematical energy which allows us to prove stability and well-posedness.
For single intervals and appropriately specified initial conditions, it is
well-known that the solutions of the convection-diffusion problem converge to
that of the transport problem with order $O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ in the
$L^\infty(L^2)$-norm with diffusion $\epsilon \to 0$. In this paper, we prove a
corresponding result for problems on one-dimensional networks. The main
difficulty in the analysis is that the number and type of coupling conditions
changes in the singular limit which gives rise to additional boundary layers at
the interior vertices of the network. Since the values of the solution at these

delicate choice of boundary layer functions that allows to handle these

costs, but the sampled sub-networks are not guaranteed to be estimated
precisely unless an individual training process is taken. This paper owes such

there is a random error term added to each estimation. We alleviate this issue
by training a graph convolutional network to fit the performance of sampled

strategy, we achieve a higher rank correlation coefficient in the selected set

  Learning and Neural Architecture Search","  OAR segmentation is a critical step in radiotherapy of head and neck (H&N)
cancer, where inconsistencies across radiation oncologists and prohibitive
labor costs motivate automated approaches. However, leading methods using
standard fully convolutional network workflows that are challenged when the
number of OARs becomes large, e.g. > 40. For such scenarios, insights can be
gained from the stratification approaches seen in manual clinical OAR
delineation. This is the goal of our work, where we introduce stratified organ
at risk segmentation (SOARS), an approach that stratifies OARs into anchor,
mid-level, and small & hard (S&H) categories. SOARS stratifies across two
dimensions. The first dimension is that distinct processing pipelines are used
for each OAR category. In particular, inspired by clinical practices, anchor
OARs are used to guide the mid-level and S&H categories. The second dimension
is that distinct network architectures are used to manage the significant
contrast, size, and anatomy variations between different OARs. We use
differentiable neural architecture search (NAS), allowing the network to choose
among 2D, 3D or Pseudo-3D convolutions. Extensive 4-fold cross-validation on
142 H&N cancer patients with 42 manually labeled OARs, the most comprehensive
OAR dataset to date, demonstrates that both pipeline- and NAS-stratification
significantly improves quantitative performance over the state-of-the-art (from
69.52% to 73.68% in absolute Dice scores). Thus, SOARS provides a powerful and
principled means to manage the highly complex segmentation space of OARs.

methodology for consistent evaluation of the continuum scale properties of
graphene. The scope is kept limited to elastic modulus, $E$, which has been
reported to vary between 0.912 TPa to 7 TPa, Poisson's ratio, $\nu$, which has
been reported to vary from being negative to a value as large as 0.46, and
effective thickness, $q$, whose value varies between 0.75 \AA to 3.41 \AA. Such
a large scatter arises due to inconsistent evaluation of these properties and
making assumptions that may not be valid at atomistic scales. Our methodology
combines three separate methods -- uniaxial tension, equibiaxial tension, and
flexural out-of-plane free vibrations of simply supported sheets, which, when
used in tandem in MD, can provide consistent values of $E, \nu$ and $q$. The
only assumption made in the present study is the validity of the continuum
scale thin plate vibration equation to represent the free vibrations of a long
graphene sheet. Our results suggest that -- (i) graphene is auxetic with its
Poisson's ratio increasing with increasing temperature, (ii) with increasing
temperature, $E$ decreases, and (iii) the effective thickness increases with

  management of sports records","  Individual performance metrics are commonly used to compare players from
different eras. However, such cross-era comparison is often biased due to
significant changes in success factors underlying player achievement rates
(e.g. performance enhancing drugs and modern training regimens). Such
historical comparison is more than fodder for casual discussion among sports
fans, as it is also an issue of critical importance to the multi-billion dollar
professional sport industry and the institutions (e.g. Hall of Fame) charged
with preserving sports history and the legacy of outstanding players and
achievements. To address this cultural heritage management issue, we report an
objective statistical method for renormalizing career achievement metrics, one
that is particularly tailored for common seasonal performance metrics, which
are often aggregated into summary career metrics -- despite the fact that many
player careers span different eras. Remarkably, we find that the method applied
to comprehensive Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association
player data preserves the overall functional form of the distribution of career
achievement, both at the season and career level. As such, subsequent
re-ranking of the top-50 all-time records in MLB and the NBA using renormalized
metrics indicates reordering at the local rank level, as opposed to bulk
reordering by era. This local order refinement signals time-independent
mechanisms underlying annual and career achievement in professional sports,
meaning that appropriately renormalized achievement metrics can be used to
compare players from eras with different season lengths, team strategies, rules
-- and possibly even different sports.

goal in the field of dynamic graph algorithms. While a few such algorithms are
known for spanning trees, matchings, and single-source shortest paths, very
little was known for an important primitive like graph sparsifiers. The
challenge is how to approximately preserve so much information about the graph
(e.g., all-pairs distances and all cuts) without revealing the algorithms'
underlying randomness to the adaptive adversary.
  In this paper we present the first non-trivial efficient adaptive algorithms
for maintaining spanners and cut sparisifers. These algorithms in turn imply
improvements over existing algorithms for other problems. Our first algorithm
maintains a polylog$(n)$-spanner of size $\tilde{O}(n)$ in polylog$(n)$
amortized update time. The second algorithm maintains an $O(k)$-approximate cut
sparsifier of size $\tilde{O}(n)$ in $\tilde{O}(n^{1/k})$ amortized update
time, for any $k\ge1$, which is polylog$(n)$ time when $k=\log(n)$. The
amortized update time of both algorithms can be made worst-case by paying some
sub-polynomial factors. Prior to our result, there were near-optimal algorithms
against oblivious adversaries (e.g. Baswana et al. [TALG'12] and Abraham et al.
[FOCS'16]), but the only non-trivial adaptive dynamic algorithm requires $O(n)$
amortized update time to maintain $3$- and $5$-spanner of size $O(n^{1+1/2})$
and $O(n^{1+1/3})$, respectively [Ausiello et al. ESA'05].
  Our results are based on two novel techniques. First of all, we show a
generic black-box reduction that allows us to assume that the graph undergoes
only edge deletions and, more importantly, remains an expander with
almost-uniform degree. The second is a new technique called proactive
resampling. [Abstract was shortened]

evaluated for the example of the single machine total weighted tardiness

aim is to schedule jobs on a single machine such that their total weighted

the dynamical spin and charge structure factors, and the Cu $L$-edge resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) intensity of the doped $t$-$t^\prime$-$J$

in the dynamical response functions. The inclusion of nnn hopping couples the
spinon and holon excitations, resulting in the formation of a spin-polaron,
where a ferromagnetic spin polarization cloud dresses the doped carrier. The
spin-polaron manifests itself as additional spectral weight in the dynamical
correlation functions, which appear simultaneously in the spin- and
charge-sensitive channels. We also demonstrate that RIXS can provide a unique
view of the spin-polaron, due to its sensitivity to both the spin and charge
degrees of freedom.

causes dramatic changes of atmospheric composition over China's most polluted

However, although air pollution over eastern China is at its lowest level in

  Fréchet Distance","  Approximate nearest neighbor search (\textsc{ANNS}) is a long-studied problem
in computational geometry that has received considerable attentions by
researchers in the community. In this paper, we revisit the problem in the
presence of curves under the Fr\'echet distance. Given a set ${\cal P}$ of $n$
curves of size at most $m$ each in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a real $\delta>0$, we aim
to preprocess ${\cal P}$ into a data structure so that for any given query
curve $Q$ of size $k$, report all curves in ${\cal P}$ whose Fr\'echet
distances to $Q$ are at most $\delta$. In case that $k$ is known in the
preprocessing stage we propose a fully deterministic data structure whose space
is $O(n({32d^{1/2}/\varepsilon^3})^{d(k+1)} )$ and can answer the
\textsc{$(1+\varepsilon)\delta$-ANNS} queries in $O(kd)$ query time.
Considering $k$ as part of the query slightly changes the space to $O(
n({64d^{1/2}/\varepsilon^3})^{md} )$ with $O(kd)$ query time within
$5(1+\varepsilon)$ approximation factor. We also show that our data structure
could give an alternative treatment of the approximate subtrajectory range
counting (\textsc{ASRC}) problem studied by de Berg et al.~\cite{bcg-ffq-13}.

x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of metals. The single excitations in the
problem are the plasmons and electron-hole pairs, and multi-excitation
processes are usually neglected. However, at small momentum transfer the
multi-excitation contributions may dominate the signal and one needs to
understand how to interpret the data. In particular, we demonstrate how to
''decode"" the total multi-excitation intensity and extract the plasmon
dispersion. While our calculations are based on the random phase approximation,
which does not allow to obtain quantitatively precise results in the entire

  coupling","  The paper performs simulation of a rectangular plate excited by turbulent
channel flow at friction Reynolds numbers of 180 and 400. The fluid-structure
interaction is assumed to be one-way coupled, i.e, the fluid affects the solid
and not vice versa. We solve the incompressible Navier Stokes equations using
finite volume direct numerical simulation in the fluid domain. In the solid
domain, we solve the dynamic linear elasticity equations using a time-domain
finite element method. The obtained plate averaged displacement spectra
collapse in the low frequency region in outer scaling. However, the high
frequency spectral levels do not collapse in inner units. This spectral
behavior is reasoned using theoretical arguments. We further study the sources
of plate excitation using a novel formulation. This formulation expresses the
average displacement spectra of the plate as an integrated contribution from
the fluid sources within the channel. Analysis of the net displacement source
reveals that at the plate natural frequencies, the contribution of the fluid
sources to the plate excitation peaks in the buffer layer. The corresponding
wall-normal width is found to be $\approx 0.75\delta$. We analyze the
decorrelated features of the sources using spectral Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD) of the net displacement source. We enforce the
orthogonality of the modes in an inner product with a symmetric positive
definite kernel. The dominant spectral POD mode contributes to the entire plate
excitation. The contribution of the remaining modes from the different
wall-normal regions undergo destructive interference resulting in zero net
contribution. The envelope of the dominant mode further shows that the location
and width of the contribution depend on inner and outer units, respectively.

qualities in a conversational agent. Previous work has introduced tasks and
datasets that aim to help agents to learn those qualities in isolation and
gauge how well they can express them. But rather than being specialized in one
single quality, a good open-domain conversational agent should be able to
seamlessly blend them all into one cohesive conversational flow. In this work,
we investigate several ways to combine models trained towards isolated
capabilities, ranging from simple model aggregation schemes that require
minimal additional training, to various forms of multi-task training that
encompass several skills at all training stages. We further propose a new
dataset, BlendedSkillTalk, to analyze how these capabilities would mesh
together in a natural conversation, and compare the performance of different
architectures and training schemes. Our experiments show that multi-tasking
over several tasks that focus on particular capabilities results in better
blended conversation performance compared to models trained on a single skill,
and that both unified or two-stage approaches perform well if they are
constructed to avoid unwanted bias in skill selection or are fine-tuned on our
new task.

  Abstractions","  Commutativity of data structure methods is of ongoing interest, with roots in
the database community. In recent years commutativity has been shown to be a
key ingredient to enabling multicore concurrency in contexts such as
parallelizing compilers, transactional memory, speculative execution and, more
broadly, software scalability. Despite this interest, it remains an open
question as to how a data structure's commutativity specification can be
verified automatically from its implementation.
  In this paper, we describe techniques to automatically prove the correctness
of method commutativity conditions from data structure implementations. We
introduce a new kind of abstraction that characterizes the ways in which the
effects of two methods differ depending on the order in which the methods are
applied, and abstracts away effects of methods that would be the same
regardless of the order. We then describe a novel algorithm that reduces the
problem to reachability, so that off-the-shelf program analysis tools can
perform the reasoning necessary for proving commutativity. Finally, we describe
a proof-of-concept implementation and experimental results, showing that our
tool can verify commutativity of data structures such as a memory cell,
counter, two-place Set, array-based stack, queue, and a rudimentary hash table.
We conclude with a discussion of what makes a data structure's commutativity
provable with today's tools and what needs to be done to prove more in the
future.

response time of CoFe in the BiFeO3/CoFe heterojunction is theoretically
quantified to be on to the order of 100 ps. Our results indicate that the
switching behavior of CoFe in the BiFeO3/CoFe heterojunction is dominated by
the rotation of the Neel vector in BiFeO3 rather than the unidirectional

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the switching success rate and the thermal

However, our counterexample crucially exploits the specifics of the noise

gravity minimally coupled to an odd number of massive, complex scalar fields. A
previous study assessed the stability of $\ell$-boson stars under spherical
perturbations, finding that there are both stable and unstable branches of
solutions, as for single-field boson stars ($\ell=0$). In this work we probe
the stability of $\ell$-boson stars against non-spherical perturbations by
performing numerical evolutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, with a 3D

however, evidence of zero modes; that is, non-spherical perturbations that
neither grow nor decay. This suggests the branching off towards a larger family
of equilibrium solutions: we conjecture that $\ell$-boson stars are the
enhanced isometry point of a larger family of static (and possibly stationary),

experiments. While there are innumerable calibration approaches, most can be
categorized as either `sky-based,' relying on an extremely accurate model of
astronomical foreground emission, or `redundant,' requiring a precisely regular
array with near-identical antenna response patterns. Both of these classes of
calibration are inflexible to the realities of interferometric measurement. In
practice, errors in the foreground model, antenna position offsets, and beam
response inhomogeneities degrade calibration performance and contaminate the
cosmological signal. Here we show that sky-based and redundant calibration can
be unified into a highly general and physically motivated calibration framework
based on a Bayesian statistical formalism. Our new framework includes sky and
redundant calibration as special cases but can additionally support relaxing
the rigid assumptions implicit in those approaches. Furthermore, we present
novel calibration techniques such as redundant calibration for arrays with no
redundant baselines, representing an alternative calibration method for imaging
arrays such as the MWA Phase I. These new calibration approaches could mitigate
systematics and reduce calibration error, thereby improving the precision of
cosmological measurements.

gravitational waves in the milli-Hertz frequency band. Of the tens of millions

few tens of thousand will be resolved by the future Laser Interferometer Space

analysis, and a key contribution to arriving at a global solution that
simultaneously fits for all signals in the band. Here we present an end-to-end

The method is based on the calculation of ice Ih-liquid free energy differences

interconversion is achieved by introducing a static bias potential as a
function of an order parameter. The order parameter was tailored to crystallize
the hexagonal diamond structure of oxygen in ice Ih. We study the effect of the

about the coordinates of the protons, the spontaneously formed solid

policy interventions in terms of welfare when individuals are loss-averse. The
new criterion for ""loss aversion-sensitive dominance"" defines a weak partial
ordering of the distributions of policy-induced gains and losses. It applies to
the class of welfare functions which model individual preferences with
non-decreasing and loss-averse attitudes towards changes in outcomes. We also
develop new statistical methods to test loss aversion-sensitive dominance in
practice, using nonparametric plug-in estimates. We establish the limiting
distributions of uniform test statistics by showing that they are directionally
differentiable. This implies that inference can be conducted by a special
resampling procedure. Since point-identification of the distribution of
policy-induced gains and losses may require very strong assumptions, we also
extend comparison criteria, test statistics, and resampling procedures to the
partially-identified case. Finally, we illustrate our methods with an empirical
application to welfare comparison of two income support programs.

arrays, as shown by our analysis, due to inherent limitation of the structure,
it can only track one DOA parameter and two polarisation parameters. For full
four-dimensional (4-D, 2 DOA and 2 polarization parameters) estimation, we
could extend the linear crossed-dipole array to the planar case. In this paper,
instead of extending the array geometry, we replace the crossed-dipoles by
tripoles and construct a linear tripole array. It is proved that such a
structure can estimate the 2-D DOA and 2-D polarisation information effectively
in general and a dimension-reduction based MUSIC algorithm is developed so that
the 4-D estimation problem can be simplified into two separate 2-D estimation
problems, significantly reducing the computational complexity of the solution.
The Cramr-Rao Bound (CRB) is also derived as a reference for algorithm
performance. A brief comparison between the planar crossed-dipole array and the
linear tripole array is performed at last, showing that although the planar
structure has a better performance, it is achieved at the cost of increased
physical size.

important applications. Analyzing the quality of deposited homoepitaxial layers
used in such devices is challenging, in part due to the large probing depth in
traditional x-ray diffraction (XRD) and also due to the surface-sensitive
nature of atomic force microscopy (AFM). Here, a combination of evanescent

to effectively characterize the quality of homoepitaxial $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$

Accounting for both structure and morphology, optimal films are achieved at a
Ga/O ratio of $\sim$1.15, a conclusion that would not be possible to achieve by
either XRD or AFM methods alone. Finally, fabricated Schottky barrier diodes
with thicker homoepitaxial layers are characterized by $J-V$ and $C-V$

nucleon-nucleon (NN) and three-nucleon (3N) interactions from chiral effective
field theory (EFT) can provide a predictive description of low-energy
light-nuclei reactions relevant for astrophysics and fusion-energy
applications. However, the high cost of computations has so far impeded a
complete analysis of the uncertainty budget of such calculations. Purpose:
Starting from NN potentials up to fifth order (N4LO) combined with
leading-order 3N forces, we study how the order-by-order convergence of the
chiral expansion and confidence intervals for the 3N contact and
contact-plus-one-pion-exchange low-energy constants (cE and cD) contribute to
the overall uncertainty budget of many-body calculations of neutron-He elastic
scattering. Methods: We compute structure and reaction observables for three-,
four- and five-nucleon systems within the ab initio frameworks of the no-core
shell model an no-core shell model with continuum. Using a small set of design
runs, we construct a Gaussian process model (GPM) that acts as a statistical
emulator for the theory. With this, we gain insight into how uncertainties in
the 3N low-energy constants propagate throughout the calculation and determine
the Bayesian posterior distribution of these parameters with Markov-Chain
Monte-Carlo.

assembly of Milky Way-mass ( $M_{\mathrm{vir}} \approx 7 \times 10^{11}$
$M_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$) galaxies in cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting
dark matter (SIDM) models. Our SIDM model adopts a constant cross-section of 1
cm$^2$/g. We find that SMBH formation is suppressed in the early universe due
to SIDM coring. SMBH-SMBH mergers are also suppressed in SIDM as a consequence
of the lower number of SMBHs formed. Lack of initial merger-driven SMBH growth
in turn delays SMBH growth by billions of years in SIDM compared to CDM.
Further, we find that this delayed growth suppresses SMBH accretion in the
largest progenitors of the main SIDM galaxies during the first 5 Gyrs of their
evolution. Nonetheless, by $z = 0.8$ the CDM and SIDM SMBH masses differ only
by around 0.2 dex, so that both remain compatible with the $M_{BH}-M_{*}$
relation. We show that the reduced accretion causes the SIDM SMBHs to less
aggressively regulate star formation in their host galaxies than their CDM
counterparts, resulting in a factor of 3 or more stars being produced over the
lifetime of the SIDM galaxies compared to the CDM galaxies. Our results
highlight a new way in which SIDM can affect the growth and merger history of
SMBHs and ultimately give rise to very different galaxy evolution compared to
the classic CDM model.

couples fluid and particle momentum depends on the undisturbed fluid velocity
at the particle location, and this latter quantity requires modelling. We
demonstrate that the undisturbed fluid velocity, in the low particle Reynolds
number limit, can be related exactly to the discrete Green's function of the
discrete Stokes equations. The method is general in that it can be extended to
other partial differential equations which may be associated with
particle-laden flows, such as the thermal energy equation or Maxwell's
equations. In this work, we demonstrate the method of discrete Green's
functions by obtaining these functions for the Navier-Stokes equations at low
particle Reynolds number in a two-plane channel geometry. We perform
verification at low and finite particle Reynolds number for the case of a
point-particle settling under gravity parallel to a plane wall, for different
wall normal separations. In comparing to other point-particle schemes the
discrete Green's function approach is the most robust at low particle Reynolds
number, accurate at all wall-normal separations and is the most accurate in the
near wall region at finite Reynolds number. We discuss how the accuracy away
from the wall at finite Reynolds number could be improved by appealing to
Oseen-like discrete Green's functions. Finally we demonstrate that the discrete
Green's function approach can have important implications on statistics of

ultralight axion simulations. Based on LPT, our modified scheme is extremely
efficient on large scales and it can be extended to an arbitrary number of
particle species at very little computational cost. This allows for computation
of self-consistent initial conditions in mixed dark matter models.
Additionally, we find that shell-crossing is delayed for ultralight particles
and that the deformation tensor extracted from LPT can be used to identify the
range of redshifts and scales for which the Madelung formalism of fuzzy dark
matter is a reliable approximation.

this paper, we present a new family of Transformer models, which we call the
Extended Transformer Construction (ETC), that allows for significant increases

amounts of data by distributing processing across connected devices. Two key
challenges to achieving this goal are heterogeneity in devices compute
resources and topology constraints on which devices can communicate with each
other. We address these challenges by developing the first network-aware
distributed learning optimization methodology where devices optimally share
local data processing and send their learnt parameters to a server for
aggregation at certain time intervals. Unlike traditional federated learning
frameworks, our method enables devices to offload their data processing tasks
to each other, with these decisions determined through a convex data transfer
optimization problem that trades off costs associated with devices processing,
offloading, and discarding data points. We analytically characterize the
optimal data transfer solution for different fog network topologies, showing
for example that the value of offloading is approximately linear in the range
of computing costs in the network. Our subsequent experiments on testbed
datasets we collect confirm that our algorithms are able to improve network
resource utilization substantially without sacrificing the accuracy of the
learned model. In these experiments, we also study the effect of network
dynamics, quantifying the impact of nodes entering or exiting the network on
model learning and resource costs.

multi-stage decision-making problems affected by uncertainty. Most approaches
assume that the uncertain parameters can be observed for free and that the
sequence in which they are revealed is independent of the decision-maker's
actions. Yet, these assumptions fail to hold in many real-world applications
where the time of information discovery is decision-dependent and the uncertain
parameters only become observable after an often costly investment. To fill
this gap, we consider two- and multi-stage robust optimization problems in
which part of the decision variables control the time of information discovery.
Thus, information available at any given time is decision-dependent and can be
discovered (at least in part) by making strategic exploratory investments in
previous stages. We propose a novel dynamic formulation of the problem and
prove its correctness. We leverage our model to provide a solution method
inspired from the K-adaptability approximation, whereby K candidate strategies
for each decision stage are chosen here-and-now and, at the beginning of each
period, the best of these strategies is selected after the uncertain parameters
that were chosen to be observed are revealed. We reformulate the problem as a
finite program solvable with off-the-shelf solvers. We generalize our approach
to the minimization of piecewise linear convex functions. We demonstrate
effectiveness of our approach on synthetic and real data instances of the
active preference elicitation problem used to recommend policies that meet the
needs of policy-makers at the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. We
present several other problems of practical interest to which our approaches

to ResNet, our proposed adaptive complex mapping results in a shallower network
with less numbers of training parameters and floating point operations per

improves fitting and training the network and hence recognizing subtle facial

Our experimental results show that our adaptive complex mapping approach
outperforms the original ResNet consisting of a simple identity mapping as well
as other state-of-the-art methods for Facial Expression Recognition (FER).
Various metrics are reported in both affect models to provide a comprehensive
evaluation of our method. In the categorical model, BReG-NeXt-50 with only 3.1M
training parameters and 15 MFLOPs, achieves 68.50% and 71.53% accuracy on

prove the LSTM is not rational, which formally separates it from the related
QRNN (Bradbury et al., 2016). We also show how these models' expressive
capacity is expanded by stacking multiple layers or composing them with
different pooling functions. Our results build on the theory of ""saturated""

Ages are estimated by using both the minimum luminosity red supergiant and the
mean luminosity of red supergiants in a cluster. We test these methods on a
number of observed star clusters and find our results in agreement with
previous estimates. Importantly we find the difference between the ages derived
from stellar population models with and without a realistic population of
interacting binary stars is only a few 100,000 years at most. We find that the
mean luminosity of red supergiants in a cluster is the best method to determine
the age of a cluster because it is based o the entire red supergiant population

  wormholes","  The problem of the electrostatics in conical wormholes is revisited, now
improving the background geometries with asymptotical flatness. The electric
self-force on a point charge placed at different regions in the spacetime of a
conical thin-shell wormhole connecting flat outer submanifolds is obtained and
compared with the results of previous works. The study is also carried out in
terms of a previously introduced analogy in which the effect of the matter
shells on the electric field is reproduced by non-gravitating layers of charge
located on the boundary surfaces. Besides, a better insight on the physical
effects of a non trivial topology is obtained by means of a further analysis of
the electric fluxes across the wormhole throat and at both spatial infinities.
It is found that the throat is traversed by a non-arbitrary and finite
topological flux, proportional to the charge of the source, which is
characteristic of the asymptotically flat cylindrical wormholes regardless of
the details of the throat geometry.

  by Terathanasia","  We investigate the causal effects of drug exposure on birth defects,
motivated by a recent cohort study of birth outcomes in pregnancies of women
treated with a given medication, that revealed a higher rate of major
structural birth defects in infants born to exposed versus unexposed women. An
outstanding problem in this study was the missing birth defect outcomes among
pregnancy losses resulting from spontaneous abortion. This led to missing not
at random because, according to the theory of ""terathanasia"", a defected fetus
is more likely to be spontaneously aborted. In addition, the previous analysis
stratified on live birth against spontaneous abortion, which was itself a
post-exposure variable and hence did not lead to causal interpretation of the
stratified results. In this paper we aimed to estimate and provide inference
for the causal parameters of scientific interest, including the principal
effects, making use of the missing data mechanism informed by terathanasia.
During this process we also dealt with complications in the data including left
truncation, observational nature, and rare events. We report our findings which
shed light on how studies on causal effects of medication or other exposures

a set of keyphrases. A new setting is recently introduced into this problem, in
which, given a document, the model needs to predict a set of keyphrases and
simultaneously determine the appropriate number of keyphrases to produce.
Previous work in this setting employs a sequential decoding process to generate
keyphrases. However, such a decoding method ignores the intrinsic hierarchical
compositionality existing in the keyphrase set of a document. Moreover,
previous work tends to generate duplicated keyphrases, which wastes time and
computing resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose an exclusive
hierarchical decoding framework that includes a hierarchical decoding process
and either a soft or a hard exclusion mechanism. The hierarchical decoding
process is to explicitly model the hierarchical compositionality of a keyphrase
set. Both the soft and the hard exclusion mechanisms keep track of
previously-predicted keyphrases within a window size to enhance the diversity
of the generated keyphrases. Extensive experiments on multiple KG benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to generate less
duplicated and more accurate keyphrases.

  Rig","  Super Resolution is the problem of recovering a high-resolution image from a
single or multiple low-resolution images of the same scene. It is an ill-posed
problem since high frequency visual details of the scene are completely lost in
low-resolution images. To overcome this, many machine learning approaches have
been proposed aiming at training a model to recover the lost details in the new
scenes. Such approaches include the recent successful effort in utilizing deep
learning techniques to solve super resolution problem. As proven, data itself
plays a significant role in the machine learning process especially deep
learning approaches which are data hungry. Therefore, to solve the problem, the
process of gathering data and its formation could be equally as vital as the
machine learning technique used. Herein, we are proposing a new data
acquisition technique for gathering real image data set which could be used as
an input for super resolution, noise cancellation and quality enhancement
techniques. We use a beam-splitter to capture the same scene by a low
resolution camera and a high resolution camera. Since we also release the raw
images, this large-scale dataset could be used for other tasks such as ISP
generation. Unlike current small-scale dataset used for these tasks, our
proposed dataset includes 11,421 pairs of low-resolution high-resolution images
of diverse scenes. To our knowledge this is the most complete dataset for super
resolution, ISP and image quality enhancement. The benchmarking result shows
how the new dataset can be successfully used to significantly improve the

semantic segmentation. The major challenge of this task lies in how to exploit
unlabeled data efficiently and thoroughly. Previous state-of-the-art methods
utilize unlabeled data by GAN-based self-training or consistency
regularization. However, these methods either suffer from noisy
self-supervision and class-imbalance, resulting in a low unlabeled data
utilization rate, or do not consider the apparent link between self-training
and consistency regularization. Our method, Dynamic Self-Training and
Class-Balanced Curriculum (DST-CBC), exploits inter-model disagreement by
prediction confidence to construct a dynamic loss robust against pseudo label
noise, enabling it to extend pseudo labeling to a class-balanced curriculum
learning process. While we further show that our method implicitly includes
consistency regularization. Thus, DST-CBC not only exploits unlabeled data
efficiently, but also thoroughly utilizes $all$ unlabeled data. Without using
adversarial training or any kind of modification to the network architecture,
DST-CBC outperforms existing methods on different datasets across all labeled
ratios, bringing semi-supervised learning yet another step closer to match the
performance of fully-supervised learning for semantic segmentation. Our code

networks for feature extraction from each. Such schemes can easily be
constrained by a limited amount of training data or over-reliance on an

RGB and depth inputs through a Siamese network. To this end, we propose two
effective components: joint learning (JL), and densely-cooperative fusion
(DCF). The JL module provides robust saliency feature learning, while the
latter is introduced for complementary feature discovery. Comprehensive
experiments on four popular metrics show that the designed framework yields a
robust RGB-D saliency detector with good generalization. As a result, JL-DCF
significantly advances the top-1 D3Net model by an average of ~1.9% (S-measure)
across six challenging datasets, showing that the proposed framework offers a
potential solution for real-world applications and could provide more insight
into the cross-modality complementarity task. The code will be available at

various satellites based observations with increasing experimental accuracies
there has been a parallel increase in the demand for a CMB reconstruction
technique which can provide accurate estimates of CMB signal and the
theoretical angular power spectrum along with reliable statistical error
estimates associated with them. In this work, we estimate the joint posterior
of CMB E mode signal (S) and corresponding theoretical angular power spectrum
(C^E_l) over large angular scales given the simulated polarization observations
of future generation COrE satellite mission. To generate samples from the joint
distribution we employ the ILC technique with prior information of CMB E mode
covariance matrix augmented by a Gibbs sampling technique. We estimate the
marginalized densities of S and C^E_l using the samples from full-posterior.
The best fit cleaned E mode map and the corresponding angular power spectrum
agree well with the input E mode map and the sky power spectrum implying
accurate reconstruction using COrE like observations. Using the samples C^E_l
of all Gibbs chains we estimate the likelihood function P(C^E_l|D) of any
arbitrary C^E_l given simulated observed maps (D) of COrE mission following
Blackwell-Rao estimator. The likelihood function can be seamlessly integrated
to the cosmological parameter estimation method. Apart from producing an
accurate estimate of E mode signal over large angular scales our method also
builds a connection between the component reconstruction and reliable
cosmological parameter estimation using CMB E mode observations over large
angular scales. The entire method does not assume any explicit models for E
mode foreground components in order to remove them, which is an attractive
property since foreground modelling uncertainty does not pose as a challenge in
this case.

  Large-Scale Building Extraction using Airborne LiDAR Data and Optical Image","  Automatic extraction of buildings in urban and residential scenes has become
a subject of growing interest in the domain of photogrammetry and remote
sensing, particularly since mid-1990s. Active contour model, colloquially known
as snake model, has been studied to extract buildings from aerial and satellite
imagery. However, this task is still very challenging due to the complexity of
building size, shape, and its surrounding environment. This complexity leads to
a major obstacle for carrying out a reliable large-scale building extraction,
since the involved prior information and assumptions on building such as shape,
size, and color cannot be generalized over large areas. This paper presents an
efficient snake model to overcome such challenge, called Super-Resolution-based
Snake Model (SRSM). The SRSM operates on high-resolution LiDAR-based elevation
images -- called z-images -- generated by a super-resolution process applied to
LiDAR data. The involved balloon force model is also improved to shrink or
inflate adaptively, instead of inflating the snake continuously. This method is
applicable for a large scale such as city scale and even larger, while having a
high level of automation and not requiring any prior knowledge nor training
data from the urban scenes (hence unsupervised). It achieves high overall
accuracy when tested on various datasets. For instance, the proposed SRSM
yields an average area-based Quality of 86.57% and object-based Quality of
81.60% on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark datasets. Compared to other methods
using this benchmark dataset, this level of accuracy is highly desirable even
for a supervised method. Similarly desirable outcomes are obtained when
carrying out the proposed SRSM on the whole City of Quebec (total area of 656
km2), yielding an area-based Quality of 62.37% and an object-based Quality of
63.21%.

works rely on certain strict assumptions such as knowing the opponent's private
behaviors, which might not be practical. In this work, we focused on two Nobel
winning concepts, the Nash equilibrium and the correlated equilibrium.
Specifically, we successfully reached the correlated equilibrium outside the
convex hull of the Nash equilibria with our proposed deep reinforcement
learning algorithm. With the correlated equilibrium probability distribution,
we also propose a mathematical model to inverse the calculation of the
correlated equilibrium probability distribution to estimate the opponent's
payoff vector. With those payoffs, deep reinforcement learning learns why and
how the rational opponent plays, instead of just learning the regions for
corresponding strategies and actions. Through simulations, we showed that our

expanding in science domains that were previously not compute intensive. When
compute workflows spike well in excess of the capacity of their local compute
resource, capacity should be temporarily provisioned from somewhere else to
both meet deadlines and to increase scientific output. Public Clouds have
become an attractive option due to their ability to be provisioned with minimal
advance notice. The available capacity of cost-effective instances is not well
understood. This paper presents expanding the IceCube's production HTCondor
pool using cost-effective GPU instances in preemptible mode gathered from the
three major Cloud providers, namely Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and
the Google Cloud Platform. Using this setup, we sustained for a whole workday
about 15k GPUs, corresponding to around 170 PFLOP32s, integrating over one
EFLOP32 hour worth of science output for a price tag of about $60k. In this
paper, we provide the reasoning behind Cloud instance selection, a description
of the setup and an analysis of the provisioned resources, as well as a short
description of the actual science output of the exercise.

and its color. For instance, the word, ""hot"", is often printed in red, while
""cold"" is often in blue. This correlation can be thought of as a feature that
represents the semantic difference between the words. Based on this
observation, we propose the idea of using text color for word embeddings. While
text-only word embeddings (e.g. word2vec) have been extremely successful, they
often represent antonyms as similar since they are often interchangeable in
sentences. In this paper, we try two tasks to verify the usefulness of text
color in understanding the meanings of words, especially in identifying
synonyms and antonyms. First, we quantify the color distribution of words from
the book cover images and analyze the correlation between the color and meaning
of the word. Second, we try to retrain word embeddings with the color
distribution of words as a constraint. By observing the changes in the word
embeddings of synonyms and antonyms before and after re-training, we aim to
understand the kind of words that have positive or negative effects in their
word embeddings when incorporating text color information.

  Machine Learning","  Ferroelectric materials have reversible spontaneous electric polarization,
which are usually believed to be nonconducting because conduction electrons
would screen out the static internal electric fields and preclude intrinsic
polarization. In 1965, Anderson and Blount proposed the concept of
ferroelectric metal, however, it is only until recently that a few
ferroelectric metals were reported. Here, by combining high-throughput ab
initio calculations and a data-driven machine learning model with new
descriptors related to electronic orbitals, we systematically investigated a
large family (2,964) of two-dimensional (2D) bimetal phosphates, and discovered
60 novel stable ferroelectric materials, including 16 ferroelectric metals with
out-of-plane electric polarization and 44 ferroelectric semiconductors that
contain seven multiferroics with two or three type of ferroic orderings and
seven ferroelectric water-splitting photocatalysts. The origin of
ferroelectricity in these 2D metals is owing to the spontaneous inversion
symmetry breaking induced by the vertical displacement of bimetal atoms, where
the electric polarization and spatial displacement are unveiled to obey a
quadratic law. Charge analysis reveals that conducting electrons are mainly
located only one surface and are spatially separated from the
ferroelectric-paraelectric charge difference and atom displacement related to
polarization, thus giving rise to the coexistence of ferroelectricity and
metallicity, which also shows the dimensional effect plays a vital role in 2D
metallic ferroelectricity. These ferroelectric metals would have potential uses
in areas of nonvolatile field-effect transistors, programmable electronic
devices, and tunable surface plasmon polariton devices.

idea of \emph{check node (CN) doping} of regular SC-LDPC codes, here we employ
variable node (VN) doping to fix (set to a known value) a subset of variable
nodes in the coupling chain. Both of these doping methods have the effect of
allowing SWD to recover from error propagation, at a cost of a slight rate
loss. Experimental results show that, similar to CN doping, VN doping improves
performance by up to two orders of magnitude compared to undoped SC-LDPC codes
in the typical signal-to-noise ratio operating range. Further, compared to CN
doping, VN doping has the advantage of not requiring any changes to the
decoding process.In addition, a log-likelihood-ratio based window extension
algorithm is proposed to reduce the effect of error propagation. Using this
approach, we show that decoding latency can be reduced by up to a significant
fraction without suffering any loss in performance.

are the regions on the boundary between open space and unexplored space. A
mobile robot is able to construct its map by adding new space and moving to
unvisited frontiers until the entire environment has been explored. The
existing exploration methods suffer from low exploration efficiency in complex

from Cyg X-3, the other three sources have large accretion disks, and there is
evidence of a high orbital inclination. Therefore, any large scale geometrical
change in the accretion disk can cause local obscuration events. On the other
hand, Cyg X-3 orbits its Wolf-Rayet companion star inside the heavy stellar
wind obscuring the X-ray source. We study here whether the peculiar X-ray
spectra observed from all four sources can be explained by local obscuration
events. We fit the source spectra with two physically motivated models
describing either a scenario where all the intrinsic emission is reprocessed in
the surrounding matter or where the emitter is surrounded by a thick torus with
variable opening angle. We show that the X-ray spectra during specific times
are similar in all four sources likely arising from the high-density
environments where they are embedded. The fitted models suggest that a
low-luminosity phase preceding an intense flaring episode in the 2015 outburst
of V404 Cyg is heavily obscured, but intrinsically very bright
(super-Eddington) accretion state. Similar spectral evolution to that of V404
Cyg is observed from the recent, unusually low-luminosity state of GRS
1915+105. The modeling results point to a geometry change in the (outflowing)
obscuring matter in V404 Cyg and GRS 1915+105, which is also linked to the
radio (jet) evolution. All sources display obscured X-ray emission but with
different intrinsic luminosities which points towards different factors causing
the obscuration. This work highlights the importance of taking into account the
reprocessing of the X-ray emission in the surrounding medium in the modeling of
the X-ray spectra that may well take place in other sources as well.

oscillations can be used for solar cycle prediction. We consider two types of
dynamo models: models with regular variations of the alpha-effect, and models
with stochastic variations. The regular dynamo models show the two different
relationships for the growing and decaying stages of the magnetic cycle
variations on centennial time scales. For the dynamo models with fluctuations,
these relations are merged. We find that for both types of models the amplitude
of solar cycles correlates well with the integral amplitude of the zonal
harmonic $\ell=9$ of the torsional acceleration waves of the preceding cycles
in subsurface layers and with the $\ell=3$ harmonic at the bottom of the
convection zone. While these relationships are weaker than the previously known
relationship of the cycle magnitude with the poloidal field in the preceding
minima, the prediction horizon of the torsional oscillations is greater and may
reach the full 11-year activity cycle. In addition, we find that the amplitude
of the asymmetric about the equator components of the torsional oscillations
can be used as a precursor in forecasts of the hemispheric asymmetry of
magnetic activity.

improves the average success rate of NISQ applications by 1.47X. Surprisingly,
the additional gates for uncomputation create ancilla with better locality, and

  Segmentation Method","  The Computer-Assisted Diagnosis systems could save workloads and give
objective diagnostic to ophthalmologists. At first, feature extraction is a
fundamental step. One of these retinal features is the fovea. The fovea is a
small fossa on the fundus. The main vessels diverge from the optic nerve head
and follow a specific course that can be geometrically modeled as a parabola,
with a common vertex inside the optic nerve head and the fovea located along
the apex of this parabola curve. Therefore, based on this assumption, the main
retinal blood vessels are segmented and fitted to a parabolic model. With
respect to the core vascular structure, we can thus detect fovea in the fundus
images. For the vessel segmentation, our algorithm addresses the image locally
where homogeneity of features is more likely to occur. The algorithm is
composed of 4 steps: multi-overlapping windows, local Radon transform, vessel
validation, and parabolic fitting. In order to extract blood vessels,
sub-vessels should be extracted in local windows. The high contrast between
blood vessels and image background in the images cause the vessels to be
associated with peaks in the Radon space. The largest vessels, using a high
threshold of the Radon transform, determine the main course or overall
configuration of the blood vessels which when fitted to a parabola, leads to
the future localization of the fovea. In effect, with an accurate fit, the
fovea normally lies along the slope joining the vertex and the focus. The
darkest region along this line is indicative of the fovea. To evaluate our
method, we used 220 fundus images from a rural database (MUMS-DB) and one
public one (DRIVE). The results show that among 20 images of the first public
database (DRIVE) we detected fovea in 85\% of them. Also for the MUMS-DB
database among 200 images, we detect fovea correctly in 83% on them.

captured by the image sensor (colour filter array) that appear after

high frequency content. The Moire pattern can also vary intensely due to a
minimal change in the camera direction/positioning. Thus the Moire pattern
depreciates the quality of photographs. An important issue in demoireing
pattern is that the Moireing patterns have dynamic structure with varying
colors and forms. These challenges makes the demoireing more difficult than
many other image restoration tasks. Inspired by these challenges in demoireing,
a multilevel hyper vision net is proposed to remove the Moire pattern to
improve the quality of the images. As a key aspect, in this network we involved
residual channel attention block that can be used to extract and adaptively

in interferometry and pulsar modes, and compare the results with its already

find that the results obtained from interferometry and pulsar modes of the

with the uGMRT match with that obtained by the Lovell telescope, Stokes $Q$ and
$V$ do not. This can be explained if the $X$ and $Y$ dipoles in this band, from
which $R$ and $L$ are derived, are swapped w.r.t. the IAU convention. The
swapping makes $RR^*$ and $LL^*$ of the uGMRT band 4 to be $LL^*$ and $RR^*$
respectively according to the IEEE convention. This implies that if we need to
compare polarization measurements obtained in band 4 of the uGMRT with
telescopes like Lovell, Parkes, Very Large Array etc. (all follow IEEE

interchange $RR^*$ and $LL^*$, and change the sign of Stokes $Q$ for the uGMRT

to change in future once the swapping of the dipoles is taken care of. Once it

theory, which admits exact solutions for physical type of the potentials. Our
consideration deals with cosmological inflationary models based on GSTG with
non-minimal coupling of a (non-canonical) scalar field to the Ricci scalar. The
basis of proposed approach to the analysis of these models is a priori
specified relation between the Hubble parameter $H$ and a function of
non-minimal coupling $F=1+\delta F$ as $H\propto\sqrt{F}$. Deviations from
Einstein gravity $\delta F$ induce a corresponding deviations of the potential
$\delta V$ from a constant value and modify the dynamics from pure de Sitter
exponential expansion. We analyze the models with exponential power-law
evolution of the scale factor and we find the equations of influence of
non-minimal coupling, choosing it in the special form, on the potential and
kinetic energies. Such consideration allows us to substitute the physical
potential into obtained equations and then to calculate the non-minimal
coupling function and kinetic term that are define GSTG parameters. With this
method, we reconstruct GSTG for polynomial, exponential, Higgs,
Higgs-Starobinsky and Coleman-Weinberg potentials. Special attention we pay to
parameters of cosmological perturbations and prove correspondence obtained

simple reason that there is no kernel designed to represent them and their
unique characteristics in full generality. Existing sequential kernels ignore
the time indices, with many assuming that the series must be regularly-spaced;
some such kernels are not even psd. In this manuscript, we show that a ""series
kernel"" that is general enough to represent irregularly-spaced multivariate
time series may be built out of well-known ""vector kernels"". We also show that
all series kernels constructed using our methodology are psd, and are thus
widely applicable. We demonstrate this point by formulating a Gaussian
process-based strategy - with our series kernel at its heart - to make
predictions about test series when given a training set. We validate the
strategy experimentally by estimating its generalisation error on multiple
datasets and comparing it to relevant baselines. We also demonstrate that our
series kernel may be used for the more traditional setting of time series
classification, where its performance is broadly in line with alternative
methods.

Satisfactory visual segments cannot be obtained using FCM. Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) belongs to the class of evolutionary algorithms and has good
convergence speed and fewer parameters compared to Genetic Algorithms (GAs). An
optimized version of PSO can be combined with FCM to act as a proper
initializer for the algorithm thereby reducing its sensitivity to initial
guess. A hybrid PSO algorithm named Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO)
which improves in the calculation of various hyper parameters like inertia
weight, learning factors over standard PSO, using insights from swarm
behaviour, leading to improvement in cluster quality can be used. This paper
presents a new image segmentation algorithm called Adaptive Particle Swarm
Optimization and Fuzzy C-means Clustering Algorithm (APSOF), which is based on
Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) and Fuzzy C-means clustering.
Experimental results show that APSOF algorithm has edge over FCM in correctly
identifying the optimum cluster centers, there by leading to accurate
classification of the image pixels. Hence, APSOF algorithm has superior
performance in comparison with classic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and
Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FCM) for image segmentation.

Many existing researches compromise this difficulty to generate hazy images by
rendering the haze from depth on common RGBD datasets using the haze imaging

depth maps for outdoor are imprecise. In this paper, we complement the exiting
datasets with a new, large, and diverse dehazing dataset containing real

  model","  This paper studies the asymptotic behavior of coexistence steady states of
the Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto model as both cross-diffusion coefficients tend
to infinity at the same rate. In the case when either one of two
cross-diffusion coefficients tends to infinity, Lou and Ni (1999) derived a
couple of limiting systems, which characterize the asymptotic behavior of
coexistence steady states. Recently, a formal observation by Kan-on (2020)
implied the existence of a limiting system including the nonstationary problem
as both cross-diffusion coefficients tend to infinity at the same rate. This
paper gives a rigorous proof of his observation as far as the stationary
problem. As a key ingredient of the proof, we establish a uniform $L^{\infty}$
estimate for all steady states. Thanks to this a priori estimate, we show that
the asymptotic profile of coexistence steady states can be characterized by a
solution of either of two limiting systems.

the mobile community. Albeit Google Play recently introduced some privacy
guidelines, it is still an open problem to soundly verify whether apps actually
comply with such rules. To this aim, in this paper, we discuss a novel
methodology based on a fruitful combination of static analysis, dynamic
analysis, and machine learning techniques, which allows assessing such
compliance. More in detail, our methodology checks whether each app i) contains
a privacy policy that complies with the Google Play privacy guidelines, and ii)
accesses privacy-sensitive information only upon the acceptance of the policy
by the user. Furthermore, the methodology also allows checking the compliance
of third-party libraries embedded in the apps w.r.t. the same privacy
guidelines. We implemented our methodology in a tool, 3PDroid, and we carried
out an assessment on a set of recent and most-downloaded Android apps in the
Google Play Store. Experimental results suggest that more than 95% of apps
access user's privacy-sensitive information, but just a negligible subset of
them (around 1%) fully complies with the Google Play privacy guidelines.

  from Planck data","  We measure the 850-$\mu$m source densities of 46 candidate protoclusters
selected from the Planck High-z catalogue (PHz) and the Planck Catalogue of
Compact Sources (PCCS) that were followed up with Herschel-SPIRE and SCUBA-2.
This paper aims to search for overdensities of 850-$\mu$m sources in order to
select the fields that are most likely to be genuine protoclusters. Of the 46
candidate protoclusters, 25 have significant overdensities ($>$5 times the
field counts), 11 have intermediate overdensities (3--5 times the field counts)
and 10 have no overdensity ($<$3 times the field counts) of 850-$\mu$m sources.
We find that the enhanced number densities are unlikely to be the result of
sample variance. Compared with the number counts of another sample selected
from Planck's compact source catalogues, this [PHz+PCCS]-selected sample has a
higher fraction of candidate protoclusters with significant overdensities,
though both samples show overdensities of 850-$\mu$m sources above intermediate
level. Based on the estimated star-formation rate densities (SFRDs), we suggest
that both samples can efficiently select protoclusters with starbursting
galaxies near the redshift at which the global field SFRD peaks ($2 < z < 3$).
Based on the confirmation of overdensities found here, future follow-up
observations on other PHz targets may greatly increase the number of genuine
DSFG-rich clusters/protoclusters.

efficiency of silicon-based solar cells through singlet exciton fission (SF).
We elucidated the structure of the first monolayers of tetracene (Tc), a SF
molecule, on hydrogen-passivated Si(111) [H-Si(111)] and hydrogenated amorphous
Si (a-Si:H) by combining near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments with density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. For samples grown at or below substrate temperatures
of 265 K, the resulting ultrathin Tc films are dominated by almost
upright-standing molecules. The molecular arrangement is very similar to the Tc
bulk phase, with only slightly higher average angle between the conjugated
molecular plane normal and the surface normal ($\alpha$) around 77{\deg}.
Judging from carbon K-edge X-ray absorption spectra, the orientation of the Tc
molecules are almost identical when grown on H-Si(111) and a-Si:H substrates as
well as for (sub)mono- to several-monolayer coverages. Annealing to room
temperature, however, changes the film structure towards a smaller $\alpha$ of
about 63{\deg}. A detailed DFT-assisted analysis suggests that this structural
transition is correlated with a lower packing density and requires a
well-chosen amount of thermal energy. Therefore, we attribute the resulting
structure to a distinct monolayer configuration that features less inclined,
but still well-ordered molecules. The larger overlap with the substrate
wavefunctions makes this arrangement attractive for an optimized interfacial
electron transfer in SF-assisted silicon solar cells.

Solidity is one of the most popular programming languages for writing smart
contracts on the Ethereum platform. Like traditional programs, smart contracts
may contain vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional programs, smart contracts
cannot be easily patched once they are deployed. It is thus important that
smart contracts are tested thoroughly before deployment. In this work, we
present an adaptive fuzzer for smart contracts on the Ethereum platform called
sFuzz. Compared to existing Solidity fuzzers, sFuzz combines the strategy in
the AFL fuzzer and an efficient lightweight multi-objective adaptive strategy
targeting those hard-to-cover branches. sFuzz has been applied to more than 4
thousand smart contracts and the experimental results show that (1) sFuzz is
efficient, e.g., two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tools;
(2) sFuzz is effective in achieving high code coverage and discovering
vulnerabilities; and (3) the different fuzzing strategies in sFuzz complement

  Information","  Today many mobile users in various zones are invited to sense and send back
real-time useful information (e.g., traffic observation and sensor data) to
keep the freshness of the content updates in such zones. However, due to the
sampling cost in sensing and transmission, a user may not have the incentive to
contribute the real-time information to help reduce the age of information
(AoI). We propose dynamic pricing for each zone to offer age-dependent monetary
returns and encourage users to sample information at different rates over time.
This dynamic pricing design problem needs to well balance the monetary payments
as rewards to users and the AoI evolution over time, and is challenging to
solve especially under the incomplete information about users' arrivals and
their private sampling costs. After formulating the problem as a nonlinear
constrained dynamic program, to avoid the curse of dimensionality, we first
propose to approximate the dynamic AoI reduction as a time-average term and
successfully solve the approximate dynamic pricing in closed-form. Further, by
providing the steady-state analysis for an infinite time horizon, we show that
the pricing scheme (though in closed-form) can be further simplified to an
$\varepsilon$-optimal version without recursive computing over time. Finally,
we extend the AoI control from a single zone to many zones with heterogeneous
user arrival rates and initial ages, where each zone cares not only its own AoI
dynamics but also the average AoI of all the zones in a mean field game system
to provide a holistic service. Accordingly, we propose decentralized mean field
pricing for each zone to self-operate by using a mean field term to estimate
the average age dynamics of all the zones, which does not even require many
zones to exchange their local data with each other.

state. We found that the optical irradiation with circular or linear
polarization could induce topological phase transition into quantum Anomalous
Hall (QAH) phase with varying winding number or semi-metal (SM) phase with a
pair of two Dirac cones, respectively. In the phase diagram, the SM and TI
phase regimes overlap. At the phase boundary between TI/SM phase and SM phase,
the pair of two Dirac cones of the SM phase coexist with another Dirac cone
that induces topological phase transition into the TI phase. The bulk states
that have three Dirac cones is designated as triple Dirac-cones states. The
triple Dirac-cones state is found to have sizable Berry curvature dipole. In
the SM phase regime, the flat edge states connecting the pair of two Dirac
cones behave as chiral edge states. Near to the TI/SM phase boundary, the
coexistence of the flat edge state and the helical edge state is controlled by
the optical field. The optically controlled triple Dirac-cone state could be
carrier of ternary valleytronic physics.

  Bursts in a Stratified Medium","  The reverse shock (RS) model is generally introduced to interpret the optical
afterglows with the rapid rising and decaying, such as the early optical
afterglow of GRB 990123 (which is also called optical flash). In this paper, we
collected 11 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) early optical afterglows, which have such
signatures of dominant RS emission. Since the temporal slopes of the optical
flashes are determined by both the medium density distribution index $k$ and
the electron spectral index $p$, we apply the RS model of the thin shell case
to the optical flashes and determine the ambient medium of the progenitors. We
find that the $k$ value is in the range of 0 - 1.5. The $k$ value in this paper
is consistent with the result in Yi et al. (2013), where the forward shock (FS)
model was applied to some onset bumps. However, the method adopted in this
paper is only applicable to GRB afterglows with significant sharp rising and
decaying RS emission. Our results indicate that the RS model can also be
applied to confirm the circumburst medium, further implying that GRBs may have
diverse circumburst media.

artificial systems endowed with high-level decision-making capabilities. In
this regard, systems must learn about the usual vehicle's behavior to predict
imminent difficulties before they happen. An autonomous agent should be capable
of continuously interacting with multi-modal dynamic environments while
learning unseen novel concepts. Such environments are not often available to
train the agent on it, so the agent should have an understanding of its own
capacities and limitations. This understanding is usually called
self-awareness. This paper proposes a multi-modal self-awareness modeling of
signals coming from different sources. This paper shows how different machine
learning techniques can be used under a generic framework to learn single
modality models by using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. In the presented case, a
probabilistic switching model and a bank of generative adversarial networks are

classical assumption that the degree of heritability of a continuous trait can
be summarized by a single number.This measure can be used in situations where
the trait dependence structure between family members is nonlinear, in which
case traditional mixed effects models and covariance (correlation) based
methods are inadequate. Our idea is to combine the notion of a correlation
curve with traditional correlation based measures of heritability, such as the
formula of Falconer. For estimation purposes, we use a multivariate Gaussian
mixture, which is able to capture non-linear dependence and respects certain
distributional constraints. We derive an analytical expression for the
associated correlation curve, and investigate its limiting behaviour when the
trait value becomes either large or small. The result is a measure of
heritability that varies with the trait value. When applied to birth weight
data on Norwegian mother father child trios, the conclusion is that low and
high birth weight are less heritable traits than medium birth weight. On the
other hand, we find no similar heterogeneity in the heritability of Body Mass
Index (BMI) when studying monozygotic and dizygotic twins.

is widely used. We find that the energy of a potential magnetic field in a
rectangular domain with periodic lateral boundary conditions is less than that
of the field with a fixed normal component on all six boundaries. To make use
of this lower energy potential field in the analysis of relative magnetic

definition to a sequence of analytic solutions and a numerical simulation. The
results show that our new gauge-invariant helicity is very close to the
current-carrying part of the relative magnetic helicity of the original

helicity and the relative magnetic helicity for the original and our defined

more sensitive to the component of the field due to the electric current in the

Dirac fermions, two-dimensional (2D) Fermi arcs, and one-dimensional (1D) hinge
states. These topological states have different characteristic length scales in
electronic transport, allowing to distinguish their properties when changing

then demonstrate how they can be leveraged for developing a unified framework
that can be trained end-to-end. In particular, we introduce a selective
integration module that allows each task to dynamically choose features at
different levels from the shared backbone based on its own characteristics.
Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive attention module, aiming at
intelligently allocating information for different tasks according to the image
content priors. To evaluate the performance of our proposed network on these
tasks, we conduct exhaustive experiments on multiple representative datasets.
We will show that though these tasks are naturally quite different, our network
can work well on all of them and even perform better than current
single-purpose state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also conduct adequate
ablation analyses that provide a full understanding of the design principles of
the proposed framework. To facilitate future research, source code will be
released.

  of point clouds","  LiDAR point cloud has a complex structure and the 3D semantic labeling of it
is a challenging task. Existing methods adopt data transformations without
fully exploring contextual features, which are less efficient and accurate
problem. In this study, we propose a double self-attention convolutional
network, called DAPnet, by combining geometric and contextual features to
generate better segmentation results. The double self-attention module
including point attention module and group attention module originates from the
self-attention mechanism to extract contextual features of terrestrial objects
with various shapes and scales. The contextual features extracted by these
modules represent the long-range dependencies between the data and are
beneficial to reducing the scale diversity of point cloud objects. The point
attention module selectively enhances the features by modeling the
interdependencies of neighboring points. Meanwhile, the group attention module
is used to emphasizes interdependent groups of points. We evaluate our method
based on the ISPRS 3D Semantic Labeling Contest dataset and find that our model
outperforms the benchmark by 85.2% with an overall accuracy of 90.7%. The
improvements over powerline and car are 7.5% and 13%. By conducting ablation
comparison, we find that the point attention module is more effective for the
overall improvement of the model than the group attention module, and the
incorporation of the double self-attention module has an average of 7%
improvement on the pre-class accuracy of the classes. Moreover, the adoption of
the double self-attention module consumes a similar training time as the one
without the attention module for model convergence. The experimental result
shows the effectiveness and efficiency of the DAPnet for the segmentation of
LiDAR point clouds. The source codes are available at

show a wide variety of kinematic features, similiar to those found in
integral-field spectroscopic studies. At z=0 the distribution of galaxies in
the ${\lambda}_{Re}-{\epsilon}$ plane is also in good agreement with results
from observations. Scaling relations at z = 0 indicate that there is critical
mass, $M_{crit} = 10^{10.3} M_{\odot}$, that divides two different regimes when
we include the ${\lambda}_{Re}$ parameter. The simulation shows that the
distribution of galaxies in the ${\lambda}_{Re}-{\epsilon}$ plane evolves with
time until z = 2 when galaxies are equally distributed both in ${\lambda}_{Re}$

found that there is no connection between the angular momentum at z = 2 and z =
0. All systems reach their maximum ${\lambda}_{Re}$ at z = 1 and then steadily
lose angular momentum regardless of their merger history, except for the high
star-forming systems that sustain that maximum value over time. The evolution
of the Re in galaxies that have not experienced any merger in the last 10 Gyr

  Galilei-invariant advection-diffusion, and kinetics of particle mixing","  We consider the dynamics of a separable Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW)
when the random walker is biased by a velocity field in a uniformly growing
domain. Concrete examples for such domains include growing biological cells or
lipid vesicles, biofilms and tissues, but also macroscopic systems such as
expanding aquifers during rainy periods, or the expanding universe. The
considered CTRW can be subdiffusive, normal diffusive or superdiffusive,
including the particular case of a L\'evy flight. We first consider the case of
zero velocity field. In the subdiffusive case, we reveal an interesting time
dependence of the kurtosis of the particle probability density function. In
particular, for a suitable parameter choice, we find that the propagator, which
is fat tailed at short times, may cross over to a Gaussian-like propagator. We
subsequently incorporate the effect of the velocity field and derive a
bi-fractional diffusion-advection equation encoding the time evolution of the
particle distribution. We apply this equation to study the mixing kinetics of
two diffusing pulses, whose peaks move towards each other under the action of
velocity fields acting in opposite directions. This deterministic motion of the
peaks, together with the diffusive spreading of each pulse, tends to increase
particle mixing, thereby counteracting the peak separation induced by the
domain growth. As a result of this competition, different regimes of mixing
arise. In the case of L\'evy flights, apart from the non-mixing regime, one has
two different mixing regimes in the long-time limit, depending on the exact
parameter choice: In one of these regimes, mixing is mainly driven by diffusive
spreading, while in the other mixing is controlled by the velocity fields
acting on each pulse. Possible implications for encounter-controlled reactions
in real systems are discussed.

collisions at high collision energies effectively decouples from the thermal
physics of the fireball. With full decoupling at LHC energies the chiral
condensate relaxes to its vacuum expectation value on a much shorter time scale
than the typical evolution time of the fluid dynamical fields and their
fluctuations. In particular, the net-baryon density remains coupled to the bulk
evolution at all collision energies. As the mass scales of the hadrons are
controlled by the chiral condensate, it is reasonable to employ vacuum masses
in the statistical description of the hadron production at the chemical
freeze-out for high collision energies. We predict that at lower collision
energies the coupling of the chiral condensate to the thermal medium gradually
increases with consequences for the related hadronic masses. A new estimate for
the location of the freeze-out curve takes these effects into account.

mitigate this problem, functionalization of 2D MoS2 using thiols has emerged as
one of the key strategies for engineering defects. Herein, we demonstrate an
approach to controllably engineer the SVs of chemically exfoliated MoS2

real-time balancing market. The aggregator, as the agent responsible for
portfolio balancing, needs to minimize the cost for imbalance satisfaction in
real-time by proposing a set of optimal incentivizing prices for the prosumers.
On the other hand, the prosumers, as price taker and self-interest agents, want
to maximize their profit by changing their supplies or demands and providing
flexibility based on the proposed incentivizing prices. We model this problem
as a bilevel optimization problem. The state-of-the-art approach to solve a
bilevel optimization problem is to reformulate it as a Mixed-Integer
Programming (MIP) problem. Despite recent developments in the solvers for MIP
problems, the computation time for a problem with a large number of decision
variables may not be appropriate for real-time applications. We propose a
convex equivalent optimization problem for the original bilevel one and prove
that the global optimum of the prosumers/aggregator bilevel problem can be
found by solving a convex problem. Also, we demonstrate the efficiency of our
convex equivalent with respect to an MIP formulation in terms of computation

  complex","  The mechanical properties of many supramolecular materials are often
determined by non-covalent interactions that arise from an interplay between
chemical composition and molecular microstructural organization. The reversible
nature of non-covalent interactions gives supramolecular materials responsive
properties that are otherwise difficult to obtain, such as becoming rigid as a
response to mechanical stress. How exactly non-covalent interactions emerge
from microstructure, how they might change in response to applied force or
deformation is not understood. Here we combine Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
and rheology to directly probe the role of chain proximity in polymer
complexes. We observe an increase in chain proximity in response to imposed
flow, which we hypothesize to originate from enhanced hydrogen bonding. The
chain proximity is directly correlated to rod climbing and shear banding. Flow
persists only when applied stresses are low, suggesting a stress-induced
thickening mechanism. We verify that hydrogen bond disruptors can turn off both
the non-trivial flow behavior and the spectroscopic evidence of chain
proximity. The combined rheo-NMR approach shows that it is possible to directly
observe the molecular origins behind supramolecular mechanics, paving the way
for further study into mechano-chemical properties of supramolecular materials.

cone is build up with linearization expressed by first k+1 derivatives of the
singular operator at the base point. Along these lines, a well-defined
submersion is constructed in the cone with uniformly bounded inverse when
approaching the singularity. The fine resolution of the cone by the manifolds
represents an improvement compared to measuring the variation of the nonlinear
operator exclusively by the overall behaviour of the determinant. In case of
finite dimensions, each half-cone is characterized by a constant topological
degree that can be used to investigate a solution curve in general position
with respect to secondary bifurcation. The core of all considerations is given
by some characteristic patterns, valid in the system of undetermined
coefficients that allow for detailed analysis of the power series resulting
from plugging the power series of the ansatz into the power series of the
nonlinear operator.

  labeling Steiner tree problem","  This paper characterizes and discusses devolutionary genetic algorithms and
evaluates their performances in solving the minimum labeling Steiner tree
(MLST) problem. We define devolutionary algorithms as the process of reaching a
feasible solution by devolving a population of super-optimal unfeasible
solutions over time. We claim that distinguishing them from the widely used
evolutionary algorithms is relevant. The most important distinction lies in the
fact that in the former type of processes, the value function decreases over
successive generation of solutions, thus providing a natural stopping condition
for the computation process. We show how classical evolutionary concepts, such
as crossing, mutation and fitness can be adapted to aim at reaching an optimal
or close-to-optimal solution among the first generations of feasible solutions.
We additionally introduce a novel integer linear programming formulation of the
MLST problem and a valid constraint used for speeding up the devolutionary
process. Finally, we conduct an experiment comparing the performances of
devolutionary algorithms to those of state of the art approaches used for
solving randomly generated instances of the MLST problem. Results of this
experiment support the use of devolutionary algorithms for the MLST problem and
their development for other NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.

the much older and well-known large-$N$ limits of vector and matrix field
theories, which are dominated by cactus and planar Feynman diagrams,
respectively. The melonic limit typically appears in tensor field theories,
characterized by an invariance group in which the fields transform as the
product of $r\geq 3$ fundamental representations of $r$ different simple Lie
groups. As the name suggests, in such a limit the perturbative expansion of
free energy and correlators are dominated by melonic diagrams. The latter form
a manageable subset of the planar diagrams, but with a richer structure than
cactus diagrams, and therefore they open the possibility of studying in a
controlled manner new types of fixed points of the renormalization group. We
call \emph{melonic conformal field theories (CFTs)} those fixed-point theories

water supply systems as networks embedded in regionally self-organizing complex

unifying formulation for profiling system size distribution and predicting

Carnot groups. Our intent is to characterize in which groups the only sets with
constant intrinsic normal are the vertical half-spaces. Our viewpoint is
algebraic: such a phenomenon happens if and only if the semigroup generated by
each horizontal half-space is a vertical half-space. We call
\emph{semigenerated} those Carnot groups with this property.
  For Carnot groups of nilpotency step 3 we provide a complete characterization
of semigeneration in terms of whether such groups do not have any Engel-type
quotients. Engel-type groups, which are introduced here, are the minimal (in
terms of quotients) counterexamples.
  In addition, we give some sufficient criteria for semigeneration of Carnot
groups of arbitrary step. For doing this, we define a new class of Carnot
groups, which we call type $(\Diamond)$ and which generalizes the previous
notion of type $(\star)$ defined by M. Marchi. As an application, we get that
in type $ (\Diamond) $ groups and in step 3 groups that do not have any
Engel-type algebra as a quotient, one achieves a strong rectifiability result
for sets of finite perimeter in the sense of Franchi, Serapioni, and
Serra-Cassano.

provides a useful method for templating surface topography for a variety of
novel applications. Many experiments have studied wrinkle formation during the
compression of a rigid film on a relatively soft pre-strained elastic
substrate, and most have focused on the regime where the substrate thickness
can be considered semi-infinite relative to that of the film. As the relative
thickness of the substrate is decreased, the bending stiffness of the film
dominates, causing the bilayer to transition to either local wrinkling or a
global buckling instability. In this work optical microscopy was used to study
the critical parameters that determine the emergence of local wrinkling or
global buckling of freestanding bilayer films consisting of a thin rigid
polymer capping layer on a pre-strained elastomeric substrate. The thickness
ratio of the film and substrate as well as the pre-strain were controlled and
used to create a buckling phase diagram which describes the behaviour of the
system as the ratio of the thickness of the substrate is decreased. A simple
force balance model was developed to understand the thickness and strain
dependences of the wrinkling and buckling modes, with excellent quantitative
agreement being obtained with experiments using only independently measured
material parameters.

  Monte-Carlo density-peak clustering in heterogeneous brain tissue","  Characterizing the properties and orientations of sub-voxel fiber
populations, although essential to study white-matter architecture,
microstructure and connectivity, remains one of the main challenges faced by
the MRI microstructure community. While some progress has been made in
overcoming this challenge using models, signal representations and tractography
algorithms, these approaches are ultimately limited by their key assumptions or
by the lack of specificity of the diffusion signal alone. In order to alleviate
these limitations, we combine diffusion-relaxation MR acquisitions drawing from
tensor-valued diffusion encoding, Monte-Carlo signal inversions that extract
non-parametric intra-voxel distributions of diffusion tensors and relaxation
rates, and density-based clustering techniques into a novel method called
""Monte-Carlo density-peak clustering"" (MC-DPC). This procedure first delineates
clusters in the diffusion-orientation subspace of the distributions outputted
by Monte-Carlo signal inversions and then draws from the statistical aspect of
these inversion algorithms to compute statistics over orientation-resolved
means of diffusivities and relaxation rates. Evaluating MC-DPC on tensor-valued
diffusion- and $T_2$-weighted datasets in silico and in vivo, we demonstrate
its ability to simultaneously capture sub-voxel fiber orientations and
fiber-specific diffusion-relaxation properties that are consistent with the
known anatomy and existing literature. Straightforwardly translatable to other
diffusion-relaxation correlation experiments probing $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, MC-DPC
shows potential in tracking bundle-specific patient-control group differences
and longitudinal microstructural changes, developing new tools for
microstructure-informed tractography, and mapping tract-specific myelination
states.

computer vision applications including medical diagnosis and autonomous
driving. One of the major concerns that these models face is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Realizing the importance of this issue,
more researchers are working towards developing robust models that are less
affected by adversarial attacks. Adversarial training method shows promising
results in this direction. In adversarial training regime, models are trained
with mini-batches augmented with adversarial samples. Fast and simple methods
(e.g., single-step gradient ascent) are used for generating adversarial
samples, in order to reduce computational complexity. It is shown that models
trained using single-step adversarial training method (adversarial samples are
generated using non-iterative method) are pseudo robust. Further, this pseudo
robustness of models is attributed to the gradient masking effect. However,
existing works fail to explain when and why gradient masking effect occurs
during single-step adversarial training. In this work, (i) we show that models
trained using single-step adversarial training method learn to prevent the
generation of single-step adversaries, and this is due to over-fitting of the
model during the initial stages of training, and (ii) to mitigate this effect,
we propose a single-step adversarial training method with dropout scheduling.
Unlike models trained using existing single-step adversarial training methods,
models trained using the proposed single-step adversarial training method are
robust against both single-step and multi-step adversarial attacks, and the
performance is on par with models trained using computationally expensive
multi-step adversarial training methods, in white-box and black-box settings.

alternative to mean bias reduction. The estimator is obtained as solution to a
modified score ensuring smaller asymptotic median bias than the maximum
likelihood estimator. This paper provides a simplified algebraic form of the
adjustment term. With the new formula, the estimation procedure benefits from a
considerable computational gain by avoiding multiple summations and thus allows
an efficient implementation for general parametric models. More importantly,
the new formulation allows to highlight how the median bias reduction
adjustment can be obtained by adding an extra term to the mean bias reduction
adjustment. Illustrations are provided through new applications of median bias
reduction to extended beta regression and beta-binomial regression. Mean bias
reduction is also provided here for the latter model. Simulation studies show
remarkable componentwise median centering of the median bias reduced estimator,
while dispersion and coverage of related confidence intervals are comparable
with those of its main competitors. Moreover, for the beta-binomial model the
method is successful in solving the boundary estimate problem.

resistor and its parasitic capacitance in high-speed applications. To overcome
this drawback, a capacitive feedback TIA (CF-TIA) can be used. The gain and
bandwidth performance of the CF-TIA are theoretically equivalent to those of
the RF-TIA. Although CF-TIA has been introduced in previous studies for
reducing thermal noise and addressing the difficulty in integrating a high

  Semiconductors","  Strong many-body interactions in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors give
rise to efficient exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA). This process is expected
to result in the generation of unbound high energy carriers. Here, we report an
unconventional photoresponse of van der Waals heterostructure devices resulting
from efficient EEA. Our heterostructures, which consist of monolayer transition
metal dichalcogenide (TMD), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and few-layer
graphene, exhibit photocurrent when photoexcited carriers possess sufficient
energy to overcome the high energy barrier of hBN. Interestingly, we find that
the device exhibits moderate photocurrent quantum efficiency even when the
semiconducting TMD layer is excited at its ground exciton resonance despite the
high exciton binding energy and large transport barrier. Using ab initio
calculations, we show that EEA yields highly energetic electrons and holes with
unevenly distributed energies depending on the scattering condition. Our
findings highlight the dominant role of EEA in determining the photoresponse of
2D semiconductor optoelectronic devices.

  Two Variables per Inequality","  We present a strongly polynomial label-correcting algorithm for solving the
feasibility of linear systems with two variables per inequality (2VPI). The
algorithm is based on the Newton-Dinkelbach method for fractional combinatorial
optimization. We extend and strengthen previous work of Madani (2002) that
showed a weakly polynomial bound for a variant of the Newton-Dinkelbach method
for solving deterministic Markov decision processes (DMDPs), a special class of
2VPI linear programs. For a 2VPI system with $n$ variables and $m$ constraints,
our algorithm runs in $O(mn)$ iterations. Every iteration takes $O(m + n\log
n)$ time for DMDPs, and $O(mn)$ time for general 2VPI systems.
  The key technical idea is a new analysis of the Newton-Dinkelbach method
exploiting gauge symmetries of the algorithm. This also leads to an
acceleration of the Newton-Dinkelbach method for general fractional
combinatorial optimization problems. For the special case of linear fractional
combinatorial optimization, our method converges in $O(m\log m)$ iterations,
improving upon the previous best bound of $O(m^2\log m)$ by Wang et al. (2006).

internal flow. In a simple model, this flow is generated by a collection of
point forces, which represent externally actuated devices or model autonomous
swimmers. We work out the general framework to compute the self-propulsion of
the droplet as a function of the actuating forces and their positions within
the droplet. A single point force, F with general orientation and position,
r_0, gives rise to both, translational and rotational motion of the droplet. We
show that the translational mobility is anisotropic and the rotational mobility
can be nonmonotonic as a function of | r_0|, depending on the viscosity
contrast. Due to the linearity of the Stokes equation, superposition can be
used to discuss more complex arrays of point forces. We analyse force dipoles,
such as a stresslet, a simple model of a biflagellate swimmer and a rotlet,
representing a helical swimmer, driven by an external magnetic field. For a
general force distribution with arbitrary high multipole moments the propulsion
properties of the droplet depend only on a few low order multipoles: up to the
quadrupole for translational and up to a special octopole for rotational
motion. The coupled motion of droplet and device is discussed for a few
exemplary cases. We show in particular that a biflagellate swimmer, modeled as
a stresslet, achieves a steady comoving state, where the position of the device
relative to the droplet remains fixed. In fact there are two fixpoints,
symmetric with respect to the center of the droplet. A tiny external force
selects one of them and allows to switch between forward and backward motion.

In video prediction, the shape, appearance, and transformation of each object

  operations","  In a superconducting quantum processor with nearest neighbor coupling, the
dispersive interaction between adjacent qubits can result in an effective
next-nearest-neighbor coupling for which the strength depends on the state of
the intermediary qubit. Here, we theoretically explore the possibility of
engineering this next-nearest-neighbor coupling for implementing controlled
two-qubit operations where the intermediary qubit controls the operation on the
next-nearest neighbor pair of qubits. Specially, in a system comprising two
types of superconducting qubits with opposite-sign anharmonicity arranged in an
-A-B-A- pattern, where the unwanted static ZZ coupling between adjacent qubits
could be heavily suppressed, a switchable coupling between the
next-nearest-neighbor qubits can be achieved via the intermediary qubit, for
which the qubit state functions as an on/off switch for this coupling.
Therefore, depending on the adopted activating scheme, various controlled
two-qubit operations such as controlled-iSWAP gate can be realized, potentially
enabling circuit depth reductions as to a standard decomposition approach for
implementing generic quantum algorithms.

  Things","  In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, edge computing can be initiated
at anytime and anywhere. However, in an IoT, edge computing sessions are often
ephemeral, i.e., they last for a short period of time and can often be
discontinued once the current application usage is completed or the edge
devices leave the system due to factors such as mobility. Therefore, in this
paper, the problem of ephemeral edge computing in an IoT is studied by
considering scenarios in which edge computing operates within a limited time
period. To this end, a novel online framework is proposed in which a source
edge node offloads its computing tasks from sensors within an area to
neighboring edge nodes for distributed task computing, within the limited
period of time of an ephemeral edge computing system. The online nature of the
framework allows the edge nodes to optimize their task allocation and decide on
which neighbors to use for task processing, even when the tasks are revealed to
the source edge node in an online manner, and the information on future task
arrivals is unknown. The proposed framework essentially maximizes the number of
computed tasks by jointly considering the communication and computation
latency. To solve the problem, an online greedy algorithm is proposed and
solved by using the primal-dual approach. Since the primal problem provides an
upper bound of the original dual problem, the competitive ratio of the online
approach is analytically derived as a function of the task sizes and the data
rates of the edge nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed online
algorithm can achieve a near-optimal task allocation with an optimality gap
that is no higher than 7.1% compared to the offline, optimal solution with
complete knowledge of all tasks.

focused on segmenting the object parts that enable specific types of
human-object interaction, the so-called ""object affordances"". However, most
works treat it as a static semantic segmentation problem, focusing solely on
object appearance and relying on strong supervision and object detection. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach that exploits the spatio-temporal
nature of human-object interaction for affordance segmentation. In particular,
we design an autoencoder that is trained using ground-truth labels of only the
last frame of the sequence, and is able to infer pixel-wise affordance labels
in both videos and static images. Our model surpasses the need for object
labels and bounding boxes by using a soft-attention mechanism that enables the
implicit localization of the interaction hotspot. For evaluation purposes, we
introduce the SOR3D-AFF corpus, which consists of human-object interaction
sequences and supports 9 types of affordances in terms of pixel-wise
annotation, covering typical manipulations of tool-like objects. We show that
our model achieves competitive results compared to strongly supervised methods
on SOR3D-AFF, while being able to predict affordances for similar unseen
objects in two affordance image-only datasets.

to be capable of mastering complicated decision-making tasks, the sample
complexity of these methods has remained a hurdle to utilizing them in many
real-world applications. In this regard, model-based reinforcement learning
proposes some remedies. Yet, inherently, model-based methods are more
computationally expensive and susceptible to sub-optimality. One reason is that
model-generated data are always less accurate than real data, and this often
leads to inaccurate transition and reward function models. With the aim to
mitigate this problem, this work presents the notion of survival by discussing
cases in which the agent's goal is to survive and its analogy to maximizing the
expected rewards. To that end, a substitute model for the reward function
approximator is introduced that learns to avoid terminal states rather than to
maximize accumulated rewards from safe states. Focusing on terminal states, as
a small fraction of state-space, reduces the training effort drastically. Next,
a model-based reinforcement learning method is proposed (Survive) to train an
agent to avoid dangerous states through a safety map model built upon temporal
credit assignment in the vicinity of terminal states. Finally, the performance
of the presented algorithm is investigated, along with a comparison between the
proposed and current methods.

contacts using an Erdos-Renyi random graph representing a city, and simulate
outcomes for two kinds of agents, poor and non-poor. Under non-intervention,
peak caseload is maximised, but no differences are observed in infection rates
across poor and non-poor. When we introduce different forms of social
distancing interventions, peak caseloads are reduced, but infection rates of
the poor are systematically higher than for non-poor across all scenarios.
Larger populations, higher fractions of poor, and greater intensity of
interventions are found to progressively worsen outcomes for the poor,
vis-a-vis the non-poor. Increasing population leads to higher infection rates
among the poor, supporting concerns that households in large high-density
settlements like slums amongst the most at-risk population groups during an
outbreak. Related to this, increasing population of the urban poor is found to
worsen infection outcomes of the poor, and given the expansion of developing
cities into large metropolises, this is an issue of significant concern for
public health and economic wellbeing. The poor are also found
disproportionately affected by increasing length and intensity of social
distancing measures, pointing to the immediate need for countries to have clear
guidelines on how social distancing can be practiced in high density slum
settlements, given local contexts. Sustainable solutions for the long-term will
require concerted investment in environmental and physical infrastructure to
improve living conditions. Finally, addressing these iniquitous outcomes for
the poor creates better outcomes for the whole population, including the
non-poor.

energy dissipation rate, $\mathbb{E} [\langle\varepsilon \rangle] $, are
derived directly from the equations. First, we show that for a weak

\mathbb{E} [\langle\varepsilon \rangle] \leq G^2 + (2+

the random force, $U$ is the root-mean-square velocity, $L$ is the longest
length scale in the applied forcing function, and $Re$ is the Reynolds number.
Under an additional assumption of energy equality, we also derive a lower bound
if the energy rate given by the random force dominates the deterministic
behavior of the flow in the sense that $G^2 > 2 F U$, where $F$ is the
amplitude of the deterministic force. We obtain, \[\frac{1}{3} G^2 -
\frac{1}{3} (2+ \frac{1}{Re})\frac{U^3}{L} \leq \mathbb{E} [\langle\varepsilon

first, we contribute a high-quality dataset named OPIXray, each of which is
annotated manually by professional inspectors from an international airport. To

the attention map by hybridizing the two feature maps generated by EIEM and
RIAM to serve a refined feature map to a general detector. We evaluate our

popular methods for detection and attention mechanisms. As is shown from the

aspect of TC physics. Here, we study spontaneous TC genesis using
cloud-resolving simulations over an f-plane with constant sea-surface
temperature. Previous studies proposed that spontaneous TC genesis requires
either radiative or surface-flux feedbacks. To test this hypothesis, we perform
mechanism-denial experiments, in which we switch off both feedback processes.
We find that TCs can self-emerge even without radiative and surface-flux
feedbacks. Although these feedbacks accelerate the genesis and impact the size
of the TCs, TCs can reach similar intensities as those in the control
experiment without these feedbacks. We show that TC genesis is associated with
an abrupt increase in the Available Potential Energy (APE) and that convective
heating dominates the APE production. Our result suggests that spontaneous TC
genesis may result from a cooperative interaction between convection and
circulation, and that radiative and surface-flux feedbacks accelerate the
process.

marginal properties of the process. In many practical situations, a major
modeling limitation is that it is difficult to justify the choice of the

build an INAR model: we pre-specify the marginal and innovation distributions.
Hence, the operator is a consequence of specifying the desired marginal and
innovation distributions. Our new INAR model has both marginal and innovations
geometric distributed, being a direct alternative to the classical Poisson INAR
model. Our proposed process has interesting stochastic properties such as an
MA($\infty$) representation, time-reversibility, and closed-forms for the

planning actions toward maximizing cumulative reward over a long, unspecified
horizon. On the other hand, probabilistic planning frameworks, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), well support
planning to achieve long-term goals under uncertainty. But they are
ill-equipped to represent or reason about knowledge that is not directly
related to actions.
  In this article, we present a novel algorithm, called iCORPP, to
simultaneously estimate the current world state, reason about world dynamics,
and construct task-oriented controllers. In this process, robot decision-making
problems are decomposed into two interdependent (smaller) subproblems that
focus on reasoning to ""understand the world"" and planning to ""achieve the goal""
respectively. Contextual knowledge is represented in the reasoning component,
which makes the planning component epistemic and enables active information
gathering. The developed algorithm has been implemented and evaluated both in
simulation and on real robots using everyday service tasks, such as indoor
navigation, dialog management, and object delivery. Results show significant
improvements in scalability, efficiency, and adaptiveness, compared to
competitive baselines including handcrafted action policies.

  two-dimensional electron systems","  Suppressing electron scattering is essential to achieve high-mobility
two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs) that are clean enough to probe exotic
interaction-driven phenomena. In heterostructures it is common practice to
utilize modulation doping, where the ionized dopants are physically separated
from the 2DES channel. The doping-well structure augments modulation doping by
providing additional screening for all types of charged impurities in the
vicinity of the 2DES, which is necessary to achieve record-breaking samples.
Despite its prevalence in the design of ultra-high-mobility 2DESs, the working
principles of the doping-well structure have not been reported. Here we
elaborate on the mechanics of electron transfer from doping wells to the 2DES,
focusing on GaAs/AlGaAs samples grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Based on this
understanding we demonstrate how structural parameters in the doping well can
be varied to tune the properties of the 2DES.

superiority in both computational and learning aspects compared to other

By partial resolution of the classical Abel-Jacobi map, we construct a
universal twisted double ramification cycle $\mathsf{DR}^{\mathsf{op}}_{g,A}$
as an operational Chow class on the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$ of
$n$-pointed genus $g$ curves carrying a degree $d$ line bundle. The method of
construction follows the log (and b-Chow) approach to the standard double
ramification cycle with canonical twists on the moduli space of curves
[arXiv:1707.02261, arXiv:1711.10341, arXiv:1708.04471].
  Our main result is a calculation of $\mathsf{DR}^{\mathsf{op}}_{g,A}$ on the
Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$ via an appropriate interpretation of
Pixton's formula in the tautological ring. The basic new tool used in the proof
is the theory of double ramification cycles for target varieties
[arXiv:1812.10136]. The formula on the Picard stack is obtained from
[arXiv:1812.10136] for target varieties $\mathbb{CP}^n$ in the limit $n
\rightarrow \infty$. The result may be viewed as a universal calculation in
Abel-Jacobi theory.
  As a consequence of the calculation of $\mathsf{DR}^{\mathsf{op}}_{g,A}$ on
the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$, we prove that the fundamental
classes of the moduli spaces of twisted meromorphic differentials in
$\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ are exactly given by Pixton's formula (as
conjectured in the appendix to [arXiv:1508.07940] and in [arXiv:1607.08429]).
The comparison result of fundamental classes proven in [arXiv:1909.11981] plays
a crucial role in our argument. We also prove the set of relations in the
tautological ring of the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$ associated to
Pixton's formula.

a classical algorithm to efficiently sample from the effective subspace of a
$k$-local stoquastic Hamiltonian $H$, without a priori knowledge of its

exploit graph isomorphism to study the automorphisms of $G$ and arrive at an
algorithm quasi-polynomial in $\lvert V\rvert$ for producing samples from the
effective subspace eigenstates of $H$. Our results rule out exponential
separations between stoquastic AQC and classical computation that arise from
hidden symmetries in $k$-local Hamiltonians. Furthermore, our graph

out corresponding obstructions in non-stoquastic cases, or be useful in
studying additional properties of $k$-local Hamiltonians.

determined by universal functions which, at high temperature, are governed by
universal virial coefficients $b_n$ that capture the effects of the $n$-body

been made for $b_5$. To answer these open questions, we implement a
nonperturbative analytic approach based on the Trotter-Suzuki factorization of
the imaginary-time evolution operator, using progressively finer temporal
lattice spacings. Implementing these factorizations and automated algebra
codes, we obtain the interaction-induced change $\Delta b_n$ from weak coupling

leading vehicle's trajectory is used by the subject vehicle to detect sensor
anomalies. We use the classic $\chi^2$ fault detector in conjunction with the

block-fading wiretap channels with limited channel knowledge at the
transmitter. More particularly, we analyze the effect of having a finite rate
feedback on the throughput of multi-user broadcast wiretap channels. We
consider that the transmitter is only provided by a $b$-bits feedback of the
main channel state information (CSI) sent by each legitimate receiver, at the
beginning of each fading block, over error-free public links with limited
capacity. Also, we assume that the transmitter is aware of the statistics of
the eavesdropper's CSI but not of its channel's realizations. Under these
assumptions of CSI uncertainty, we characterize the ergodic secrecy capacity of
the system when a common message is broadcasted to all legitimate receivers,
the ergodic secrecy sum-capacity when multiple independent messages are
transmitted, and the ergodic secrecy capacity region for the broadcast channel
with confidential messages (BCCM). In all three scenarios, we show that as long
as the transmitter has some knowledge of the main CSI, obtained even through a
1-bit CSI feedback, a non-zero secrecy rate can still be achieved. The impact
of having the feedback sent over a binary erasure channel (BEC) is also
investigated for the BCCM case. Here again, and even with the possibility of
having the feedback bits erased, a positive secrecy rate can still be achieved
as long as the erasure event is not a probability-one event. An asymptotic
analysis of the obtained results is provided for the high SNR regime, and the
scaling law of the system, when the number of legitimate receivers is large, is
also presented.

  Prediction","  In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for the task of 3D human
motion modelling. We argue that the problem can be interpreted as a generative
modelling task: A network learns the conditional synthesis of human poses where
the model is conditioned on a seed sequence. Our focus lies on the generation
of plausible future developments over longer time horizons, whereas previous
work considered shorter time frames of up to 1 second. To mitigate the issue of
convergence to a static pose, we propose a novel architecture that leverages
the recently proposed self-attention concept. The task of 3D motion prediction
is inherently spatio-temporal and thus the proposed model learns high
dimensional joint embeddings followed by a decoupled temporal and spatial
self-attention mechanism. The two attention blocks operate in parallel to
aggregate the most informative components of the sequence to update the joint
representation. This allows the model to access past information directly and
to capture spatio-temporal dependencies explicitly. We show empirically that
this reduces error accumulation over time and allows for the generation of
perceptually plausible motion sequences over long time horizons as well as
accurate short-term predictions. Accompanying video available at

  Recognition","  Spectral pattern recognition is used to measure temperature and generate
calibrated wavelength/frequency combs using a single silicon waveguide ring
resonator. The ring generates two incommensurate interleaving TE and TM
spectral combs that shift independently with temperature to create a spectral
pattern that is unique at every temperature. Following an initial calibration,
the ring temperature can be determined by recognizing the spectral resonance
pattern, and as a consequence the wavelength of every resonance is also known.
Two methods of pattern based temperature retrieval are presented. In the first
method, the ring is locked to a previously determined temperature set-point
defined by the coincidence of only two specific TE and TM cavity modes. Based
on a prior calibration at the set-point, the ring temperature and hence all
resonance wavelengths are then known and the resulting comb can be used as a
wavelength calibration reference. In this configuration, all reference comb
wavelengths have been reproduced within a 5 pm accuracy across an 80 nm range
by using an on-chip micro-heater to tune the ring. For more general photonic
thermometry, a spectral correlation algorithm is developed to recognize a
resonance pattern across a 30 nm wide spectral window and thereby determine
ring temperature continuously to 50 mK accuracy. The correlation method is
extended to simultaneously determine temperature and to identify and correct
for wavelength calibration errors in the interrogating light source. The
temperature and comb wavelength accuracy is limited primarily by the linewidth
of the ring resonances, with accuracy and resolution scaling with the ring
quality factor.

Instead, there might be an underlying causal structure due to physics laws. We
thus propose a new VAE based framework named CausalVAE, which includes causal
layers to transform independent factors into causal factors that correspond to
causally related concepts in data. We analyze the model identifiabitily of
CausalVAE, showing that the generative model learned from the observational

various datasets, including synthetic datasets consisting of pictures with
multiple causally related objects abstracted from physical world, and a

by CausalVAE are semantically interpretable, and lead to better results on
downstream tasks. The new framework allows causal intervention, by which we can
intervene any causal concepts to generate artificial data.

(DTN), however, efficient data transfer in DTN is still an important issue for
the IoT applications. One of the application areas of DTN is Vehicular Delay
Tolerant Network (VDTN) where the network faces communication disruption due to
lack of end-to-end relay route. It is challenging as some of the nodes show
selfish behavior to preserve their resources like memory, and energy level and
become non-cooperative. In this article, an Honesty based Democratic Scheme
(HBDS) is introduced where vehicles with higher honesty level are elected as
heads -- during the process. Vehicles involved in the process would maximize
their rewards (reputation) through active participation in the network
activities whereas nodes with non-cooperative selfish behavior are punished.
The honesty level of the heads is analyzed using Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves
(VCG) model. The mathematical model and algorithms developed in the proposed
HBDS technique are simulated using the VDTNSim framework to evaluate their
efficiency. The performance results show that the proposed scheme dominates

peak. This improves welfare if the peak exceeds the capacity of the healthcare
system and the social loss rises rapidly enough in the number infected. The
individual incentive to get infected early comes from the greater likelihood of
receiving treatment than at the peak when the disease has overwhelmed
healthcare capacity. Calibration to the Covid-19 pandemic data suggests that
catching the infection at the start was individually optimal and for some loss

transmission expansion planning (TEP) formulations uses bus voltage angles as
auxiliary optimization variables to describe Kirchhoff's voltage law. As well
as introducing a large number of auxiliary variables, the angle-based
formulation has the disadvantage that it is not well-suited to considering the
connection of multiple disconnected networks, It is, however, possible to
circumvent these auxiliary variables and reduce the required number of
constraints by expressing Kirchhoff's voltage law directly in terms of the
power flows, based on a cycle decomposition of the network graph. In
computationally challenging benchmarks such as generation capacity expansion
with multi-period LOPF, this equivalent reformulation was shown in previous
work to reduce solving times for LOPF problems by an order of magnitude.
Allowing line capacity to be co-optimized in a discrete TEP problem makes it a
non-convex mixed-integer problem. This paper develops a novel cycle-based
reformulation for the TEP problem with LOPF and compares it to the standard
angle-based formulation. The combinatorics of the connection of multiple
disconnected networks is formalized for both formulations, a topic which has
not received attention in the literature. The cycle-based formulation is shown
to conveniently accommodate synchronization options. Since both formulations
use the big-$M$ disjunctive relaxation, useful derivations for suitable big-$M$
values are provided. The competing formulations are benchmarked on a realistic
generation and transmission expansion model of the European transmission system
at varying spatial and temporal resolutions. The cycle-based formulation solves
up to 31 times faster for particular cases, while averaging at a speed-up of
factor 4.

$\mathcal{G}$ be a random subgraph of $G$ that includes each edge $e \in E$
independently with probability $p$. In the {\em stochastic matching} problem,
the goal is to pick a sparse subgraph $Q$ of $G$ without knowing the
realization $\mathcal{G}$, such that the maximum weight matching among the
realized edges of $Q$ (i.e. graph $Q \cap \mathcal{G}$) in expectation
approximates the maximum weight matching of the whole realization
$\mathcal{G}$.
  In this paper, we prove that for any desirably small $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$,
every graph $G$ has a subgraph $Q$ that guarantees a
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximation and has maximum degree only $O_{\epsilon, p}(1)$.
That is, the maximum degree of $Q$ depends only on $\epsilon$ and $p$ (both of
which are known to be necessary) and not for example on the number of nodes in
$G$, the edge-weights, etc.
  The stochastic matching problem has been studied extensively on both weighted
and unweighted graphs. Previously, only existence of (close to)
half-approximate subgraphs was known for weighted graphs [Yamaguchi and
Maehara, SODA'18; Behnezhad et al., SODA'19]. Our result substantially improves
over these works, matches the state-of-the-art for unweighted graphs [Behnezhad

$z \sim 2.4 - 5.1$, is largely cosmologically unprobed. In this paper we use
these QSO measurements, alone and in conjunction with baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) and Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, to constrain
cosmological parameters in six different cosmological models, each with two
different Hubble constant priors. In most of these models, given the larger
uncertainties, the QSO cosmological parameter constraints are mostly consistent
with those from the $H(z)$ + BAO data. A somewhat significant exception is the
non-relativistic matter density parameter $\Omega_{m0}$ where the QSO data
favors $\Omega_{m0} \sim 0.5 - 0.6$ in most models. Consequently in joint
analyses of QSO data with $H(z)$ + BAO data the one-dimensional $\Omega_{m0}$
distributions shift slightly toward larger values. A joint analysis of the QSO
+ $H(z)$ + BAO data is consistent with the current standard model,
spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM, but mildly favors closed spatial hypersurfaces and
dynamical dark energy. Since the higher $\Omega_{m0}$ values favored by the QSO
data appear to be associated with the $z \sim 2 - 5$ part of these data, and
conflict somewhat with strong indications for $\Omega_{m0} \sim 0.3$ from most
$z < 2.5$ data as well as from the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data
at $z \sim 1100$, in most models, the larger QSO data $\Omega_{m0}$ is possibly
more indicative of an issue with the $z \sim 2 - 5$ QSO data than of an
inadequacy of the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model.

the covariates of instances to obtain a benefit. Most approaches to such
problems have focused on game-theoretic ideas with strong underlying common
knowledge assumptions, which are not realistic in the security realm. We
provide an alternative Bayesian framework that accounts for the lack of precise
knowledge about the attacker's behavior using adversarial risk analysis. A key
ingredient required by our framework is the ability to sample from the
distribution of originating instances given the possibly attacked observed one.
We propose a sampling procedure based on approximate Bayesian computation, in
which we simulate the attacker's problem taking into account our uncertainty
about his elements. For large scale problems, we propose an alternative,
scalable approach that could be used when dealing with differentiable
classifiers. Within it, we move the computational load to the training phase,
simulating attacks from an adversary, adapting the framework to obtain a
classifier robustified against attacks.

distinguish integrable versus chaotic (non-integrable) quantum many-body
dynamics. Following this line of thoughts, here we propose that the revivals in
the entanglement entropy provide a finite-size diagnostic benchmark for the
purpose. Indeed, integrable models display periodic revivals manifested in a
dip in the block entanglement entropy in a finite system. On the other hand, in
chaotic systems, initial correlations get dispersed in the global degrees of
freedom (information scrambling) and such a dip is suppressed. We show that
while for integrable systems the height of the dip of the entanglement of an
interval of fixed length decays as a power law with the total system size, upon
breaking integrability a much faster decay is observed, signalling strong
scrambling. Our results are checked by exact numerical techniques in
free-fermion and free-boson theories, and by time-dependent density matrix
renormalisation group in interacting integrable and chaotic models.

  as a topological defect","  A continuum model of fracture that describes, in principle, the propagation
and interaction of arbitrary distributions of cracks and voids with evolving
topology without a fracture criterion is developed. It involves a 'law of
motion' for crack-tips, primarily as a kinematical consequence coupled with
thermodynamics. Fundamental kinematics endows the crack-tip with a topological
charge. This allows the association of a kinematical conservation law for the
charge, resulting in a fundamental evolution equation for the crack-tip field,
and in turn the crack field. The vectorial crack field degrades the elastic
modulus in a physically justified anisotropic manner. The mathematical
structure of this conservation law allows an additive 'free' gradient of a
scalar field in the evolution of the crack field. We associate this naturally
emerging scalar field with the porosity that arises in the modeling of ductile
failure. Thus, porosity-rate gradients affect the evolution of the crack-field
which, then, naturally degrades the elastic modulus, and it is through this
fundamental mechanism that spatial gradients in porosity growth affects the
strain-energy density and stress carrying capacity of the material - and, as a
dimensional consequence related to fundamental kinematics, introduces a
length-scale in the model. The key hypothesis of this work is that brittle
fracture is energy-driven while ductile fracture is stress-driven; under
overall shear loadings where mean stress vanishes or is compressive, shear
strain energy can still drive shear fracture in ductile materials.

dephasing induced by noise of a classical environment. The scheme builds upon
the key idea that this kind of noise can be recorded by a classical device
during the qubit evolution, and that its effect can be undone by a suitable
control sequence that is conditioned on the measurement result. We specifically
demonstrate this scheme on a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center that strongly couples
to current noise in a nearby conductor. By conditioning the readout observable
on a measurement of the current, we recover the full qubit coherence and the
qubit's intrinsic coherence time $T_2$. We demonstrate that this scheme
provides a simple way to implement single-qubit gates with an infidelity of
$10^{-2}$ even if they are driven by noisy sources, and we estimate that an
infidelity of $10^{-5}$ could be reached with additional improvements. We
anticipate this method to find widespread adoption in experiments using fast
control pulses driven from strong currents, in particular in nanoscale magnetic
resonance imaging, where control of peak currents of 100 mA with a bandwidth of
100 MHz is required.

Q-factor and sensitivity of the microwave receiver. The bound for the

for high-Q resonance microwave sensors of arbitrary geometry. Even though
several well-established protocols based on optical, infrared and X-ray

it has become very hard to detect or infiltrate the cynicism of bots. This, is
owing to the fact, that, the botnet developers each day, keep changing the
propagation and attack techniques. Currently, most of these attacks have been
centered on stealing computing energy, theft of personal information and
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, the authors
propose a novel technique that uses the Non-Deterministic Polynomial-Time
Hardness (NP-Hard Problem) based on the Traveling Salesperson Person (TSP) that
depicts that a given bot, bj, is able to visit each host on a network
environment, NE, and then it returns to the botmaster, in form of
instruction(command), through optimal minimization of the hosts that are (may)
be attacked. Given that bj represents a piece of malicious code and TSP-NP Hard
Problem, which forms part of combinatorial optimization, the authors present
this as an effective approach for the detection of the botnet. It is worth
noting that the concentration of this study is basically on the centralized
botnet architecture. This holistic approach shows that botnet detection
accuracy can be increased with a degree of certainty and potentially decrease
the chances of false positives. Nevertheless, a discussion on the possible
applicability and implementation has also been given in this paper.

and socio-demographic processes. The most commonly used models for multivariate
spatial covariances assume both stationarity and symmetry for the
cross-covariances, but these assumptions are rarely tenable in practice. In
this article we introduce a new and highly flexible class of nonstationary and
asymmetric multivariate spatial covariance models that are constructed by
modeling the simpler and more familiar stationary and symmetric multivariate
covariances on a warped domain. Inspired by recent developments in the
univariate case, we propose modeling the warping function as a composition of a
number of simple injective warping functions in a deep-learning framework.
Importantly, covariance-model validity is guaranteed by construction. We
establish the types of warpings that allow for symmetry and asymmetry, and we
use likelihood-based methods for inference that are computationally efficient.
The utility of this new class of models is shown through various data
illustrations, including a simulation study on nonstationary data and an
application on ocean temperatures at two different depths.

using free energy methods, these fail when the underlying classical mechanical
force fields are insufficient. In principle, a more accurate approach is
provided by quantum mechanical density functional theory (DFT) scoring, but
even with approximations, this has yet to become practical on drug
discovery-relevant timescales and resources. Here, we describe how to overcome
this barrier using algorithms for DFT calculations that scale on widely
available cloud architectures, enabling full density functional theory, without
approximations, to be applied to protein-ligand complexes with approximately
2500 atoms in tens of minutes. Applying this to a realistic example of 22
ligands binding to MCL1 reveals that density functional scoring outperforms
classical free energy perturbation theory for this system. This raises the

been linked to increased anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States. Recently,
Broniatowski et al. found that foreign powers, and especially Russia, were
implicated in information operations using public health crises to promote
discord -- including racial conflict -- in American society (Broniatowski,
2018). This brief considers the problem of automatically detecting changes in
overall attitudes, that may be associated with emerging information operations,
via artificial intelligence. Accurate analysis of these emerging topics usually
requires laborious, manual analysis by experts to annotate millions of tweets
to identify biases in new topics. We introduce extensions of the Word Embedding
Association Test from Caliskan et. al to a new domain (Caliskan, 2017). This
practical and unsupervised method is applied to quantify biases being promoted
in information operations. Analyzing historical information operations from
Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, we quantify
biased attitudes for presidential candidates, and sentiment toward Muslim
groups. We next apply this method to a corpus of tweets containing anti-Chinese
hashtags. We find that roughly 1% of tweets in our corpus reference
Russian-funded news sources and use anti-Chinese hashtags and, beyond the
expected anti-Chinese attitudes, we find that this corpus as a whole contains
pro-Russian attitudes, which are not present in a control Twitter corpus
containing general tweets. Additionally, 4% of the users in this corpus were
suspended within a week. These findings may indicate the presence of abusive
account activity associated with rapid changes in attitudes around the COVID-19
public health crisis, suggesting potential information operations.

well, as do methods that extract alignments jointly with translations in NMT.
However, most approaches require parallel training data and quality decreases
as less training data is available. We propose word alignment methods that
require no parallel data. The key idea is to leverage multilingual word
embeddings, both static and contextualized, for word alignment. Our
multilingual embeddings are created from monolingual data only without relying
on any parallel data or dictionaries. We find that alignments created from
embeddings are competitive and mostly superior to traditional statistical
aligners, even in scenarios with abundant parallel data. For example, for a set
of 100k parallel sentences, contextualized embeddings achieve a word alignment
F1 for English-German that is more than 5% higher (absolute) than eflomal, a
high quality alignment model.

which may be interpreted as the biological relationship between cognitive

explainable. The selected finger-tapping attributes can be considered as

degenerated by the noise existing in features and/or labels. There are quite
many papers that handle the problem of either feature or label noise,
separately. However, to the best of our knowledge, this piece of research is
the first attempt to address the problem of concurrent occurrence of both types
of noise. Basing on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, we
experimentally proved that the difference by which committees beat single
models increases along with noise level, no matter it is an attribute or label
disruption. Thus, it makes ensembles legitimate to be applied to noisy images
with noisy labels. The aforementioned committees' advantage over single models
is positively correlated with dataset difficulty level as well. We propose
three committee selection algorithms that outperform a strong baseline
algorithm which relies on an ensemble of individual (nonassociated) best
models.

previously published data and analyze additional Hubble Space Telescope (HST)

to be a directly imaged catastrophic collision between two large planetesimals

polarization-parametric images to task network so as to complete a vison task.
By training together, the PPCN can learn to provide the most suitable

fingerprinting, information theoretic method, feature learning, and
discriminatory power of deep learning. Specifically, an autoencoder is used to
automatically extract features from the RF traces, and the reconstruction error
is used as the DAC and this DAC is unique to the device and the particular
message of interest. Then Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is used to match the
distribution of the reconstruction error generated by the autoencoder and the
received message, and the result will determine whether the device of interest
belongs to an authorized user. We validate this concept on two experimentally
collected RF traces from six ZigBee and five universal software defined radio
peripheral (USRP) devices, respectively. The traces span a range of Signalto-
Noise Ratio by varying locations and mobility of the devices and channel
interference and noise to ensure robustness of the model. Experimental results
demonstrate that DAC is able to prevent device impersonation by extracting
salient features that are unique to any wireless device of interest and can be
used to identify RF devices. Furthermore, the proposed method does not need the
RF traces of the intruder during model training yet be able to identify devices
not seen during training, which makes it practical.

this work, we question some of the default choices made in literature. For
instance, we systematically study how varying similarity between the
pretraining dataset domain (textual and visual) and the downstream domain
affects performance. Surprisingly, we show that automatically generated data in
a domain closer to the downstream task (e.g., VQA v2) is a better choice for
pretraining than ""natural"" data but of a slightly different domain (e.g.,
Conceptual Captions). On the other hand, some seemingly reasonable choices of
pretraining datasets were found to be entirely ineffective for some downstream
tasks. This suggests that despite the numerous recent efforts, vision &
language pretraining does not quite work ""out of the box"" yet. Overall, as a
by-product of our study, we find that simple design choices in pretraining can

computer vision community measures progress of perception algorithms. One
reason for the ubiquity of these metrics is that they are largely
task-agnostic; we in general seek to detect zero false negatives or positives.
The downside of these metrics is that, at worst, they penalize all incorrect
detections equally without conditioning on the task or scene, and at best,
heuristics need to be chosen to ensure that different mistakes count
differently. In this paper, we propose a principled metric for 3D object
detection specifically for the task of self-driving. The core idea behind our
metric is to isolate the task of object detection and measure the impact the
produced detections would induce on the downstream task of driving. Without
hand-designing it to, we find that our metric penalizes many of the mistakes
that other metrics penalize by design. In addition, our metric downweighs
detections based on additional factors such as distance from a detection to the
ego car and the speed of the detection in intuitive ways that other detection
metrics do not. For human evaluation, we generate scenes in which standard
metrics and our metric disagree and find that humans side with our metric 79%

precision to be useful, i.e., the generated patches need to have a high
probability to be correct. However, it is fundamentally difficult to ensure the
correctness of the patches, and many tools compromise other aspects of repair
performance such as recall for an acceptable precision.
  In this paper we ask a question: can a repair tool with a low precision be
still useful? To explore this question, we propose an interactive filtering
approach to patch review, which filters out incorrect patches by asking
questions to the developers. Our intuition is that incorrect patches can still
help understand the bug. With proper tool support, the benefit outweighs the
cost even if there are many incorrect patches.
  We implemented the approach as an Eclipse plugin tool, InPaFer, and evaluated
it with a simulated experiment and a user study with 30 developers. The results
show that our approach improve the repair performance of developers, with 62.5%
more successfully repaired bugs and 25.3% less debugging time in average. In
particular, even if the generated patches are all incorrect, the performance of
the developers would not be significantly reduced, and could be improved when
some patches provide useful information for repairing, such as the faulty
location and a partial fix.

simultaneously performing double nuclear norm regularized low-rank matrix

block successive upper-bound minimization algorithm is applied to solve the
model. Subsequence convergence of our algorithm can be established, and our
algorithm converges to the coordinate-wise minimizers in some mild conditions.
Several experiments on three types of public data sets show that our algorithm
can recover a variety of low-rank tensors from significantly fewer samples than

workhorse for the past century, compressible dynamics in dense gases, solids

insight on the hydrodynamic aspect of the problems solved. Recently, Le
M\'etayer and Saurel studied a simple yet promising equation of state owing to
its ability to model both the thermal and compressibility aspects of the
medium. It is a hybrid of the Noble-Abel equation of state and the stiffened
gas model, labeled the Noble-Able Stiffened Gas (NASG) equation of state. In
the present work, we derive the closed form analytical framework for modelling
compressible flow in a medium approximated by the NASG equations of state. We
derive the expressions for the isentrope, sound speed, the isentropic exponent,
Riemann variables in the characteristic description, and jump conditions for
shocks, deflagrations and detonations. We also illustrate the usefulness by
addressing the Riemann problem. The closed form solutions generalize in a
transparent way the well-established models for a perfect gas, highlighting the

  Large-scale Social IoT","  Spatial Mobile Crowdsourcing (SMCS) can be leveraged by exploiting the
capabilities of the Social Internet-of-Things (SIoT) to execute spatial tasks.
Typically, in SMCS, a task requester aims to recruit a subset of IoT devices
and commission them to travel to the task location. However, because of the
exponential increase of IoT networks and their diversified devices (e.g.,
multiple brands, different communication channels, etc.), recruiting the
appropriate devices/workers is becoming a challenging task. To this end, in
this paper, we develop a recruitment process for SMCS platforms using automated
SIoT service discovery to select trustworthy workers satisfying the requester
requirements. The method we purpose includes mainly two stages: 1) a worker
filtering stage, aiming at reducing the workers' search space to a subset of
potential trustworthy candidates using the Louvain community detection
algorithm (CD) applied to SIoT relation graphs. Next, 2) a selection process
stage that uses an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to determine the final set of
selected devices/workers. The ILP maximizes a worker efficiency metric
incorporating the skills/specs level, recruitment cost, and trustworthiness
level of the recruited IoT devices. Selected experiments analyze the
performance of the proposed CD-ILP algorithm using a real-world dataset and
show its superiority in providing an effective recruitment strategy compared to
an existing stochastic algorithm.

information on the phases of the material at any given thermodynamic condition.
Conventional phase diagram generation involves experimentation to provide an
initial estimate of thermodynamically accessible phases, followed by use of
phenomenological models to interpolate between the available experimental data
points and extrapolate to inaccessible regions. Such an approach, combined with
first-principles calculations and data-mining techniques, has led to exhaustive
thermodynamic databases albeit at distinct thermodynamic equilibria. In
contrast, materials during their synthesis, operation, or processing, may not
reach their thermodynamic equilibrium state but, instead, remain trapped in a
local free energy minimum, that may exhibit desirable properties. Mapping these
metastable phases and their thermodynamic behavior is highly desirable but
currently lacking. Here, we introduce an automated workflow that integrates
first principles physics and atomistic simulations with machine learning (ML),
and high-performance computing to allow rapid exploration of the metastable
phases of a given elemental composition. Using a representative material,
carbon, with a vast number of metastable phases without parent in equilibrium,
we demonstrate automatic mapping of hundreds of metastable states ranging from
near equilibrium to those far-from-equilibrium. Moreover, we incorporate the
free energy calculations into a neural-network-based learning of the equations
of state that allows for construction of metastable phase diagrams. High
temperature high pressure experiments using a diamond anvil cell on graphite
sample coupled with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy are used
to validate our metastable phase predictions. Our introduced approach is
general and broadly applicable to single and multi-component systems.

the entropy production rate (EPR) of the following $d$ dimensional stochastic
differential equation \begin{equation*} d X_{t}=AX_{t} d t+\sqrt{Q} d B_{t}
\end{equation*} where $A$ is a real normal stable matrix, $Q$ is positive
definite, and the matrices $A$ and $Q$ commute. The rate function for the EPR
takes the following explicit form: \begin{equation*} I(x)=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll} x\frac{\sqrt{1+\ell_0(x)}-1}{2}+\frac 12\sum\limits_{k=1}^{d}
\left(\sqrt{\alpha_k^2- \beta_k^2\ell_0(x)}+\alpha_k\right) , & x\ge 0 , \\

eigenvalues of $A$, and $\ell_0(x)$ is the unique solution of the equation:
\begin{align*} |x|={\sqrt{1+\ell}} \times \sum_{k=1}^{d}
\frac{\beta_k^2}{\sqrt{\alpha_k^2 -\ell\beta_k^2} },\qquad -1 \le \ell<

form formulas for rate functions are rare and our work identifies an important
class of large deviation problems where such formulas are available. The
logarithmic moment generating function (the fluctuation function) $\Lambda$
associated with the LDP has a closed form (see it in the paper). The functions
$\Lambda(\lambda)$ and $ I(x)$ satisfy the Cohen-Gallavotti symmetry
properties.
  In particular, the functions $I$ and $\Lambda$ do not depend on the diffusion
matrix $Q$, and are determined completely by the real and imaginary parts of
the eigenvalues of $A$. Formally, the deterministic system with $Q=0$ has zero
EPR and thus the model exhibits a phase transition in that the EPR changes
discontinuously at $Q = 0$.

This paper uses the daily closing price data of the 28 level-1 sectors from
Shenyin \& Wanguo Securities ranging from 2000 to 2017 to study the information
transmission between different sectors. We construct information flow networks
with the sectors as the nodes and the transfer entropy between them as the
corresponding edges. Then we adopt the maximum spanning arborescence (MSA) to
extracting important information flows and the hierarchical structure of the
networks. We find that, during the whole sample period, the \textit{composite}
sector is an information source of the whole stock market, while the
\textit{non-bank financial} sector is the information sink. We also find that
the \textit{non-bank finance}, \textit{bank}, \textit{computer},
\textit{media}, \textit{real estate}, \textit{medical biology} and
\textit{non-ferrous metals} sectors appear as high-degree root nodes in the
outgoing and incoming information flow MSAs. Especially, the \textit{non-bank
finance} and \textit{bank} sectors have significantly high degrees after 2008
in the outgoing information flow networks. We uncover how stock market turmoils
affect the structure of the MSAs. Finally, we reveal the specificity of
information source and sink sectors and make a conclusion that the root node
sector as the information sink of the incoming information flow networks.
Overall, our analyses show that the structure of information flow networks
changes with time and the market exhibits a sector rotation phenomenon. Our
work has important implications for market participants and policy makers in
managing market risks and controlling the contagion of risks.

training data local, can provide privacy, security and economic benefits by
designing an effective communication protocol. However, the communication
protocol amongst different nodes could be exploited by attackers to launch data
poisoning attacks, which has been demonstrated as a big threat to most machine
learning models. In this paper, we attempt to explore the vulnerability of
federated machine learning. More specifically, we focus on attacking a
federated multi-task learning framework, which is a federated learning
framework via adopting a general multi-task learning framework to handle
statistical challenges. We formulate the problem of computing optimal poisoning
attacks on federated multi-task learning as a bilevel program that is adaptive
to arbitrary choice of target nodes and source attacking nodes. Then we propose
a novel systems-aware optimization method, ATTack on Federated Learning
(AT2FL), which is efficiency to derive the implicit gradients for poisoned
data, and further compute optimal attack strategies in the federated machine
learning. Our work is an earlier study that considers issues of data poisoning
attack for federated learning. To the end, experimental results on real-world
datasets show that federated multi-task learning model is very sensitive to
poisoning attacks, when the attackers either directly poison the target nodes
or indirectly poison the related nodes by exploiting the communication
protocol.

surge on the deployment of sensors everywhere. As a result, information
obtained from sensors has become an important source for decision making in our
daily life. Unfortunately, in most sensing applications, sensors are known to
be error-prone due to various reasons and the measurements from sensors can
also become unreliable at any unexpected time. Therefore, apart from the states
of physical processes under measurement, we believe it is highly important to
monitor the reliability of sensors as well. In this work, we propose RelSen: an
optimization-based framework for simultaneous sensor reliability monitoring and
process state estimation. In RelSen we formulate both the reliability scores of
sensors and the states of monitored processes as variables to learn via an
optimization problem only given the observed measurements from sensors. The
optimization problem is efficiently solved by utilizing the redundancy of
sensors, the correlation between multiple process states and the smoothness of
each individual process. Furthermore, we apply RelSen for sensor reliability
monitoring and process state estimation in an outdoor air pollution monitoring
system and the condition monitoring system for a cement rotary kiln.
Experimental results show that our framework can timely identify unreliable
sensors and achieve higher accuracy than several baseline methods in process
state estimation under three types of commonly observed sensor faults.

generated in early universe and a lighter dark matter particle (LDM) which is a
relativistic product due to the decay of HDM. HDMs, captured by the earth,
decay to high energy LDMs, and these particles can be measured by km$^3$

matter model is taken for LDMs to interact with nuclei via a neutral current
interaction mediated by a heavy gauge boson $Z^{\prime}$. With the different
lifetimes of decay of HDMs and Z$^{\prime}$ masses, the event rates of LDMs,
measured by IceCube, are evaluated in the energy range between 1 TeV and 100
TeV. According to the IceCube data, the upper limit for LDM fluxes is estimated
at 90\% C.L. at IceCube. Finally, it is proved that LDMs could be directly

  Optimization","  Recent works in high-dimensional model-predictive control and model-based
reinforcement learning with learned dynamics and reward models have resorted to
population-based optimization methods, such as the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM),
for planning a sequence of actions. To decide on an action to take, CEM
conducts a search for the action sequence with the highest return according to
the dynamics model and reward. Action sequences are typically randomly sampled
from an unconditional Gaussian distribution and evaluated on the environment.
This distribution is iteratively updated towards action sequences with higher
returns. However, this planning method can be very inefficient, especially for
high-dimensional action spaces. An alternative line of approaches optimize
action sequences directly via gradient descent, but are prone to local optima.
We propose a method to solve this planning problem by interleaving CEM and
gradient descent steps in optimizing the action sequence. Our experiments show
faster convergence of the proposed hybrid approach, even for high-dimensional
action spaces, avoidance of local minima, and better or equal performance to
CEM. Code accompanying the paper is available here

\mathbb{C}^d$ from $m$ noisy intensity measurements $b_j=\left\lvert \langle
\mathbf{a}_j,\mathbf{x}_0 \rangle \right\rvert^2+\eta_j, \; j=1,\ldots,m$,
where $\mathbf{a}_j \in \mathbb{C}^d$ are known measurement vectors and
$\eta=(\eta_1,\ldots,\eta_m)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is a noise vector. A
commonly used model for estimating $\mathbf{x}_0$ is the intensity-based model
$\widehat{\mathbf{x}}:=\mbox{argmin}_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{C}^d} \sum_{j=1}^m
\big(\left\lvert \langle \mathbf{a}_j,\mathbf{x} \rangle \right\rvert^2-b_j
\big)^2$. Although one has already developed many efficient algorithms to solve
the intensity-based model, there are very few results about its estimation
performance. In this paper, we focus on the estimation performance of the
intensity-based model and prove that the error bound satisfies $\min_{\theta\in
\mathbb{R}}\|\widehat{\mathbf{x}}-e^{i\theta}\mathbf{x}_0\|_2 \lesssim
\min\Big\{\frac{\sqrt{\|\eta\|_2}}{{m}^{1/4}}, \frac{\|\eta\|_2}{\|
\mathbf{x}_0\|_2 \cdot \sqrt{m}}\Big\}$ under the assumption of $m \gtrsim d$
and $\mathbf{a}_j, j=1,\ldots,m,$ being Gaussian random vectors. We also show
that the error bound is sharp. For the case where $\mathbf{x}_0$ is a
$s$-sparse signal, we present a similar result under the assumption of $m
\gtrsim s \log (ed/s)$. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first
theoretical guarantees for the intensity-based model and its sparse version.
Our proofs employ Mendelson's small ball method which can deliver an effective
lower bound on a nonnegative empirical process.

longitudinal electric field and a transverse electric field, $E_{x}$ and
$E_{y}$, induced by a longitudinal thermal gradient, respectively, are
theoretically studied in QGP at a perpendicular magnetic field placed in
$z$-axis. The calculations of associated Seebeck coefficient ($S_{xx}$) and
Nernst signal ($N$) are performed using the relativistic Boltzmann equation
under relaxation time approximation. In an isotropic QGP, the influences of
magnetic field ($B$) and quark chemical potential ($\mu_{q}$) on these
thermoelectric transport coefficients are investigated. In the presence
(absence) of weak magnetic field, we find $S_{xx}$ for a fixed $\mu_{q}$ is
negative (positive) in sign, indicating dominant carriers that convert heat
gradient to electric field are negatively (positively) charged quarks. The
absolute value of $S_{xx}$ decreases with increasing temperature. Unlike
$S_{xx}$, the sign of $N$ is dependent of charge carrier type and its thermal
behavior displays a peak structure. In the presence of strong magnetic field,
the motions of (anti-)quarks can be quantized to Landau level states, only the
Seebeck coefficient along the direction of magnetic field, $S_{zz}$, is
concentrated in this work. The results show that the value of $S_{zz}$ at a
fixed $\mu_{q}$ always remains positive. Compared to in lowest Landau level
approximation, $S_{zz}$ within the effect of higher Landau levels has a
significant enhancement eventhough the increment can be slightly suppressed as
Landau level increases. The computation of these thermoelectric transport
coefficients also extends to a medium with momentum anisotropy induced by
initial spatial expansion and strong magnetic field.

ensembles and an optomechanical system with cavity driven by two lasers with
different amplitudes. In the HURSB regime, the squeezing of the movable mirror
can not be larger than 3dB if no atomic ensemble or only one atomic ensemble is

process-centric systems. Process mining receives so-called process logs which
are collections of partially-ordered events. An event has to possess at least
three attributes, case ID, task ID and a timestamp for mining approaches to
work. When a case ID is unknown, the event is called unlabeled. Traditionally,
process mining is an offline task, where events are collected from different
sources are usually manually correlated. That is, events belonging to the same
instance are assigned the same case ID. With today's high-volume/high-speed
nature of, e.g., IoT applications, process mining shifts to be an online task.
For this, event correlation has to be automated and has to occur as the data is
generated. In this paper, we introduce an approach that correlates unlabeled
events at runtime. Given a process model, a stream of unlabeled events and
other information about task duration, our approach can induce a case
identifier to a set of unlabeled events with a trust percentage. It can also
check the conformance of the identified cases with the process model. A
prototype of the proposed approach was implemented and evaluated against
real-life and synthetic logs.

(characterized in terms of low-level features variations) and the content. For
this reason we propose to project the image features onto a space where only
the dependence from the content is kept, and then re-project this invariant
representation onto the pixel space using the target domain and style. In this
way, new labeled images can be generated which are used to train a final target
classifier. We test our approach using common MSDA benchmarks, showing that it
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

In particular, we show that accounting for system response due to inertia and

linear algebra operations. However, this strategy does not employ effectively
the extensive CPU and memory resources -- which are used only for
preprocessing, data transfer, and scheduling -- available by default on the
accelerated servers. In this paper, we study training algorithms for deep
learning on heterogeneous CPU+GPU architectures. Our two-fold objective --
maximize convergence rate and resource utilization simultaneously -- makes the
problem challenging. In order to allow for a principled exploration of the
design space, we first introduce a generic deep learning framework that
exploits the difference in computational power and memory hierarchy between CPU
and GPU through asynchronous message passing. Based on insights gained through
experimentation with the framework, we design two heterogeneous asynchronous
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms. The first algorithm -- CPU+GPU
Hogbatch -- combines small batches on CPU with large batches on GPU in order to
maximize the utilization of both resources. However, this generates an
unbalanced model update distribution which hinders the statistical convergence.
The second algorithm -- Adaptive Hogbatch -- assigns batches with continuously
evolving size based on the relative speed of CPU and GPU. This balances the
model updates ratio at the expense of a customizable decrease in utilization.
We show that the implementation of these algorithms in the proposed CPU+GPU
framework achieves both faster convergence and higher resource utilization than
TensorFlow on several real datasets and on two computing architectures -- an
on-premises server and a cloud instance.

We compare approaches based on non-convex optimization over special orthogonal

larger than a certain threshold, any naive convex relaxation fails to recover
the ground truth rotation regardless of the sample size and dimension. In
contrast, minimizing the least unsquared deviation directly over the special
orthogonal group exactly recovers the ground truth rotation for any level of

findings are supported by numerical simulations.

of their success is due to generalization from using large datasets. However,
unlike other domains, time series classification datasets are often small. In
order to address this problem, we propose a novel time series data augmentation
called guided warping. While many data augmentation methods are based on random
transformations, guided warping exploits the element alignment properties of
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and shapeDTW, a high-level DTW method based on shape
descriptors, to deterministically warp sample patterns. In this way, the time
series are mixed by warping the features of a sample pattern to match the time
steps of a reference pattern. Furthermore, we introduce a discriminative
teacher in order to serve as a directed reference for the guided warping. We
evaluate the method on all 85 datasets in the 2015 UCR Time Series Archive with
a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN).

validity of conditional information constraints ""with slack"" is in

novel augmented discriminative clustering (AD-Cluster) technique that estimates
and augments person clusters in target domains and enforces the discrimination
ability of re-ID models with the augmented clusters. AD-Cluster is trained by
iterative density-based clustering, adaptive sample augmentation, and
discriminative feature learning. It learns an image generator and a feature
encoder which aim to maximize the intra-cluster diversity in the sample space
and minimize the intra-cluster distance in the feature space in an adversarial
min-max manner. Finally, AD-Cluster increases the diversity of sample clusters
and improves the discrimination capability of re-ID models greatly. Extensive

Combining multi-scale features is one of important factors for accurate
segmentation. UNet++ was developed as a modified Unet by designing an

explore sufficient information from full scales and there is still a large room
for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel UNet 3+, which takes
advantage of full-scale skip connections and deep supervisions. The full-scale
skip connections incorporate low-level details with high-level semantics from
feature maps in different scales; while the deep supervision learns
hierarchical representations from the full-scale aggregated feature maps. The
proposed method is especially benefiting for organs that appear at varying
scales. In addition to accuracy improvements, the proposed UNet 3+ can reduce
the network parameters to improve the computation efficiency. We further
propose a hybrid loss function and devise a classification-guided module to
enhance the organ boundary and reduce the over-segmentation in a non-organ

proposed method is demonstrated on two datasets. The code is available at:

where each monochromatic edge carries a weight $\nu$. This is equivalent to
weighting each map by its Tutte polynomial, or to solving the $q$-state Potts
model on random planar maps. The associated generating function, obtained by
Olivier Bernardi and the author, is differentially algebraic. That is, it
satisfies a (non-linear) differential equation. The starting point of this
result is a functional equation written by Tutte in 1971, which translates into
enumerative terms a simple recursive description of planar maps. The proof
follows and adapts Tutte's solution of properly $q$-coloured triangulations
(1973-1984).
  We put this work in perspective with the much better understood enumeration
of families of uncoloured planar maps, for which the recursive approach almost
systematically yields algebraic generating functions. In the past 15 years,
these algebraicity properties have been explained combinatorially by
illuminating bijections between maps and families of plane trees. We survey
both approaches, recursive and bijective.
  Comparing the coloured and uncoloured results raises the question of
designing bijections for coloured maps. No complete bijective solution exists
at the moment, but we present bijections for certain specialisations of the
general problem. We also show that for these specialisations, Tutte's
functional equation is much easier to solve that in the general case.
  We conclude with some open questions.

be (extracted from the original text) matched in a semantic space. Notably,
this paradigm shift to semantic matching framework is well-grounded in our
comprehensive analysis of the inherent gap between sentence-level and

  Besides, even instantiating the framework with a simple form of a matching

cardinality. The experimental results over three datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10,

  application to HH212","  Large millimeter interferometers are revealing a growing number of rotating
outflows, which are suggested to trace magneto-centrifugal disk winds (MHD
DWs). However, their impact on disk accretion is not yet well quantified. Here
we identify systematic biases in retrieving the true launch zone, magnetic
lever arm, and angular momentum flux of an MHD DW from apparent rotation
signatures. Synthetic position-velocity cuts are constructed from self-similar
MHD DWs over a broad range of parameters, and three different methods are
applied for estimating the specific angular momentum. We find that the launch
radius inferred using the well-known relation from Anderson et al. (2006) can
markedly differ from the true outermost launch radius $r_{out}$ of the DW. The
""double-peak separation"" and ""flow width"" methods provide only a strict lower
limit to $r_{out}$. This bias is independent of angular resolution and can
reach a factor ten. In contrast, the ""rotation curve"" method gives a good
estimate of $r_{out}$ when the flow is well resolved, and an upper limit
otherwise. The magnetic lever arm is always underestimated. Only comparison
with synthetic predictions can take into account properly all observational
effects. As an application, we present a comparison with ALMA observations of
HH212 at resolutions from 250 au to 16 au, which represents the most stringent
observational test of MHD DW to date. This comparison confirms our predicted
biases for the double-peak separation method, and the large $r_{out}\sim40~$au
and small magnetic lever arm first suggested by Tabone et al. (2017). We also
derive the first accurate analytical expression for the fraction of disk
angular momentum extracted by an MHD disk wind of given radial extent, magnetic
lever arm, and mass flux. Application to HH212 confirms that MHD DWs are
serious candidates for the steady angular momentum extraction process in young
disks.

  Networks for Enhanced Physical Layer Security","  In this work, an eavesdropping-aware routing and spectrum allocation approach
is proposed utilizing network coding (NC) in elastic optical networks (EONs).
To provide physical layer security in EONs and secure the confidential
connections against eavesdropping attacks using NC, the signals of the
confidential connections are combined (XOR-ed) with other signals at different
nodes in their path, while transmitted through the network. The combination of
signals through NC significantly increases the security of confidential
connections, since an eavesdropper must access all individual signals,
traversing different links, in order to decrypt the combined signal. A novel
heuristic approach is proposed, that solves the combined network coding and
routing and spectrum allocation (NC-RSA) problem, that also takes into account
additional NC constraints that are required in order to consider a confidential
connection as secure. Different routing and spectrum allocation strategies are
proposed, aiming to maximize the level of security provided for the
confidential demands, followed by an extensive performance evaluation of each
approach in terms of the level of security provided, as well as the spectrum
utilization and blocking probability, under different network parameters.
Performance results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can provide
efficient solutions in terms of network performance, while providing the level
of security required for each demand.

health and (b) privacy shall be considered in a very carefully crafted balance,
not overruling one aspect with another one or even prioritizing certain
aspects. Privacy remains the key. Thus, the solution of the current pandemic's
data collection can be based on a fully privacy-preserving application, which
can be used by individuals on their mobile devices, such as smartphones, while
maintaining at the same time their privacy. Additionally, respective data
collected in such a fully distributed setting does help to confine the pandemic

privacy-protecting world. Therefore, the WeTrace approach and application as
described in this paper utilizes the Bluetooth Low Energy (BTE) communication
channel, many modern mobile devices offer, where asymmetric cryptography is
being applied to allows for the decyphering of a message for that destination
it had been intended for. Since literally every other potential participant
only listens to random data, even a brute force attack will not succeed.
WeTrace and its Open Source implementation is the only known approach so far,
which ensures that any receiver of a message knows that this is for him/her,

(SGMN), which performs reasoning over a semantic graph and a scene graph with
neural modules under the guidance of the linguistic structure of the

not only decodes the linguistic structure of the expression, but also has a
consistent representation with the image semantic graph. In addition to
exploring structured solutions to grounding referring expressions, we also

over the scene graphs of images using diverse expression templates and

either increases until the environment changes and the process starts to

(height, population size) of the birth-death process and the environment's
transition rates depend on the state of the birth-death process as well.
Moreover, a birth or death event may trigger an immediate change of the
environment. Our main result is an explicit expression for the stationary
distribution if the system is ergodic, providing ergodicity conditions as well.
Removing the reflecting boundary at zero we obtain a two-sided version on
$\mathbb{Z}$ of this alternating birth-death process, which for suitable
parameter constellations is ergodic as well. We determine the stationary
distribution. This two-sided version is a locally inhomogeneous discrete space
version of the classical telegraph process. We demonstrate that alternating

conductivities at $T \simeq T_c$ of $\sigma_1^{\mathrm{bl}}(\omega \rightarrow
0) \simeq$ 1\,000 $\Omega^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and
$\sigma_1^{\mathrm{int}}(\omega \rightarrow 0) \simeq$ 15
$\Omega^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, respectively, that are similar to the ones
previously found in underdoped YBCO. Different from the cuprates, we find no
evidence of a normal state pseudogap in terms of a partial suppression of the
low-energy electronic states that sets in already well above $T_c$. There is
also no clear sign of an onset of precursor superconducting pairing
correlations well above $T_c \simeq$ 30~K. This highlights that the pseudogap
and the precursor superconducting pairing well above $T_c$ are unique features
of the cuprates with their strong electronic correlations and, for example, not
just the result of a strongly anisotropic electronic response due to the
layered crystal structure.

The LLPs are produced at one experiment, but its decay products are detected by
a detector at another experiment. We use a confining Hidden Valley scenario as
a benchmark. Through showering and hadronization, the multiplicity of hidden
mesons can be large, and their decay products, dimuon as chosen in this study,
are typically too soft to pass triggers in traditional LHC searches. We find
the best acceptance is achieved if we produce LLPs at collision points at the
LHCb and ALICE experiments, and use the muon chamber of ATLAS for detection.
This new search is cost-efficient since it does not require a new detector to
be built. Meanwhile, it can provide coverage of interesting parameter space,
which is complementary to other proposed LLP searches.

computational cost and memory demand required by CFD codes may become very high

This expense is associated with the complexity of the fluid flow governing

of hypotheses that can be tested during the process of iterative design.
Therefore, we propose DeepCFD: a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model

laminar flows. The proposed model is able to learn complete solutions of the
Navier-Stokes equations, for both velocity and pressure fields, directly from

  Decision Processes with Small Treewidth","  Discrete-time Markov Chains (MCs) and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are
two standard formalisms in system analysis. Their main associated quantitative
objectives are hitting probabilities, discounted sum, and mean payoff. Although
there are many techniques for computing these objectives in general MCs/MDPs,
they have not been thoroughly studied in terms of parameterized algorithms,
particularly when treewidth is used as the parameter. This is in sharp contrast
to qualitative objectives for MCs, MDPs and graph games, for which
treewidth-based algorithms yield significant complexity improvements.
  In this work, we show that treewidth can also be used to obtain faster
algorithms for the quantitative problems. For an MC with $n$ states and $m$
transitions, we show that each of the classical quantitative objectives can be
computed in $O((n+m)\cdot t^2)$ time, given a tree decomposition of the MC that
has width $t$. Our results also imply a bound of $O(\kappa\cdot (n+m)\cdot
t^2)$ for each objective on MDPs, where $\kappa$ is the number of
strategy-iteration refinements required for the given input and objective.
Finally, we make an experimental evaluation of our new algorithms on
low-treewidth MCs and MDPs obtained from the DaCapo benchmark suite. Our
experimental results show that on MCs and MDPs with small treewidth, our
algorithms outperform existing well-established methods by one or more orders
of magnitude.

However, dual-system approaches fail to consider the reliability of the learned
model when it is applied to make multiple-step predictions, resulting in a
compounding of prediction errors and performance degradation. In this paper, we
present a novel dual-system motor learning approach where a meta-controller
arbitrates online between model-based and model-free decisions based on an
estimate of the local reliability of the learned model. The reliability
estimate is used in computing an intrinsic feedback signal, encouraging actions
that lead to data that improves the model. Our approach also integrates
arbitration with imagination where a learned latent-space model generates
imagined experiences, based on its local reliability, to be used as additional
training data. We evaluate our approach against baseline and state-of-the-art

The results show that our approach outperforms the compared methods and learns

convection between horizontal no-slip, permeable walls with a distance $H$ and
a constant temperature difference $\Delta T$ at the Rayleigh number
$Ra=3\times10^{3}-10^{10}$. On the no-slip wall surfaces $z=0$, $H$ the
wall-normal (vertical) transpiration velocity is assumed to be proportional to
the local pressure fluctuation, i.e. $w=-\beta p'/\rho, +\beta p'/\rho$
(Jim\'enez et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 442, 2001, pp. 89-117), and the
property of the permeable wall is given by the permeability parameter $\beta U$
normalised with the buoyancy-induced terminal velocity $U={(g\alpha\Delta
TH)}^{1/2}$, where $\rho$, $g$ and $\alpha$ are mass density, acceleration due
to gravity and volumetric thermal expansivity, respectively. A zero net mass
flux through the wall is instantaneously ensured, and thermal convection is
driven only by buoyancy without any additional energy inputs. The critical
transition of heat transfer in convective turbulence has been found between the
two $Ra$ regimes for fixed $\beta U=3$ and fixed Prandtl number $Pr=1$. In the
subcritical regime at lower $Ra$ the Nusselt number $Nu$ scales with $Ra$ as
$Nu\sim Ra^{1/3}$, as commonly observed in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection. In the supercritical regime at higher $Ra$, on the other hand, the
ultimate scaling $Nu\sim Ra^{1/2}$ is achieved, meaning that the wall-to-wall
heat flux scales with $U\Delta T$ independent of the thermal diffusivity,
although the heat transfer on the wall is dominated by thermal conduction. The
physical mechanisms of the achievement of the ultimate heat transfer are
presented.

electroweak (EW) corrections together with soft and hard QED radiation. The
numerical evaluation is carried out for three different scenarios, so-called
non-alignment, low-$m_H$ and short-cascade, defined in the presence of the
up-to-date experimental constraints and consistent with theoretical constraints
as well. The total cross sections of $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow H^{-}H^{+}$ are
scanned over the plane ($m_{\phi^0},\sqrt{s}$), where $\phi^0$ is $h^0$ for
low-$m_{H^0}$ scenario and $H^0$ for other two scenarios. The regions of the
parameter space in which the production rates are sufficiently large are
highlighted for each scenario. The production rates in different polarization
collision modes of initial beams are also discussed. It can be enhanced up to
two-times by oppositely polarized photons at high energies and right-handed
polarized photons at low energies. Furthermore, decay channels of the charged
Higgs boson are examined for each scenario. It is observed that the one-loop EW
corrections, i.e., the virtual plus real radiation corrections, reduce the
tree-level cross sections and the relative correction is typically in the range
of $-10\%$ to $-30\%$, depending on model parameters.

of the variability-selected AGNs are individually identified with the X-ray
sources detected in the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey. We investigate their
properties in variability by using structure function analysis and find that
the structure function for low-luminosity AGNs
($L_{\mathrm{bol}}\lesssim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) shows a positive correlation
with luminosity, which is the opposite trend for the luminous quasars. This
trend is likely to be caused by larger contribution of the host galaxy light
for lower-luminosity AGNs. Using the model templates of galaxy spectra, we
evaluate the amount of host galaxy contribution to the structure function
analysis and find that dominance of the young stellar population is needed to
explain the observed luminosity dependence. This suggests that low-luminosity
AGNs at $0.8\lesssim z\lesssim1.8$ are predominantly hosted in star-forming
galaxies. The X-ray stacking analysis reveals the significant emission from the
individually X-ray undetected AGNs in our variability-selected sample. The
stacked samples show very large hardness ratios in their stacked X-ray
spectrum, which suggests that these optically variable sources have large soft
X-ray absorption by dust-free gas.

  Transformation","  In the software development process, model transformation is increasingly
assimilated. However, systems being developed with model transformation
sometimes grow in size and become complex. Meanwhile, the performance of model
transformation tends to decrease. Hence, performance is an important quality of
model transformation. According to current research model transformation
performance focuses on optimising the engines internally. However, there exists
no research activities to support transformation engineer to identify
performance bottleneck in the transformation rules and hence, to predict the
overall performance. In this paper we vision our aim at providing an approach
of monitoring and profiling to identify the root cause of performance issues in
the transformation rules and to predict the performance of model
transformation. This will enable software engineers to systematically identify
performance issues as well as predict the performance of model transformation.

  magnetically driven disk winds","  We discovered a new growth mode of dust grains to km-sized bodies in
protoplanetary disks that evolve by viscous accretion and magnetically driven
disk winds (MDWs). We solved an approximate coagulation equation of dust grains
with time-evolving disks that consist of both gas and solid components by a one
dimensional model. With the collisional growth of dust grains, all solid
particles initially drift inward toward the central star by the gas drag force.
However, the radial profile of gas pressure, $P$, is modified by the MDW that
disperses the gas in an inside-out manner. As a result, a local concentration
of solid particles is created by the converging radial flux of drifting dust
grains at the location with the convex upward profile of $P$. When the
dimensionless stopping time, or the Stokes number, St, there exceeds unity, the
solid particles spontaneously reach the growth dominated state because of the
positive feedback between the suppressed radial drift and the enhanced
accumulation of dust particles that drift from the outer part. These
consecutive processes proceed even for spherical dust grains under the Epstein
gas drag. Once the solid particles are in the drift limited state, the above
mentioned condition of St $\gtrsim 1$ for the dust growth is equivalent with
\begin{equation}
  \Sigma_{\rm d}/\Sigma_{\rm g} \gtrsim \eta, \nonumber \end{equation} where
$\Sigma_{\rm d}/\Sigma_{\rm g}$ is the dust-to-gas surface-density ratio and
$\eta$ is dimensionless radial pressure-gradient force. As a consequence of the
successful growth of dust grains, a ring-like structure containing
planetesimal-sized bodies is formed at the inner part of the protoplanetary
disks. Such a ring-shaped concentration of planetesimals is expected to play a
vital role in the subsequent planet formation.

decreasing cannot be reliably calculated before it is actually attained. A
standard SIR model with confinement shows that infection spread is inhibited
only above a threshold. Confinement induces a slow-down in the expansion phase
that does not guarantee an eventual control of the epidemic. A Bayesian fit to
the on-going COVID-19 pandemic in Spain shows that we can infer neither its

rate. Standard models, e.g., the SIR model, have stressed on the importance of
finding the susceptible cases to flatten the growth rate of the spread of
infection as early as possible. In the present scientific world, location
traces in the form of GPS coordinates are logged by mobile device manufacturing
and their operating systems developing companies, such as Apple, Samsung,
Google etc. However, due to the sensitive nature of this data, it is usually
not shared with other organisations, mainly to protect individual privacy.
However, in disaster situations, such as epidemics, data in the form of
location traces of a community of people can potentially be helpful to
proactively locate susceptible people from the community and enforce quarantine
on them as early as possible.
  Since procuring such data for the purpose of restricted use is difficult
(time-consuming) due to the sensitive nature of the data, a strong case needs
to be made that how could such data be useful in disaster situations. The aim
of this article is to to demonstrate a proof-of-the-concept that with the
availability of massive amounts of real check-in data, it is feasible to
develop a scalable system that is both effective (in terms of identifying the
susceptible people) and efficient (in terms of the time taken to do so). We
believe that this proof-of-the-concept will encourage sharing (with restricted
use) of such sensitive data in order to help mitigate disaster situations.

small run-time) locate a set of susceptible persons given a global database of

nodes want to communicate each other in a unit disk while keeping the presence
of the communication secret from each of $\Theta(n^s)$ non-colluding wardens
($s>0$). Our results show that the node mobility greatly improves the
throughput scaling, compared to the case of fixed node location. In particular,
for $0<s<1$, the aggregate throughput scaling is shown to be linear in $n$ when
the number of channel uses that each warden uses to judge the presence of

modify the two-hop based scheme by Grossglauser and Tse (2002), which was
proposed for a wireless ad hoc network without a covertness constraint, by
introducing a preservation region around each warden in which the senders are
not allowed to transmit and by carefully analyzing the effect of covertness

scheme is shown to be optimal for $0<s<1$ under an assumption that each node

IoV simulates a large variety of crowdsourcing applications such as Waze, Uber,

real-time traffic information to the cloud server which trains a machine
learning model based on traffic information reported by users for intelligent
traffic management. However, crowdsourcing application owners can easily infer
users' location information, which raises severe location privacy concerns of
the users. In addition, as the number of vehicles increases, the frequent
communication between vehicles and the cloud server incurs unexpected amount of
communication cost. To avoid the privacy threat and reduce the communication
cost, in this paper, we propose to integrate federated learning and local
differential privacy (LDP) to facilitate the crowdsourcing applications to
achieve the machine learning model. Specifically, we propose four LDP
mechanisms to perturb gradients generated by vehicles. The Three-Outputs
mechanism is proposed which introduces three different output possibilities to
deliver a high accuracy when the privacy budget is small. The output
possibilities of Three-Outputs can be encoded with two bits to reduce the
communication cost. Besides, to maximize the performance when the privacy
budget is large, an optimal piecewise mechanism (PM-OPT) is proposed. We
further propose a suboptimal mechanism (PM-SUB) with a simple formula and
comparable utility to PM-OPT. Then, we build a novel hybrid mechanism by
combining Three-Outputs and PM-SUB.

special kinds of bumblebee vector fields in a Kerr black hole spacetime and
find that the propagation of light depends on its polarization due to the
birefringence phenomenon. The dependence of black hole shadow on the light's
polarization is dominated by the form of bumblebee vector field itself. In the
both cases $A$ ($b^{\mu}=(0,\frac{\sqrt{\Delta}}{\rho},0,0)$) and $B$ (
$b^{\mu}=(0,0,\frac{1}{\rho},0)$), we find that the black hole shadow is
independent of the polarization of light. However, the status is changed in the
case $C$, i.e.,
$b^{\mu}=(0,\frac{\sqrt{2\Delta}}{2\rho},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2\rho},0)$, in which
the black hole shadow depends on the light's polarization and the coupling
between bumblebee vector field and electromagnetic field. These features of
black hole shadow casted by polarization lights could help to understand the

India. The detailed age-structured compartment-based model endogenously
captures various disease transmission pathways, expanding significantly from
the standard SEIR model. The model is customized for India by using the
appropriate population pyramid, contact rate matrices, external arrivals (as
per actual data), and a few other calibrated fractions based on the reported
cases of Covid-19 in India. Also, we have explicitly modeled, using independent
time-variant levers, the effects of testing, contact tracing, isolating
Covid-positive patients, quarantining, use of mask/better hygiene practices,
social distancing through contact rate reductions at distinct zones of home(H),
work(W), school(S) and other(O) locations. Simulation results show that, even
after an extended lock-down, some non-trivial number of infections (even
asymptomatic) will be left and the pandemic will resurface. Only tools that
work against the pandemic is high rate of testing of those who show Covid-19
like symptoms, isolating them if they are positive and contact tracing all
contacts of positive patients and quarantining them, in combination with use of
face masks and personal hygiene. A wide range of combination of effectiveness
of contact tracing, isolation, quarantining and personal hygiene measures help
minimize the pandemic impact and some imperfections in implementation of one
measure can be compensated by better implementation of other measures.

``knowledge'' learned by one machine learning model (the \textit{teacher}) into
another model (the \textit{student}), where typically, the teacher has a
greater capacity (e.g., more parameters or higher bit-widths). To our
knowledge, existing methods overlook the fact that although the student absorbs
extra knowledge from the teacher, both models share the same input data -- and
this data is the only medium by which the teacher's knowledge can be
demonstrated. Due to the difference in model capacities, the student may not
benefit fully from the same data points on which the teacher is trained. On the
other hand, a human teacher may demonstrate a piece of knowledge with
individualized examples adapted to a particular student, for instance, in terms
of her cultural background and interests. Inspired by this behavior, we design
data augmentation agents with distinct roles to facilitate knowledge
distillation. Our data augmentation agents generate distinct training data for
the teacher and student, respectively. We find empirically that specially
tailored data points enable the teacher's knowledge to be demonstrated more
effectively to the student. We compare our approach with existing KD methods on
training popular neural architectures and demonstrate that role-wise data
augmentation improves the effectiveness of KD over strong prior approaches. The

  layer","  Large-scale motions, also known as superstructures, are dynamically relevant
coherent structures in a wall-bounded turbulent flow, that span the entire
domain in wall-normal direction and significantly contribute to the global
energy and momentum transport. Recent investigations in channel and Couette
flow, suggest that these large-scale motions are self-sustained, implying they
are not driven by small-scale motions at the wall. Whether large-scale motions
are self-sustained has however not yet been answered for open boundary layers,
which are relevant for many applications. Here, using the asymptotic suction
boundary layer flow at the friction Reynolds number $Re_\tau = 1\,168$ as a
testbed, we show that large-scale motions are self-sustained also in boundary
layers. Together with the previous investigations in confined flows, this
observation provides strong evidence of the robust and general nature of
coherent self-sustained processes in turbulent wall-bounded flows. The dynamics
of the large-scale self-sustained process involving the growth, breakdown and
regeneration of quasi-streamwise coherent streaks and vortices within the
boundary layer shows temporal phase relations reminiscent of bursting as
observed in buffer layer structures. The dynamics however differs from the
quasi-periodic large-scale streak-vortex regeneration cycle observed in
confined flows. Based on the similarity of the dynamics of large-scale motions
in boundary layers and of small-scale buffer layer structures, we conjecture
that the bursting behaviour is associated with the dynamical relevance of only
one wall, while two confining walls lead to the quasi-periodic cycle.

  Closure","  Despite their well-known limitations, RANS models remain the most commonly
employed tool for modeling turbulent flows in engineering practice. RANS models
are predicated on the solution of the RANS equations, but these equations
involve an unclosed term, the Reynolds stress tensor, which must be modeled.
The Reynolds stress tensor is often modeled as an algebraic function of mean
flow field variables and turbulence variables. This introduces a discrepancy
between the Reynolds stress tensor predicted by the model and the exact
Reynolds stress tensor. This discrepancy can result in inaccurate mean flow
field predictions. In this paper, we introduce a data-informed approach for
arriving at Reynolds stress models with improved predictive performance. Our
approach relies on learning the components of the Reynolds stress discrepancy
tensor associated with a given Reynolds stress model in the mean strain-rate
tensor eigenframe. These components are typically smooth and hence simple to
learn using state-of-the-art machine learning strategies and regression
techniques. Our approach automatically yields Reynolds stress models that are
symmetric, and it yields Reynolds stress models that are both Galilean and
frame invariant provided the inputs are themselves Galilean and frame
invariant. To arrive at computable models of the discrepancy tensor, we employ
feed-forward neural networks and an input space spanning the integrity basis of
the mean strain-rate tensor, the mean rotation-rate tensor, the mean pressure
gradient, and the turbulent kinetic energy gradient, and we introduce a
framework for dimensional reduction of the input space to further reduce
computational cost. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach for data-informed Reynolds stress closure for a suite of
turbulent flow problems of increasing complexity.

in-orbit mass is necessary. However, the quest for an optimal solution does not
have a unique answer and the available data often lacks coherence. To improve
this situation, modern knowledge representation techniques, that have been
shaping the World Wide Web, medicine and pharmacy, should be employed. Prior
efforts in the domain of space debris have only focused onto space situational
awareness, neglecting ADR. To bridge this gap we present a domain-ontology of
intact derelict objects, i.e. payloads and rocket bodies, for ADR capture
methods selection. The ontology is defined on a minimal set of physical,
dynamical and statistical parameters of a target object. The practicality and
validity of the ontology are demonstrated by applying it onto a database of 30
representative objects, built by combining structured and unstructured data
from publicly available sources. The analysis of results proves the ontology
capable of inferring the most suited ADR capture methods for considered
objects. Furthermore, it confirms its ability to handle the input data from
different sources transparently, minimizing user input. The developed ontology
provides an initial step towards a more comprehensive knowledge representation
framework meant to improve data management and knowledge discovery in the
domain of space debris. Furthermore, it provides a tool that should make the
initial planning of future ADR missions simpler yet more systematic.

distribution $\pi$ and a source distribution $p_z$ both defined on
$\mathbb{R}^d$, we prove under some assumptions that there exists a deep neural
network $g:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with ReLU activation such that
the push-forward measure $(\nabla g)_\# p_z$ of $p_z$ under the map $\nabla g$
is arbitrarily close to the target measure $\pi$. The closeness are measured by
three classes of integral probability metrics between probability
distributions: $1$-Wasserstein distance, maximum mean distance (MMD) and
kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD). We prove upper bounds for the size (width
and depth) of the deep neural network in terms of the dimension $d$ and the
approximation error $\varepsilon$ with respect to the three discrepancies. In
particular, the size of neural network can grow exponentially in $d$ when
$1$-Wasserstein distance is used as the discrepancy, whereas for both MMD and
KSD the size of neural network only depends on $d$ at most polynomially. Our
proof relies on convergence estimates of empirical measures under
aforementioned discrepancies and semi-discrete optimal transport.

  states","  We have investigated how a strong magnetic field (B) could decipher the
anisotropic interaction in heavy quark ($Q$) and antiquark ($\bar Q$) bound
states through the perturbative thermal QCD in real-time formalism. So we
thermalize Schwinger propagator for quarks in LLL and the Feynman propagator
for gluons to calculate the gluon self-energy. For the quark-loop contribution
to the self-energy, the medium does not have any temperature correction and the
vacuum term gives rise an anisotropic term whereas the gluon-loop yields
temperature correction. This finding in quark-loop contribution corroborates
the equivalence of a massless QED in (1+1)-dimension with the massless thermal
QCD in strong B, which (quark sector) is reduced to (1+1)-dimension
(longitudinal). Thus the permittivity of the medium behaves like as a tensor.
Thus the permittivity of medium makes the $Q \bar Q$ potential anisotropic,
which resembles with a contemporary results found in lattice studies. As a
result, potential for $Q \bar Q$-pairs aligned transverse to B is more
attractive than parallel alignment. However, potential is always more
attractive compared to B=0 due to softening of screening mass. However, the
imaginary-part of potential becomes smaller compared to B=0. We have next
investigated the effects of strong ${\bf B}$ on binding energies (B.E.) and
thermal widths ($\Gamma$) of ground states of $c \bar c$ and $b \bar b$ in a
time-independent perturbation theory, where binding energies gets increased and
widths gets decreased, compared to $B =0$. Finally we have studied the
quasi-free dissociation of bound states in a strong B. The dissociation
temperatures estimated for $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ states are obtained as $1.59
\rm{T_c} $ and $2.22 \rm{T_c}$, respectively, which are higher than the
estimate in B=0 , thus preventing early dissolution of $Q \bar Q$ bound states.

variational model of brittle fracture in linear elasticity, and to study the
$\Gamma$-limit of the functional as the thickness tends to zero. The numerical
discretization is tackled by first approximating the fracture through a phase
field, following an Ambrosio-Tortorelli like approach, and then resorting to an
alternating minimization procedure, where the irreversibility of the crack
propagation is rigorously imposed via an inequality constraint. The
minimization is enriched with an anisotropic mesh adaptation driven by an a
posteriori error estimator, which allows us to sharply track the whole crack
path by optimizing the shape, the size, and the orientation of the mesh
elements. Finally, the overall algorithm is successfully assessed on two
Riemannian settings and proves not to bias the crack propagation.

extending the low-rank approximation pursuit (LRAP) method for matrix
completions to tensor completions. The method performs a tensor factorization
using the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) which extends the
standard matrix SVD to tensors. The t-SVD leads to a notion of rank, called
tubal-rank here. We want to recreate the data in tensors from low resolution
samples as best we can here. To complete a low resolution tensor successfully
we assume that the given tensor data has low tubal-rank. For tensors of low
tubal-rank, we establish convergence results for our method that are based on
the tensor restricted isometry property (TRIP). Our result with the TRIP
condition for tensors is similar to low-rank matrix completions under the RIP
condition. The TRIP condition uses the t-SVD for low tubal-rank tensors, while
RIP uses the SVD for matrices. We show that a subgaussian measurement map
satisfies the TRIP condition with high probability and gives an almost optimal
bound on the number of required measurements. We compare the numerical
performance of the proposed algorithm with those for state-of-the-art
approaches on video recovery and color image recovery.

well-established techniques can run into trouble (or even catastrophically

source domain to a new target domain with only unlabeled data. The main
challenge to UDA lies in how to reduce the domain gap between the source domain
and the target domain. Existing approaches of cross-domain semantic
segmentation usually employ a consistency regularization on the target
prediction of student model and teacher model respectively under different
perturbations. However, previous works do not consider the reliability of the
predicted target samples, which could harm the learning process by generating
unreasonable guidance for the student model. In this paper, we propose an
uncertainty-aware consistency regularization method to tackle this issue for
semantic segmentation. By exploiting the latent uncertainty information of the
target samples, more meaningful and reliable knowledge from the teacher model
would be transferred to the student model. The experimental evaluation has
shown that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by

overabundances of exotic elements and, similar to magnetic Ap/Bp stars, are
spectrum variables, implying the presence of an inhomogeneous element
distribution over the stellar surface. A number of magnetic field studies have
been attempted in the last decades, indicating that magnetic fields in HgMn
stars, if they exist, should be rather weak. The presence of tangled magnetic
fields was suggested by several authors who detected quadratic magnetic fields
using the moment technique. We employ the least-squares deconvolution technique
to carry out a sensitive search for weak magnetic fields in spectropolarimetric
observations of three HgMn stars, HD221507, HD65949, and HD101189, which have
different fundamental parameters and spectral characteristics. A definite weak
longitudinal field is discovered in HD221507 and HD65949 on single epochs,
while only marginal field detections were achieved for HD101189. The new
measurements indicate that the structure of the magnetic fields is probably
rather complex: our analysis reveals the presence of reversed Stokes V profiles
at the same observational epoch if individual elements are used in the
measurements. This is the first observational evidence that individual elements
sample distinct local magnetic fields of different polarity across the stellar
surface.

function $Y_H(z)=\frac{\rho_{DE}}{\rho_m^{(0)}}$, which is a function of the
redshift and of the Hubble rate. By appropriately rewriting the Friedmann
equation in terms of the redshift and of the function $Y_H(z)$, we numerically
solve it using appropriate initial conditions, and we critically examine the
effects of the $k$-Essence higher order kinetic terms. As we demonstrate, the
effect of the higher order scalar field kinetic terms on the late-time dynamics
is radical, since the dark energy oscillations are absent, and in addition, the
cosmological physical quantities are compatible with the latest Planck data and
also the model is almost indistinguishable from the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter
model. This is in contrast to the standard $f(R)$ gravity case, where the
oscillations are present. Furthermore, by choosing a different set of values of
two of the free parameters of the model, and specifically the coefficient of
the higher order kinetic term and of the exponent of $R^{\delta}$ appearing in
the $f(R)$ action, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain $\rho_{DE}<0$

less effort in fine-tuning to adapt to the dynamic nature of WSN. This method
benefits from the cooperation of clustering and classification modules to
iteratively decrease the required number of data in a typical supervised

massively distributed IoT (i.e., sensor networks), where it can prolong the

to explain and interpret the learning process and the model decision remains an
open problem. This study proposes an interpretable deep learning model -- a
biologically interpretable two-stage deep neural network (BIT-DNN), by
integrating biochemical and biophysical associated information into the
proposed framework, capable of achieving both high accuracy and

introduces a two-stage feature learning process. In the first stage, an
enhanced interpretable feature block extracts low-level spectral features
associated with the biophysical and biochemical attributes of the target
entities; and in the second stage, an interpretable capsule block extracts and
encapsulates the high-level joint spectral-spatial features into the featured
tensors representing the hierarchical structure of the biophysical and
biochemical attributes of the target ground entities, which provides the model
an improved performance on classification and intrinsic interpretability. We
have tested and evaluated the model using two real HSI datasets for crop type

  Emerging Applications","  Differential privacy (DP) has arisen as the state-of-the-art metric for
quantifying individual privacy when sensitive data are analyzed, and it is
starting to see practical deployment in organizations such as the US Census
Bureau, Apple, Google, etc. There are two popular models for deploying
differential privacy - standard differential privacy (SDP), where a trusted
server aggregates all the data and runs the DP mechanisms, and local
differential privacy (LDP), where each user perturbs their own data and
perturbed data is analyzed. Due to security concerns arising from aggregating
raw data at a single server, several real world deployments in industry have
embraced the LDP model. However, systems based on the LDP model tend to have
poor utility - ""a gap"" in the utility achieved as compared to systems based on
the SDP model.
  In this work, we survey and synthesize emerging directions of research at the
intersection of differential privacy and cryptography. First, we survey
solutions that combine cryptographic primitives like secure computation and
anonymous communication with differential privacy to give alternatives to the
LDP model that avoid a trusted server as in SDP but close the gap in accuracy.
These primitives introduce performance bottlenecks and necessitate efficient
alternatives. Second, we synthesize work in an area we call ""DP-Cryptography"" -
cryptographic primitives that are allowed to leak differentially private
outputs. These primitives have orders of magnitude better performance than
standard cryptographic primitives. DP-cryptographic primitives are perfectly
suited for implementing alternatives to LDP, but are also applicable to
scenarios where standard cryptographic primitives do not have practical
implementations. Through this unique lens of research taxonomy, we survey
ongoing research in these directions while also providing novel directions for
future research.

where the observables are expressed as bilinear products of the independent

  antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$","  The discovery of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in bulk metallic
antiferromagnets (AFMs) motivates the search of the same phenomenon in
two-dimensional (2D) systems, where a quantized anomalous Hall conductance can
in principle be observed. Here, we present experiments on micro-fabricated
devices based on Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$, a layered AFM that was recently found to
exhibit AHE in bulk crystals below the N\'eel temperature T$_N$ = 29 K.
Transport measurements reveal a pronounced resistivity anisotropy, indicating
that upon lowering temperature the electronic coupling between individual
atomic layers is increasingly suppressed. The experiments also show an
extremely large anomalous Hall conductivity of approximately 400 S/cm, more
than one order of magnitude larger than in the bulk, which demonstrates the
importance of studying the AHE in small exfoliated crystals, less affected by
crystalline defects. Interestingly, the corresponding anomalous Hall
conductance, when normalized to the number of contributing atomic planes, is
$\sim \, 0.6 \; e^2/h$ per layer, approaching the value expected for the
quantized anomalous Hall effect. The observed strong anisotropy of transport
and the very large anomalous Hall conductance per layer make the properties of
Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ compatible with the presence of partially filled
topologically non-trivial 2D bands originating from the magnetic superstructure
of the antiferromagnetic state. Isolating atomically thin layers of this
material and controlling their charge density may therefore provide a viable
route to reveal the occurrence of the quantized AHE in a 2D AFM.

when presented with a patient with a combination of traits, a doctor may wonder
if a certain combination of symptoms may be especially predictive, such as the

  Radios","  In this work, we address reliable communication of low-latency packets in the
presence of a full-duplex adversary that is capable of executing a jamming
attack while also being able to measure the power levels on various frequency
bands. Due to the presence of a strong adversary, first, we point out that
traditional frequency-hopping does not help since unused frequency bands may
not be available, and moreover, the victim's transition between the frequency
bands would be detected by the full-duplex adversary. Identifying these
challenges, we propose a new cooperative mitigation strategy, referred to as
the Semi-Coherent Fast-Forward Full-Duplex (SC-FFFD) relaying technique,
wherein the victim node, upon switching to a new frequency band, seeks the
assistance of its incumbent user, which is also a full-duplex radio, to
instantaneously forward its messages to the destination using a portion of
their powers. Meanwhile, the two nodes cooperatively use their residual powers
on the jammed frequency band so as to engage the adversary to continue
executing the jamming attack on the same band. Using on-off keying (OOK) and
phase-shift-keying (PSK) as the modulation schemes at the victim and the helper
node, respectively, we derive upper bounds on the probability of error of
jointly decoding the information symbols of the two nodes, and subsequently
derive analytical solutions to arrive at the power-splitting factor between the
two frequency bands to minimize the error of both the nodes. We also present
extensive simulation results for various signal-to-noise-ratio values and PSK
constellations to showcase the efficacy of the proposed approach.

topology, combined with our access to precision tracking and manipulation
approaches, has triggered a fresh appreciation of topological ramifications,
specifically in mediating key functions in biological systems spanning orders
of magnitude in length and time scales. Microbial ecosystems, a frequently
encountered example of living matter, offer a rich test bed where the role of
topological defects and their mechanics can be explored in the context of
microbial composition, structure and functions. Emergent processes, triggered
by anisotropy and activity characteristic of such structured,
out-of-equilibrium systems, underpin fundamental properties in microbial
systems. An inevitable consequence of anisotropy is the long-range
orientational (or positional) correlations, which give rise to topological
defects nucleating due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The scene stealer of
this emerging cross-disciplinary field is the topological defects:
singularities embedded within the material field that elicit novel, if not
unexpected, dynamics that are at the heart of active processes underpinning
soft and living matter systems. In this short review, I have put together a
summary of the key recent advances that highlight the interface of liquid
crystal physics and the physical ecology of microbes; and combined it with
original experimental data on sessile species as a case to demonstrate how this
interface offers a biophysical framework that could help to decode and harness
active microbial processes in 'true' ecological settings. Topology and its

including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
Although CNN hardware accelerators are already included as part of many SoC
architectures, the task of achieving high accuracy on resource-restricted
devices is still considered challenging, mainly due to the vast number of
design parameters that need to be balanced to achieve an efficient solution.
Quantization techniques, when applied to the network parameters, lead to a
reduction of power and area and may also change the ratio between communication
and computation. As a result, some algorithmic solutions may suffer from lack
of memory bandwidth or computational resources and fail to achieve the expected
performance due to hardware constraints. Thus, the system designer and the
micro-architect need to understand at early development stages the impact of
their high-level decisions (e.g., the architecture of the CNN and the amount of
bits used to represent its parameters) on the final product (e.g., the expected
power saving, area, and accuracy). Unfortunately, existing tools fall short of
supporting such decisions.
  This paper introduces a hardware-aware complexity metric that aims to assist
the system designer of the neural network architectures, through the entire
project lifetime (especially at its early stages) by predicting the impact of
architectural and micro-architectural decisions on the final product. We
demonstrate how the proposed metric can help evaluate different design
alternatives of neural network models on resource-restricted devices such as
real-time embedded systems, and to avoid making design mistakes at early
stages.

this is only one facet of the notion of unpredictability pioneered by Lorenz,
who actually predicted that multiscale fluid flows could spontaneously lose
their deterministic nature and become intrinsically random. This effect, which
is radically different from chaos, have remained out of reach for detailed
physical observations. Here, we substantiate this scenario by showing that it
is inherent to the elementary Kelvin--Helmholtz hydrodynamical instability of
an initially singular shear layer. We moreover provide evidence that the
resulting macroscopic flow displays universal statistical properties that are
triggered by, but independent of specific physical properties at micro-scales.
This spontaneous stochasticity is interpreted as an Eulerian counterpart to
Richardson's relative dispersion of Lagrangian particles, giving substance to
the intrinsic nature of randomness in turbulence.

variable stars during its lifetime. We analyze the short-cadence K2 light curve
of one of those systems, Tau 4 (RX J0502.8+1624), which underwent a
serendipitous jump from a low-accretion state into a high state during the
final days of the observation. Apart from one brief flare, there was no
evidence of accretion during the 70 d of observations of the low state. As Tau
4 transitioned into a high state, the resumption of accretion was very gradual,
taking approximately six days (~90 binary orbits). We supplement Tau 4's K2
light curve with time-resolved spectroscopy obtained in both high and low
states of accretion. High-excitation lines, such as He II 468.6 nm, were
extraordinarily weak, even when the system was actively accreting. This
strongly suggests the absence of an accretion shock, placing Tau 4 in the
bombardment regime predicted for AM Herculis systems with low accretion rates.
In both the high-state and low-state spectra, Zeeman absorption features from
the white dwarf's photosphere are present and reveal a surface-averaged field
strength of $15\pm2$ MG. Remarkably, the high-state spectra also show
Zeeman-split emission lines produced in a region with a field strength of
$12\pm1$ MG. Zeeman emission has not been previously reported in an AM Herculis
system, and we propose that the phenomenon is caused by a temperature inversion
in the WD's atmosphere near the accretion region.

each round, a mechanism assigns an allocation each to a set of agents and
charges them a price. Then the agents report their realised (stochastic) values
back to the mechanism. This is motivated by applications in cloud markets and
online advertising where an agent may know her value for an allocation only
after experiencing it. The distribution of these values is unknown to the agent
beforehand which necessitates learning them over multiple rounds while
simultaneously attempting to find the socially optimal set of allocations. Our
focus is on designing truthful and individually rational mechanisms which
imitate the classical VCG mechanism in the long run. To that end, we define
three notions of regret for the welfare, the individual utilities of each agent
(value minus price) and that of the mechanism (revenue minus cost). We show
that these three terms are interdependent via an $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower bound
for the maximum of these three terms after $T$ rounds of allocations. We
describe a family of anytime algorithms which achieve this rate. The proposed
framework provides flexibility to control the pricing scheme so as to trade-off
between the agent and seller regrets, and additionally to control the degree of
truthfulness and individual rationality.

Autoencoders address this challenge by mapping trees to a vectorial latent
space, where tasks are easier to solve, and then mapping the solution back to a
tree structure. However, existing autoencoding approaches for tree data fail to
take the specific grammatical structure of tree domains into account and rely
on deep learning, thus requiring large training datasets and long training

spectral variation from HD-EEG to assess changes in cortical activity during
adaptation and habituation to postural perturbation. To evoke proprioceptive
postural perturbation, vibratory stimulation at 85 Hz was applied to the calf
muscles of 33 subjects over four 75-second stimulation periods. Stimulation was
performed according to a pseudorandom binary sequence. Vibratory impulses were
synchronized to high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG, 256 channels).
Changes in absolute spectral power (ASP) were analyzed over four frequency
bands (Delta: 0.5-3.5 Hz; theta: 3.5-7.5 Hz; alpha: 7.5-12.5 Hz; beta:12.5-30
Hz). A force platform recorded torque actuated by the feet, and normalized sway
path length (SPL) was computed as a construct for postural performance during
each period. SPL values indicated improvement in postural performance over the
trial periods. Significant variation in absolute power values (ASP) was found
in assessing postural adaptation: an increase in theta band ASP in the
frontal-central region for closed-eyes trials, an increase in theta and beta
band ASP in the parietal region for open-eyes trials. In habituation, no
significant variations in ASP were observed during closed-eyes trials, whereas
an increase in theta, alpha, and beta band ASP was observed with open eyes.
Furthermore, open-eyed trials generally yielded a greater number of significant
ASP differences across all bands during both adaptation and habituation,
suggesting that following cortical activity during postural perturbation may be
up-regulated with the availability of visual feedback. Results provide deeper
insight into pathological postural control failure by exploring the dynamic
changes in both cortical activity and postural kinematics during adaptation and
habituation to proprioceptive postural perturbation.

node in the network represents a voter and can be in one of two states that
correspond to different opinions shared by the voters. A voter disagreeing with
its neighbor's opinion may either adopt it or rewire its link to another
randomly chosen voter with any opinion. The system is studied by means of the
pair approximation in which the distinction between the average degrees of
nodes in different states is made. This approach allows us to identify two
dynamically active phases, a symmetric and an asymmetric one. The asymmetric
active phase, in contrast to the symmetric, is characterized by different
numbers of nodes in the opposite states that coexist in the network. The pair
approximation predicts the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which
leads to a continuous phase transition between the symmetric and the asymmetric
active phases. Interestingly, the asymmetric active phase is not displayed by
the model where the rewriting occurs only to voters sharing the same opinion.
Our results are backed up by Monte Carlo simulations.

can lead to axion clump formation. On the other hand, when the symmetry is
already broken during inflation, it has been believed that the axion clump
formation does not occur due to the small amplitude of the initial axion
fluctuation. We revisit this prevailing understanding, considering both the QCD
axion and an ALP. We find that for the QCD axion, the clump formation does not
occur even if we consider an extremely fine-tuned initial condition. Meanwhile,
it turns out that for an ALP which allows a more general potential form, the
clump formation can take place through the tachyonic instability or/and the

duality (several results are new even for smooth Lorentzian manifolds). The
second one is to give a synthetic notion of ""timelike Ricci curvature bounded

phonon-mediated superconductors, that exhibit high values of the critical
temperature. In the present study, the superconducting properties of the
compressed selenium hydride in its simplest form (HSe) are analyzed, toward
quantitative characterization of this phase. By using the state-of-art
Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, it is shown that the critical temperature in this
material is relatively high ($T_{c}$=42.65 K) and surpass the level of
magnesium diboride superconductor, assuming that the Coulomb pseudopotential
takes value of $0.1$. Moreover, the employed theoretical model allows us to
characterize other pivotal thermodynamic properties such as the superconducting
band gap, the free energy, the specific heat and the critical magnetic field.
In what follows, it is shown that the characteristic thermodynamic ratios for
the aforementioned parameters differ from the predictions of the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. As a result, we argue that strong-coupling
and retardation effects play important role in the discussed superconducting

The improvement may be in terms of preservation, revitalization, livability,
and sustainability of a community. The resources of the nodes and devices in
the SCC have certain constraints that may not allow the devices and nodes to
cooperate to save their resources such as memory, energy, and buffer, or simply
maximize their performance. Thus, to stimulate the nodes to avoid selfish
behavior, SSC needs a novel and well-organized solution to motivate nodes for
cooperation. This article aims to resolve the issue of selfish behaviors in SCC
and to encourage the nodes for cooperation. A novel mechanism Socially Omitting
Selfishness (SOS) has been proposed to manage/eradicate selfishness using a
socially-oriented election process. The election process elects different heads
based on weight and cooperation (using VCG model). The election of heads and
incentive mechanism encourages the nodes to show participation and behave as
highly cooperative members of the community. Furthermore, an extended version
of the Dempster-Shafer model has been used to discourage the selfish behavior
of the participating nodes in the SOS scheme. It uses different monitoring and
gateway nodes to efficiently employ the proposed scheme. A mathematical model
has been developed for the aforementioned aspects and simulated through the NS2
simulation environment to analyze the performance of SOS. The results of the
proposed scheme outperform the contemporary schemes in terms of average
delivery delay, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and average energy.

of particle filtering methods under certain assumptions. However, some
applications of particle filtering methods, such as radiation source
localization problems, can be shown to have an extended convergence in the
following sense. Using the assumptions of statistically independent
measurements and a measurement process that does not depend on the state space,
we prove the convergence of the posterior and its approximation by the particle
filtering algorithm to the true Dirac distribution characterizing the source
location. We design a Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR) filter to detect and
locate a radiation source using a network of sensors. To numerically assess the
effectiveness of this particle filter we employ it to solve a source
localization problem using both experimental open field data sets from
Intelligent Radiation Sensor Systems (IRSS) tests and numerically simulated
urban domain data using a ray-tracing model. We then prove the theoretical
convergence of the estimate to the state posterior probability density
function.

  conjectures","  Recently, Li obtained an asymptotic formula for a certain partial sum
involving coefficients for the polynomial in the First Borwein conjecture. As a
consequence, he showed the positivity of this sum. His result was based on a
sieving principle discovered by himself and Wan. In fact, Li points out in his
paper that his method can be generalized to prove an asymptotic formula for a
general partial sum involving coefficients for any prime $p>3$. In this work,
we extend Li's method to obtain asymptotic formula for several partial sums of
coefficients of a very general polynomial. We find that in the special cases
$p=3, 5$, the signs of these sums are consistent with the three famous Borwein
conjectures. Similar sums have been studied earlier by Zaharescu using a
completely different method. We also improve on the error terms in the
asymptotic formula for Li and Zaharescu. Using a recent result of Borwein, we
also obtain an asymptotic estimate for the maximum of the absolute value of
these coefficients for primes $p=2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13$ and for $p>15$, we obtain
a lower bound on the maximum absolute value of these coefficients for
sufficiently large $n$.

saddle points sourced by axion fields in quantum gravity (AdS/CFT), such as
wormholes, their extremal ""D-instanton"" limits and their under-extremal
singular counterparts. Concerning wormholes we argue they cannot contribute to
the path integral because a stability analysis suggests they fragment like
other super-extremal objects. For concrete AdS/CFT embeddings the Euclidean
saddle point solutions are neatly described by geodesic curves living inside
moduli spaces and can typically be solved for using group theory. Our working
example is $AdS_5\times S^5/\mathbb{Z}_k$ and allows for smooth Euclidean
wormholes. For the supersymmetric D-instanton-like solutions we seem to find a
match with the instantons in the dual $\mathcal{N}=2$ quivers. This match even
extends a bit further to self-dual instantons without supersymmetry.

calibrationless magnetic resonance image (Cl-MRI) reconstruction that is fast,
memory efficient, and scales to high-dimensional imaging.
  Theory and Methods: Cl-MRI methods can afford higher acceleration rates, but
their clinical application is limited by computational complexity and large
memory footprint. A proposed computational procedure, HIgh-dimensional fast
ConvolUtional framework (HICU), not only addresses these issues but also scales
to jointly process undersampled k-space data across space, time, and coils.
  Results: For validation, HICU is applied to ten T2-weighted brain and six
cardiac cine datasets. The static imaging results show that HICU offers 16 to
153-fold computation speedup compared to other Cl-MRI methods, without
sacrificing imaging quality. The dynamic imaging results show that the
computational acceleration techniques included in HICU yield more than 10-fold
reduction in computation time and that HICU recovery outperforms traditional
SENSE-based compressed sensing methods by one to three dB in k-space
reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio.
  Conclusions: Compared to existing Cl-MRI algorithms, HICU offers a smaller
memory footprint, higher computational speed, and a unifying framework. Our
preliminary results show the promise of HICU in 2D static and 2D dynamic
applications; moreover, the proposed framework can be readily extended to other
multi-coil MRI applications.

sophistication and difficulty to detect. Attacks have become a national/global
threat as they have targeted private and public, as well as government sectors
over the years. This is a growing issue and organisations are taking steps to
reduce, detect and prevent threats. To do this they need to use systems that
are equipped with the capabilities to do either of those steps and develop them
for the type of networks they use, for instance wired or wireless. One of these
systems are Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which can be used as the first
defence mechanism or a secondary defence mechanism of a threat or an attack.
There are different types of attacks that can occur in a network, such as
Denial of service (DoS)/Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), port scanning,
malware or ransomware and so forth that IDSs have a capability of detecting.
Assisting in the mitigation of such attacks, there are also Intrusion
Prevention Systems (IPS) whose role has a different purpose than that of IDSs.
Unlike IDSs they not only detect threats but prevent them from disrupting the
network, IPSs can be used in conjunction with IDSs to double the defences. This
paper provides an overview of IDS and their classifications and IPS. It will
detail typical benefits and limitations to using IDSs, IPSs and the hybrids
(such as Intrusions Detection Prevention Systems (IDPSs and more)) which will
be discussed further. It will also outline developments in the making using ML
and how it is used to improve these systems and the dilemmas they produce and
possible ways to counter act them.

a multifunctional platform material due to its desirable properties, including
its lightweight nature, high mechanical properties, and good conductivity.
However, their mass adoption and applications by industry have run into
significant bottlenecks because of large variability and uncertainty in quality
during fabrication. There is an urgent demand to produce high-quality,
high-performance buckypaper at an industrial scale. Raman spectroscopy provides
detailed nanostructure information within seconds, and the obtained spectra can
be decomposed into multiple effects associated with diverse quality
characteristics of buckypaper. However, the decomposed effects are
high-dimensional, and a systematic quantification method for buckypaper quality
assessment has been lacking. In this paper, we propose a real-time data-driven
quality assessment method, which fills in the blank of quantifying the quality
for continuous manufacturing processes of CNT buckypaper. The composite indices
derived from the proposed method are developed by analyzing in-line Raman
spectroscopy sensing data. Weighted cross-correlation and maximum margin
clustering are used to fuse the fixed effects into an inconsistency index to
monitor the long-term mean shift of the process and to fuse the normal effects
into a uniformity index to monitor the within-sample normality. Those
individual quality indices are then combined into a composite index to reflect
the overall quality of buckypaper. A case study indicates that our proposed
approach can determine the quality rank for ten samples, and can provide
quantitative quality indices for single-walled carbon nanotube buckypaper after
acid processing or functionalization. The quality assessment results are
consistent with evaluations from the experienced engineers.

challenging. The fine-scale density structures observed in white light images
taken during Total Solar Eclipses (TSEs) are currently the best proxy for
inferring the magnetic field direction in the corona from the solar limb out to
several solar radii (Rs). We present, for the first time, the topology of the
coronal magnetic field continuously between 1 and 6 Rs, as quantitatively
inferred with the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) for 14 unique eclipse coronae
that span almost two complete solar cycles. We find that the direction of the
coronal magnetic field does not become radial until at least 3 Rs, with a high
variance between 1.5 and 3 Rs at different latitudes and phases of the solar
cycle. We find that the most non-radial coronal field topologies occur above
regions with weaker magnetic field strengths in the photosphere, while stronger
photospheric fields are associated with highly radial field lines in the
corona. In addition, we find an abundance of field lines which extend
continuously from the solar surface out to several solar radii at all
latitudes, regardless of the presence of coronal holes. These results have
implications for testing and constraining coronal magnetic field models, and
for linking in situ solar wind measurements to their sources at the Sun.

are adopting sustainable transportation solutions for their everyday commutes.
However, as more people use the system, riders often encounter that bikes or
docks might not be available when they arrive to a station. As a result, many
systems like CitiBike and Divvy provide riders with information about the
network via smartphone apps so that riders can find stations with available
bikes. However, not all customers have adopted the use of these smartphone apps
for their station selection. By combining customer choice modeling and finite
capacity queueing models, we explore the impact of the smartphone app
technology to increase throughput and reduce blocking in bike sharing systems.
To this end, we prove a mean-field limit and a central limit theorem for an
empirical process of the number of stations with $k$ bikes. We also prove limit
theorems for a new process called the ratio process, which characterizes the
proportion of stations whose bike availability ratio lies within a particular
partition of the interval [0,1]. For the mean field limit, we prove that the
equilibrium exists, is unique, and that the stationary distribution of the
empirical measure converges to a Dirac mass at the same equilibrium, thus
showing an interchange of limits result ($\lim_{t\rightarrow
\infty}\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}=\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\lim_{t\rightarrow
\infty}$). Our limit theorems provide insight on the mean, variance, and sample
path dynamics of large scale bike-sharing systems. Our results illustrate that
if we increase the proportion of customers that use smartphone app information,
the entropy of the bike sharing network is reduced, and riders experience less
blocking in the network.

  from the fatality time series in COVID-19 outbreaks","  In the absence of other tools, monitoring the effects of protective measures,
including social distancing and forecasting the outcome of outbreaks is of
immense interest. Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic
errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of
empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In
this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a
master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic
reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection
rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable
differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities.
We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows
this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic
growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic
reproduction number is less than $2.3$. This condition is valid for the
outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The
difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the
separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal
variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model
remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.

in particle physics. For track fitting, its standard use is always accompanied
by an easy guess for the probability distribution of the positioning errors.
This is an incorrect assumption that degrades the results of the fit. The
explicit error forms show evident Cauchy-(Agnesi) tails that render problematic
the use of variance minimizations. Here, we report the probability
distributions for some combinations of random variables, impossible to find in
literature, but essential for track fitting: $x={\xi}/{(\xi+\eta)}$,
$y={(\xi-\eta)}/[2{(\xi+\eta)}]$, $w=\xi/\eta$, $x=\theta(x_3-x_1)
(-x_3)/(x_3+x_2) +\theta(x_1-x_3)x_1/(x_1+x_2)$ and
$x=(x_1-x_3)/(x_1+x_2+x_3)$. The first three are directly connected to each
other and are partial forms of the two-strip center of gravity. The fourth is
the complete two-strip center of gravity. For its very complex form, it allows
only approximate expressions of the probability. The last expression is a
simplified form of the three-strip center of gravity. General integral forms
are obtained for all of them. Detailed analytical expressions are calculated
assuming $\xi$, $\eta$, $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ independent random variables

five-minute scan.
  Theory and Methods: The data are acquired continuously using Cartesian
sampling and sorted into respiratory and cardiac bins using the self-gating
signal. The reconstruction is performed using a recently proposed Bayesian
method called ReVEAL4D. For validation, three acquisitions were performed from
eight healthy volunteers: five-minute self-gated 4D flow with whole-heart
coverage, conventional respiratory-navigated 4D flow imaging of the aortic arch
(4D-GRAPPA), and breath-held 2D phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) in multiple views.
The five-minute accelerated datasets were reconstructed using ReVEAL4D and a
compressed sensing (CS) technique, L1-SENSE.
  Results: Compared to 2D PC-MRI, flow quantification from ReVEAL4D showed no
significant bias. In contrast, the peak velocity and peak flow rate for
L1-SENSE were significantly underestimated. Compared to 4D-GRAPPA, ReVEAL4D
demonstrated small but significant biases in net flow and peak flow rate, with
no significant bias in peak velocity. All three indices were significantly and
more markedly underestimated by L1-SENSE.
  Conclusions: The combination of highly accelerated five-minute Cartesian
acquisition, self-gating, and ReVEAL4D enables whole-heart 4D flow imaging with
accurate flow quantification.

of area $A$ such that the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the operator
$(-\Delta)^s+\alpha \chi_D$ is as small as possible. The solution $D$ is called
as an optimal configuration for the data $(\Omega,\alpha,A)$. Looking at the

  We prove existence of solutions and study properties of optimal configuration
$D$. This is a free boundary problem which could be formulated as a two-sided
unstable obstacle problem.
  Moreover, we show that for some rotationally symmetric domains (thin annuli),
the optimal configuration is not rotational symmetric, which implies the
non-uniqueness of the optimal configuration $D$. On the other hand, we prove
that for a convex domain $\Omega$ having reflection symmetries, the optimal
configuration possesses the same symmetries, which implies uniqueness of the
optimal configuration $D$ in the ball case.

dynamics of the Hamiltonian and the energy of the system. Focusing on the
dynamical evolution of the quantum state under the action of PT symmetric
Hamiltonian, here we experimentally demonstrated the general dynamical
evolution of a two-level system under the PT symmetric Hamiltonian using
single-photon system. By enlarging the system using ancillary qubits and
encoding the subsystem under the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with post-selection,
the evolution of the state can be observed with a high fidelity when the
successfully parity-time symmetrically evolved subspace is solely considered.
Owing to the effectively operation of the dilation method, our work provides a
route for further exploiting the exotic properties of PT symmetric Hamiltonian
for quantum simulation and quantum information processing.

  Chain-Letter Petitions","  Algorithms to find optimal alignments among strings, or to find a
parsimonious summary of a collection of strings, are well studied in a variety
of contexts, addressing a wide range of interesting applications. In this
paper, we consider chain letters, which contain a growing sequence of
signatories added as the letter propagates. The unusual constellation of
features exhibited by chain letters (one-ended growth, divergence, and
mutation) make their propagation, and thus the corresponding reconstruction
problem, both distinctive and rich. Here, inspired by these chain letters, we
formally define the problem of computing an optimal summary of a set of
diverging string sequences. From a collection of these sequences of names, with
each sequence noisily corresponding to a branch of the unknown tree $T$
representing the letter's true dissemination, can we efficiently and accurately
reconstruct a tree $T' \approx T$? In this paper, we give efficient exact
algorithms for this summarization problem when the number of sequences is
small; for larger sets of sequences, we prove hardness and provide an efficient
heuristic algorithm. We evaluate this heuristic on synthetic data sets chosen
to emulate real chain letters, showing that our algorithm is competitive with
or better than previous approaches, and that it also comes close to finding the
true trees in these synthetic datasets.

learning methods. Adversarial training can enhance robustness, but past work
often finds it hurts generalization. In natural language processing (NLP),
pre-training large neural language models such as BERT have demonstrated
impressive gain in generalization for a variety of tasks, with further
improvement from adversarial fine-tuning. However, these models are still
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that adversarial
pre-training can improve both generalization and robustness. We propose a
general algorithm ALUM (Adversarial training for large neural LangUage Models),
which regularizes the training objective by applying perturbations in the
embedding space that maximizes the adversarial loss. We present the first
comprehensive study of adversarial training in all stages, including
pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training on a well-trained model, and
task-specific fine-tuning. ALUM obtains substantial gains over BERT on a wide
range of NLP tasks, in both regular and adversarial scenarios. Even for models
that have been well trained on extremely large text corpora, such as RoBERTa,
ALUM can still produce significant gains from continual pre-training, whereas
conventional non-adversarial methods can not. ALUM can be further combined with
task-specific fine-tuning to attain additional gains. The ALUM code and
pre-trained models will be made publicly available at

turbulent fluxes. These have profound implications for virtually all aspects of
the turbulence dynamics. In magnetic confinement devices, drift-wave turbulence
produces anomalous fluxes via cross-correlations between fluctuations. In this
work, we introduce a new, data-driven method for parameterizing these fluxes.
The method uses deep supervised learning to infer a reduced mean-field model
from a set of numerical simulations. We apply the method to a simple drift-wave
turbulence system and find a significant new effect which couples the particle
flux to the local \emph{gradient} of vorticity. Notably, here, this effect is
much stronger than the oft-invoked shear suppression effect. We also recover
the result via a simple calculation. The vorticity gradient effect tends to
modulate the density profile. In addition, our method recovers a model for
spontaneous zonal flow generation by negative viscosity, stabilized by
nonlinear and hyperviscous terms. We highlight the important role of symmetry
to implementation of the new method.

  Search","  Neural Architecture Search (NAS), i.e., the automation of neural network
design, has gained much popularity in recent years with increasingly complex
search algorithms being proposed. Yet, solid comparisons with simple baselines
are often missing. At the same time, recent retrospective studies have found
many new algorithms to be no better than random search (RS). In this work we
consider, for the first time, a simple Local Search (LS) algorithm for NAS. We
particularly consider a multi-objective NAS formulation, with network accuracy
and network complexity as two objectives, as understanding the trade-off
between these two objectives is arguably the most interesting aspect of NAS.
The proposed LS algorithm is compared with RS and two evolutionary algorithms
(EAs), as these are often heralded as being ideal for multi-objective
optimization. To promote reproducibility, we create and release two benchmark
datasets containing 200K saved network evaluations for two established image
classification tasks, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our benchmarks are designed to be
complementary to existing benchmarks, especially in that they are better suited
for multi-objective search. We additionally consider a version of the problem
with a much larger architecture space. While we find and show that the
considered algorithms explore the search space in fundamentally different ways,
we also find that LS substantially outperforms RS and even performs nearly as
good as state-of-the-art EAs. We believe that this provides strong evidence
that LS is truly a competitive baseline for NAS against which new NAS
algorithms should be benchmarked.

flows. To date, the majority of RANS closures are based on extensions of
single-phase turbulence models, which fail to capture complex two-phase flow
dynamics across dilute and dense regimes, especially when two-way coupling
between the phases is important. In the present study, particles settle under
gravity in an unbounded viscous fluid. At sufficient mass loadings, interphase
momentum exchange between the phases results in the spontaneous generation of
particle clusters that sustain velocity fluctuations in the fluid. Data
generated from Eulerian--Lagrangian simulations are used in a sparse regression
method for model closure that ensures form invariance. Particular attention is
paid to modelling the unclosed terms unique to the multiphase RANS equations
(drag production, drag exchange, pressure strain and viscous dissipation). A
minimal set of tensors is presented that serve as the basis for modelling. It
is found that sparse regression identifies compact, algebraic models that are
accurate across flow conditions and robust to sparse training data.

  Trade-off","  Monitoring location updates from mobile users has important applications in
many areas, ranging from public safety and national security to social networks

patterns, thus protecting the privacy of mobile users is a major concern. Users
may only be willing to disclose their locations when some condition is met, for
instance in proximity of a disaster area or an event of interest. Currently,
such functionality can be achieved using searchable encryption. Such
cryptographic primitives provide provable guarantees for privacy, and allow
decryption only when the location satisfies some predicate. Nevertheless, they
rely on expensive pairing-based cryptography (PBC), of which direct application
to the domain of location updates leads to impractical solutions. We propose
secure and efficient techniques for private processing of location updates that
complement the use of PBC and lead to significant gains in performance by
reducing the amount of required pairing operations. We implement two
optimizations that further improve performance: materialization of results to
expensive mathematical operations, and parallelization. We also propose an
heuristic that brings down the computational overhead through enlarging an
alert zone by a small factor (given as system parameter), therefore trading off
a small and controlled amount of privacy for significant performance gains.
Extensive experimental results show that the proposed techniques significantly
improve performance compared to the baseline, and reduce the searchable

with reasonable resources, such as the cloud.

we show that by integrating well-known signal processing (SP) techniques (i.e.
short time Fourier transform, continuous wavelet analysis and Wigner-Ville

neural networks trained on first principles computational QM calculations such
as density functional theory, which outputs the properties of the molecules.
Tested on the QM9 dataset (composed of 133,855 molecules and 19 properties),
the new QM-SP-ML model is able to predict the properties of molecules with a
mean absolute error (MAE) below acceptable chemical accuracy (i.e. MAE < 1

Furthermore, the new approach performs similarly or better compared to other ML

  Synthesis","  Thermal-to-visible face verification is a challenging problem due to the
large domain discrepancy between the modalities. Existing approaches either
attempt to synthesize visible faces from thermal faces or extract robust
features from these modalities for cross-modal matching. In this paper, we use
attributes extracted from visible images to synthesize the attributepreserved
visible images from thermal imagery for cross-modal matching. A pre-trained
VGG-Face network is used to extract the attributes from the visible image.
Then, a novel multi-scale generator is proposed to synthesize the visible image
from the thermal image guided by the extracted attributes. Finally, a
pretrained VGG-Face network is leveraged to extract features from the
synthesized image and the input visible image for verification. An extended
dataset consisting of polarimetric thermal faces of 121 subjects is also
introduced. Extensive experiments evaluated on various datasets and protocols
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art per-formance.

the linear part of the holomorphic germ $f$ determines some natural

development of high-throughput sequencing techniques nowadays. The observed
data has the following typical characteristics: it is high-dimensional,
compositional (lying in a simplex) and even may be leptokurtic, which makes the
conventional correlation analysis infeasible to study the co-occurrence and
co-exclusion relationship between microbial taxa. In this article, we address
the challenges of covariance estimation for this kind of data. Assuming the
basis covariance matrix lying in a well-recognized class of sparse covariance
matrices, we adopt a proxy matrix known as centered log-ratio covariance
matrix, which is approximately indistinguishable from the real basis covariance
matrix as the dimensionality tends to infinity. The procedure can be viewed as
adaptively thresholding the Median-of-Means estimator for the centered
log-ratio covariance matrix. We derive the rates of convergence under the
spectral norm and element-wise $\ell_\infty$ norm. In addition, we also provide
theoretical guarantees on support recovery. Thorough simulation studies are
conducted to show the advantages of the proposed procedure over some
state-of-the-arts methods. At last, we apply the proposed method to analyze a

For this purpose, the real-space renormalization method is employed to build
effective Hamiltonian that captures the low-energy physics of a given system.
We show that the ground and first-excited eigenstates of an $

adding a spin adiabatically and vice versa. Numerical simulation shows that the

if and only if $xx'\in E(G)$ and $yy'\in E(H)$. This conjecture received a lot
of attention in the past half century. Recently, Shitov refuted this
conjecture. Let $p$ be the minimum number of vertices in a graph of odd girth
$7$ and fractional chromatic number greater than $(3+4/(p-1))$. Shitov's proof
shows that Hedetniemi's conjecture fails for some graphs with chromatic number
about $p^22^{p+1} $ and with more than $(p^22^{p+1})^{p^32^{p-1}}$ vertices. In
this paper, we show that the conjecture fails already for some graphs $G$ and

currently known upper bound for $p$ is $607$ (and we expect the exact value of

conducting a large campaign to spectroscopically classify all transients
occurring in galaxies in the Census of the Local Universe (CLU) catalog. The
aim of the experiment is to construct a spectroscopically complete,
volume-limited sample of transients coincident within 100"" of CLU galaxies out
to 200 Mpc, and to a depth of 20 mag. We describe the survey design and
spectroscopic completeness from the first 16 months of operations. We present
results from a systematic search for Calcium rich gap transients in the sample
of 22 low luminosity (peak absolute magnitude $M > -17$), hydrogen poor events
found in the experiment (out of 754 spectroscopically classified SNe). We
report the detection of eight Calcium rich gap transients, and constrain their
volumetric rate to be at least $\approx 15\pm5$% of the SN Ia rate. Combining
this sample with ten events from the literature, we find a likely continuum of
spectroscopic properties ranging from events with SN Ia-like features (Ca-Ia
objects) to SN Ib/c-like features (Ca-Ib/c objects) at peak light. Within the
Ca-Ib/c events, we find two populations of events distinguished by their red
($g - r \approx 1.5$ mag) or green ($g - r \approx 0.5$ mag) spectral colors at
$r$-band peak, wherein redder events show strong line blanketing signatures,
slower light curves, weaker He lines and lower [Ca II]/[O I] in the nebular
phase. Together, we find that the spectroscopic continuum, volumetric rates and
striking old environments are consistent with the explosive burning of He
shells on low mass white dwarfs. We posit that Ca-Ia and red Ca-Ib/c objects
are consistent with the double detonation of He shells with high He burning
efficiency, while green Ca-Ib/c objects could arise from less efficient He
burning scenarios such as detonations in low density He shells or He shell
deflagrations.

$\sim$3700-9000 \AA with R$\approx$1800. The Cygnus Loop is a prototype of
middle-aged SNRs, which has the advantages of being bright, large in angular
size, and relatively unobscured by dust. Along the line of sight to the Cygnus
Loop, 2747 LAMOST DR5 spectra are found in total, which are spatially
distributed over the entire remnant. This spectral sample is free of the
selection bias of most previous studies, which often focus on bright filaments
or regions bright in [O III]. Visual inspection verifies that 368 spectra
(13$\%$ of the total) show clear spectral features to confirm their association
with the remnant. In addition, 176 spectra with line emission show ambiguity of
their origin but have a possible association to the SNR. In particular, the 154
spectra dominated by the SNR emission are further analyzed by identifying
emission lines and measuring their intensities. We examine distributions of
physical properties such as electron density and temperature, which vary
significantly inside the remnant, using theoretical models. By combining a
large number of the LAMOST spectra, a global spectrum representing the Cygnus
Loop is constructed, which presents characteristics of radiative shocks.
Finally, we discuss the effect of the unbiased spectral sample on the global
spectrum and its implication to understand a spatially unresolved SNR in a
distant galaxy.

  Regularization and Singular Value Sparsification","  Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) often require high memory consumption and
large computational loads. In order to deploy DNN algorithms efficiently on
edge or mobile devices, a series of DNN compression algorithms have been
explored, including factorization methods. Factorization methods approximate
the weight matrix of a DNN layer with the multiplication of two or multiple
low-rank matrices. However, it is hard to measure the ranks of DNN layers
during the training process. Previous works mainly induce low-rank through
implicit approximations or via costly singular value decomposition (SVD)
process on every training step. The former approach usually induces a high
accuracy loss while the latter has a low efficiency. In this work, we propose
SVD training, the first method to explicitly achieve low-rank DNNs during
training without applying SVD on every step. SVD training first decomposes each
layer into the form of its full-rank SVD, then performs training directly on
the decomposed weights. We add orthogonality regularization to the singular
vectors, which ensure the valid form of SVD and avoid gradient
vanishing/exploding. Low-rank is encouraged by applying sparsity-inducing
regularizers on the singular values of each layer. Singular value pruning is
applied at the end to explicitly reach a low-rank model. We empirically show
that SVD training can significantly reduce the rank of DNN layers and achieve
higher reduction on computation load under the same accuracy, comparing to not
only previous factorization methods but also state-of-the-art filter pruning
methods.

  images","  Satellite-based solar irradiation forecasting is useful for short-term
intra-day time horizons, outperforming numerical weather predictions up to 3-4
hours ahead. The main techniques for solar satellite forecast are based on
sophisticated cloud motion estimates from geostationary satellite images. This
work explores the use of satellite information in a simpler way, namely spatial
averages that require almost no preprocessing. Adaptive auto-regressive models
are used to assess the impact of this information on the forecasting
performance. A complete analysis regarding model selection, the satellite
averaging window size and the inclusion of satellite past measurements is
provided. It is shown that: (i) satellite spatial averages are useful inputs
and the averaging window size is an important parameter, (ii) satellite lags
are of limited utility and spatial averages are more useful than weighted time
averages, and (iii) there is no value in fine-tuning the orders of
auto-regressive models for each time horizon, as the same performance can be
obtained by using a fixed well-selected order. These ideas are tested for a
region with intermediate solar variability, and the models succeed to
outperform a proposed optimal smart persistence, used here as an exigent
performance benchmark.

space, which can easily lead to overfitting when it encounters small-sample
data. To mitigate overfitting in small-sample classification, learning more
discriminative features from small-sample data is becoming a new trend. To this
end, this paper aims to find a subspace of neural networks that can facilitate
a large decision margin. Specifically, we propose the Orthogonal Softmax Layer
(OSL), which makes the weight vectors in the classification layer remain
orthogonal during both the training and test processes. The Rademacher
complexity of a network using the OSL is only $\frac{1}{K}$, where $K$ is the
number of classes, of that of a network using the fully connected
classification layer, leading to a tighter generalization error bound.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed OSL has better performance
than the methods used for comparison on four small-sample benchmark datasets,

its susceptibility to learning spurious correlations rather than the underlying

be addressed by simply using more data from the same distribution. We propose
an auxiliary training objective that improves the generalization capabilities
of neural networks by leveraging an overlooked supervisory signal found in
existing datasets. We use pairs of minimally-different examples with different
labels, a.k.a counterfactual or contrasting examples, which provide a signal
indicative of the underlying causal structure of the task. We show that such
pairs can be identified in a number of existing datasets in computer vision
(visual question answering, multi-label image classification) and natural
language processing (sentiment analysis, natural language inference). The new
training objective orients the gradient of a model's decision function with
pairs of counterfactual examples. Models trained with this technique
demonstrate improved performance on out-of-distribution test sets.

B-spline surfaces from a sequence of straight line segments indicating the
surface shape. The first and last line segments are enforced to be the head and
tail ruling lines of the resulting surface while the interior lines are
required to approximate rulings on the resulting surface as much as possible.
This manner of developable surface design is conceptually similar to the
popular way of the freeform curve and surface design in the CAD community,
observing that a developable ruled surface is a single parameter family of
straight lines. This new design mode of the developable surface also provides
more flexibility than the widely employed way of developable surface design
from two boundary curves of the surface. The problem is treated by numerical
optimization methods with which a particular level of distance error is
allowed. We thus provide an effective tool for creating surfaces with a high
degree of developability when the input control rulings do not lie in exact
developable surfaces. We view this ability as a superiority over analytical
methods in that it can deal with arbitrary design inputs and find practically
useful results.

$\mathit{Impl}$ may break some $\mathit{desired}$ properties that are not in
$\mathit{Spec}$. In either case, $\mathit{Spec}$ fails to expose bugs of
$\mathit{Impl}$. In an earlier paper, we addressed the first problem above by a
technique called Partial Quantifier Elimination (PQE). In contrast to complete
QE, in PQE, one takes out of the scope of quantifiers only a small piece of the
formula. We used PQE to generate properties of $\mathit{Impl}$ i.e. those
$\mathit{consistent}$ with $\mathit{Impl}$. Generation of an unwanted property
means that $\mathit{Impl}$ is buggy. In this paper, we address the second
problem above by using PQE to generate false properties i.e those that are
$\mathit{inconsistent}$ with $\mathit{Impl}$. Such properties are meant to
imitate the missing properties of $\mathit{Spec}$ that are not satisfied by
$\mathit{Impl}$ (if any). A false property is generated by modifying a piece of
a quantified formula describing 'the truth table' of $\mathit{Impl}$ and taking
this piece out of the scope of quantifiers. By modifying different pieces of
this formula one can generate a ""structurally complete"" set of false
properties. By generating tests detecting false properties of $\mathit{Impl}$
one produces a high quality test set. We apply our approach to verification of

classifier for a single narrow task. In this paper, we call for a shift that
flips this paradigm upside down. Specifically, we propose a ""small data for big
tasks"" paradigm, wherein a single artificial intelligence (AI) system is
challenged to develop ""common sense"", enabling it to solve a wide range of
tasks with little training data. We illustrate the potential power of this new
paradigm by reviewing models of common sense that synthesize recent
breakthroughs in both machine and human vision. We identify functionality,
physics, intent, causality, and utility (FPICU) as the five core domains of
cognitive AI with humanlike common sense. When taken as a unified concept,
FPICU is concerned with the questions of ""why"" and ""how"", beyond the dominant
""what"" and ""where"" framework for understanding vision. They are invisible in
terms of pixels but nevertheless drive the creation, maintenance, and
development of visual scenes. We therefore coin them the ""dark matter"" of
vision. Just as our universe cannot be understood by merely studying observable
matter, we argue that vision cannot be understood without studying FPICU. We
demonstrate the power of this perspective to develop cognitive AI systems with
humanlike common sense by showing how to observe and apply FPICU with little
training data to solve a wide range of challenging tasks, including tool use,
planning, utility inference, and social learning. In summary, we argue that the
next generation of AI must embrace ""dark"" humanlike common sense for solving
novel tasks.

  High Dimensions","  Many real-world problems can be formulated as geometric optimization problems
in high dimensions, especially in the fields of machine learning and data
mining. Moreover, we often need to take into account of outliers when
optimizing the objective functions. However, the existence of outliers could
make the problems to be much more challenging than their vanilla versions. In
this paper, we study the fundamental minimum enclosing ball (MEB) with outliers
problem first; partly inspired by the core-set method from B\u{a}doiu and
Clarkson, we propose a sub-linear time bi-criteria approximation algorithm
based on two novel techniques, the Uniform-Adaptive Sampling method and
Sandwich Lemma. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first
sub-linear time algorithm having the sample size independent of both the input
number of points $n$ and dimensionality $d$. Furthermore, we observe that these
two techniques can be generalized to deal with a broader range of geometric
optimization problems with outliers in high dimensions, including flat fitting,
$k$-center clustering, and SVM with outliers, and therefore achieve sub-linear
time bi-criteria approximation algorithms for these problems respectively.

the electron-hole acceleration dynamics by laser fields. Furthermore, by
tracing the scattered trajectories in real-space, the model fairly describes
the emitted photon energy and the emission timing of the HHG even in the higher

as an effective and efficient alternative to the list or tree based data
structures for dynamic data set. It consists of two sub-arrays, one white and
one black of half of the size of the white. Both of them are conceptually
partitioned into segments of different ranks with the sizes grow in geometric
sequence. The layout of BWA allows easy calculation of the meta-data about the
segments, which are used extensively in the algorithms for the basic operations
of the dynamic sets. The insertion of a sequence of unordered numbers into BWA
takes amortized time logarithmic to the length of the sequence. It is also
proven that when the searched or deleted value is present in the BWA, the
asymptotic amortized cost for the operations is O(log(n)); otherwise, the time
will fall somewhere between O(log(n)) and O(log^2(n)). It is shown that the
state variable total, which records the number of values in the BWA captures
the dynamics of state transition of BWA. This fact is exploited to produce
concise, easy- to-understand, and efficient coding for the operations. As it
uses arrays as the underlying structure for dynamic set, a BWA need neither the
space to store the pointers referencing other data nodes nor the time to chase
the pointers as with any linked data structures. A C++ implementation of the
BWA is completed. The performance data were gathered and plotted, which
confirmed the theoretic analysis. The testing results showed that the amortized
time for the insert, search, and delete operations is all just between 105.949

understand the global behaviour of the flow: for the cocompact case, the
condition is straightforward and the argument is largely standard. For the
closed case however, the argument is quite complex. The flow shrinks every
initial curve to a point if it does not become singular beforehand, and we must
identify a condition to ensure this behaviour as well as identify the point in
order to perform the requisite rescaling. We are able to successfully conduct a
full analysis of the rescaling under a curvature condition. The analysis
resembles the case of the mean curvature flow more than other fourth-order

  Convolution Neural Network","  Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) plays an increasingly
significant role in urban planning, topographic mapping, environmental
monitoring, power line detection and other fields thanks to its capability to
quickly acquire large-scale and high-precision ground information. To achieve
point cloud classification, previous studies proposed point cloud deep learning
models that can directly process raw point clouds based on PointNet-like
architectures. And some recent works proposed graph convolution neural network
based on the inherent topology of point clouds. However, the above point cloud
deep learning models only pay attention to exploring local geometric
structures, yet ignore global contextual relationships among all points. In
this paper, we present a graph attention convolution neural network (GACNN)
that can be directly applied to the classification of unstructured 3D point
clouds obtained by airborne LiDAR. Specifically, we first introduce a graph
attention convolution module that incorporates global contextual information
and local structural features. Based on the proposed graph attention
convolution module, we further design an end-to-end encoder-decoder network,
named GACNN, to capture multiscale features of the point clouds and therefore
enable more accurate airborne point cloud classification. Experiments on the
ISPRS 3D labeling dataset show that the proposed model achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance in terms of average F1 score (71.5\%) and a
satisfying overall accuracy (83.2\%). Additionally, experiments further
conducted on the 2019 Data Fusion Contest Dataset by comparing with other
prevalent point cloud deep learning models demonstrate the favorable
generalization capability of the proposed model.

render the optimization problem highly non-convex. Therefore, we utilize the

Feedback regulation is crucial to tightly control this system, but the specific
mechanisms by which control is exerted are not completely understood. In this
work, we aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms in hematopoiesis by
conducting perturbation experiments, where animal subjects are exposed to an
external agent in order to observe the system response and evolution.
Developing a proper experimental design for these studies is an extremely
challenging task. To address this issue, we have developed a novel Bayesian
framework for optimal design of perturbation experiments. We model the numbers
of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in mice that are exposed to a low
dose of radiation. We use a differential equations model that accounts for
feedback and feedforward regulation. A significant obstacle is that the
experimental data are not longitudinal, rather each data point corresponds to a
different animal. This model is embedded in a hierarchical framework with
latent variables that capture unobserved cellular population levels. We select
the optimum design based on the amount of information gain, measured by the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the probability distributions before and
after observing the data. We evaluate our approach using synthetic and
experimental data. We show that a proper design can lead to better estimates of
model parameters even with relatively few subjects. Additionally, we
demonstrate that the model parameters show a wide range of sensitivities to
design options. Our method should allow scientists to find the optimal design

constraints on the 2-D microlens parallax vector $\bf{\pi_{\rm E}}$. When
combined, these yield a precise measurement of $\bf{\pi_{\rm E}}$, and so of
the masses of the host $M_{\rm host}=0.56\pm0.07\,M_\odot$ and planet $M_{\rm

L}=5.2 \pm 0.5 \ {\rm kpc}$ from the Sun toward the Galactic bulge, and the
host is more likely to be a dusk population star according to the kinematics of
the lens. The projected separation of the planet from the host is $a_{\perp} =
3.5 \pm 0.3 \ {\rm au}$, i.e., just over twice the snow line. The Galactic-disk
kinematics are established in part from a precise measurement of the source
proper motion based on OGLE-IV data. By contrast, the ${\it Gaia}$
proper-motion measurement of the source suffers from a catastrophic
$10\,\sigma$ error.

is proposed for visible light communication (VLC) systems. The proposed GDC
scheme achieves dimming control by simultaneously adjusting the intensity of
transmitted symbols and the number of active elements in a space-time matrix.
Both the indices of the active elements in each space-time matrix and the
modulated constellation symbols are used to carry information. Since
illumination is deemed as the prior task of VLC, an incremental algorithm for
index mapping is proposed for achieving target optical power and uniform
illumination. Next, GDC having the optimal activation pattern is investigated
to further improve the bit-error rate (BER) performance. In particular, the BER
performance of GDC is analyzed using the union bound technique. Based on the
analytical BER bound, the optimal activation pattern of GDC scheme with the
minimum BER criterion (GDC-MBER) is obtained by exhaustively searching all
conditional pairwise error probabilities. However, since GDC-MBER requires high
search complexity, two low-complexity GDC schemes having the maximum free
distance criterion (GDCMFD) are proposed. The first GDC-MFD scheme, coined as
GDC-MFD1, reduces the computational complexity by deriving a lower bound of the
free distance based on Rayleigh-Ritz theorem. Based on the time-invariance
characteristics of the VLC channel, GDC-MFD2 is proposed to further reduce the
required computation efforts. Simulation and numerical results show that
GDC-MBER, GDC-MFD1 and GDC-MFD2 have similar BER performance, and they can
achieve 2 dB performance gains over conventional hybrid dimming control scheme
and 7 dB performance gains over digital dimming control schemes.

Boundary and bulk effects are investigated systematically, putting emphasis on
the phase relation between the modulation and the atomic motion of the coherent
phonon. They are summarized as follows: Modulation by the boundary effect is in
phase with the coherent phonon amplitude, while that by the bulk effect shows
$\pi/2$ phase difference. Strong frequency dependence appears in the modulation
by the bulk effect, while no frequency dependence by the boundary effect.
First-principles calculations support the reliability of the analytical result.

elucidate the deterioration mechanism. Here, we present operando direct

spectroscopy in order to investigate the operation and deterioration mechanisms
from a microscopic viewpoint. By simultaneous measurements of solar-cell and
ESR characteristics of the same cell, the spin states in the hole-transport

level, which varies the device performance under device operation. These
variations are ascribed to the change of hole transport by charge-carrier
scatterings and filling of deep trapping levels in the HTM, and to interfacial
electric dipole layers formed at the HTM interfaces. In addition, reverse
electron transfer from TiO2 layer to the HTM layer is directly demonstrated at
the molecular level under ultraviolet light irradiation, which causes the

  We also obtain average-case results. We exactly compute the expected gains

conclude by providing a preference domain that ensures that those harmed by

  Collision-induced Absorption","  Explaining the evidence for surface liquid water on early Mars has been a
challenge for climate modelers, as the sun was ~30% less luminous during the
late-Noachian. We propose that the additional greenhouse forcing of CO2-H2
collision-induced absorption is capable of bringing the surface temperature
above freezing and can put early Mars into a limit-cycling regime. Limit cycles
occur when insolation is low and CO2 outgassing rates are unable to balance
with the rapid drawdown of CO2 during warm weathering periods. Planets in this
regime will alternate between global glaciation and transient warm climate
phases. This mechanism is capable of explaining the geomorphological evidence
for transient warm periods in the martian record. Previous work has shown that
collision-induced absorption of CO2-H2 was capable of deglaciating early Mars,
but only with high H2 outgassing rates (greater than ~600 Tmol/yr) and at high
surface pressures (between 3 to 4 bars). We used new theoretically derived
collision-induced absorption coefficients for CO2-H2 to reevaluate the climate
limit cycling hypothesis for early Mars. Using the new and stronger absorption
coefficients in our 1-dimensional radiative convective model as well as our
energy balance model, we find that limit cycling can occur with an H2
outgassing rate as low as ~300 Tmol/yr at surface pressures below 3 bars. Our

  shape planetary nebulae","  We use the stellar evolution code MESA-binary and follow the evolution of six
exoplanets to determine their potential role in the future evolution of their
parent star on the red giant branch (RGB) and on the asymptotic giant branch
(AGB). We limit this study to planets with orbits that have semi-major axis of
1AU<a<20AU, a high eccentricity, e>0.25, and having a parent star of mass
M>1Mo. We find that the star HIP 75458 will engulf its planet HIP75458 b during
its RGB phase. The planet will remove the envelope and terminate the RGB
evolution, leaving a bare helium core of mass 0.4Mo that will evolve to form a
helium white dwarf. Only in one system out of six, the planet beta Pic c will
enter the envelope of its parent star during the AGB phase. For that to occur,
we have to reduce the wind mass-loss rate by a factor of about four from its
commonly used value. This strengthens an early conclusion, which was based on
exoplanets with circular orbits, that states that to have a non-negligible
fraction of AGB stars that engulf planets we should consider lower wind
mass-loss rates of isolated AGB stars (before they are spun-up by a companion).
Such an engulfed planet might lead to the shaping of the AGB mass-loss geometry
to form an elliptical planetary nebula.

distribution over subsets $S$ of a ground set $[n]$, we say that $\mu$ is in
isotropic position if $P[e \in S]$ is the same for all $e\in [n]$. We design a
new approximate sampling algorithm that leverages isotropy for the class of
distributions $\mu$ that have a log-concave generating polynomial; this class
includes determinantal point processes, strongly Rayleigh distributions, and
uniform distributions over matroid bases. We show that when $\mu$ is in
approximately isotropic position, the running time of our algorithm depends
polynomially on the size of the set $S$, and only logarithmically on $n$. When
$n$ is much larger than the size of $S$, this is significantly faster than
prior algorithms, and can even be sublinear in $n$. We then show how to
transform a non-isotropic $\mu$ into an equivalent approximately isotropic form
with a polynomial-time preprocessing step, accelerating subsequent sampling
times. The main new ingredient enabling our algorithms is a class of negative
dependence inequalities that may be of independent interest.
  As an application of our results, we show how to approximately count bases of
a matroid of rank $k$ over a ground set of $n$ elements to within a factor of
$1+\epsilon$ in time $ O((n+1/\epsilon^2)\cdot poly(k, \log n))$. This is the
first algorithm that runs in nearly linear time for fixed rank $k$, and
achieves an inverse polynomially low approximation error.

and the method enables the simulation of ionic diffusion in $\mu$m-scale

the fragment kMC method was applied to predict the diffusion coefficients of

Finally, the fragment kMC method was customized for $\mu$-scale BaTiO$_3$

and the antiferromagnetic Ising model, there is an $\mathsf{FPTAS}$ for the
partition function on graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ when the infinite
regular tree lies in the uniqueness region by Li et al. (2013). Moreover, in
the tree non-uniqueness region, Sly (2010) showed that there is no
$\mathsf{FPRAS}$ to estimate the partition function unless
$\mathsf{NP}=\mathsf{RP}$. The algorithmic results follow from the correlation
decay approach due to Weitz (2006) or the polynomial interpolation approach
developed by Barvinok (2016). However the running time is only polynomial for
constant $\Delta$. For the hardcore model, recent work of Anari et al. (2020)
establishes rapid mixing of the simple single-site Markov chain known as the
Glauber dynamics in the tree uniqueness region. Our work simplifies their
analysis of the Glauber dynamics by considering the total pairwise influence of
a fixed vertex $v$ on other vertices, as opposed to the total influence on $v$,
thereby extending their work to all 2-spin models and improving the mixing
time.
  More importantly our proof ties together the three disparate algorithmic
approaches: we show that contraction of the tree recursions with a suitable
potential function, which is the primary technique for establishing efficiency
of Weitz's correlation decay approach and Barvinok's polynomial interpolation
approach, also establishes rapid mixing of the Glauber dynamics. We emphasize
that this connection holds for all 2-spin models (both antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic), and existing proofs for correlation decay or polynomial
interpolation immediately imply rapid mixing of Glauber dynamics. Our proof
utilizes that the graph partition function divides that of Weitz's
self-avoiding walk trees, leading to new tools for analyzing influence of
vertices.

The daytime presence in industrial and commercial areas decreased significantly
(33 percent average decrease); (iii) The distance individuals move from their
homes during a day was substantially reduced (38 percent decrease in the
maximum distance moved and 36 percent increase in share of individuals who move
less than one kilometer from home); (iv) Similar reductions in mobility were
found for residents in areas with different socioeconomic and demographic
characteristics. These results show that mild government policies can compel

the polarimetric properties, for some purposes in both Optics and SAR
Polarimetry, the concept of coherency vector associated with a nondepolarizing
medium has proven to be an useful mathematical structure that inherits certain
symmetries underlying the nature of linear polarimetric transformations of the
states of polarization of light caused by its interaction with material media.
While the Jones and Mueller matrices of a serial combination of devices are
given by the respective conventional matrix products, the composition of
coherency vectors of such serial combinations requires a specific and
unconventional mathematical rule. In this work, a vector product of coherency
vectors is presented that satisfies, in a meaningful and consistent manner, the
indicated requirements. As a result, a new algebraic formalism is built where
the representation of polarization states of electromagnetic waves through
Stokes vectors is preserved, while nondepolarizing media are represented by
coherency vectors and general media are represented by coherency matrices
generated by partially coherent compositions of the coherency vectors of the
components.

framework based on three layers (physical, data and decision) that defines the
possible designing options so that the rare events/anomalies can be detected
ultra-reliably. This general framework is then applied in a well-known
benchmark scenario, namely Tennessee Eastman Process. We then analyze this
benchmark under three threads related to data processes: acquisition, fusion
and analytics. Our numerical results indicate that: (i) event-driven data
acquisition can significantly decrease the number of samples while filtering
measurement noise, (ii) mutual information data fusion method can significantly
decrease the variable spaces and (iii) quantitative association rule mining
method for data analytics is effective for the rare event detection,
identification and diagnosis. These results indicates the benefits of an
integrated solution that jointly considers the different levels of data
processing following the proposed general three layer framework, including
details of the communication network and computing platform to be employed.

alternatives to conventional Li-ion batteries because of their high level of
safety and power density. The engineering of SSBs requires comprehensive
modeling of their physics and electrochemistry with an emphasis on the
interfacial processes, including electrochemical stability and mechanical
stresses. In this article, continuum-scale simulations are chosen as the
modeling framework to study such properties. A comprehensive continuum model is
constructed for the simulation of the electro-chemo-mechanical (ECM) response
of an SSB that resolves the bulk transportation of charged species and their
interfacial transfer kinetics. It also studies the formation of space charge
layers (SCLs) at interfaces and the development of interfacial stresses. The
results suggest that the SCLs and the charge transfer kinetics are intertwined.
The emergence of the SCLs and the depletion of reactants increases the charge
transfer overpotential. We have also studied the coupling between
electrochemistry and mechanics at interfaces, the results of which indicate
that the strong electric fields originating at interfaces yield significant
stresses. We, thereby, highlight the necessity of considering the ECM coupling
in the SCLs when modeling an SSB.

state. Negativity of the expectation value of an entanglement witness operator
guarantees entanglement of the corresponding state, given that the measurement
devices involved are perfect, i.e., the performed measurements actually
constitute the witness operator for the state under consideration. In a
realistic situation, there are two possible ways of measurements to drive the
process away from the ideal one. Firstly, wrong measurements may be performed,
and secondly, while the measurement operators are implemented correctly, the
detection process is noisy. Entanglement witnesses are prone to both of these
imperfections. The concept of measurement-device-independent entanglement
witnesses was introduced to remove the first problem. We analyze the ""detection

which is nonnegative in the half-space R N + , and the Dirichlet boundary

of the operator A is of order a|$\xi$| $\beta$ near the origin $\xi$ = 0, for
some $\beta$ $\in$ (0, 2], then any positive solution of the semilinear
diffusion equation blows up in finite time whenever 0 < $\alpha$ $\le$
$\beta$/(N + 1). On the other hand, we prove existence of positive global
solutions of the semilinear diffusion equation in a half-space when $\alpha$ >
$\beta$/(N + 1). Notice that in the case of the half-space, the exponent
$\beta$/(N + 1) is smaller than the so-called Fujita exponent $\beta$/N in R N.
As a consequence we can also solve the blow-up issue for solutions of the above
mentioned semilinear diffusion equation in the whole of R N , which are odd in
the x N direction (and thus sign changing).

Agents attempted to learn to track a hidden fluctuation ""source"", which,
linearly mixed with other masking fluctuations, generated observable input
vectors. Learning was driven either solely by direct observation of inputs
(unsupervised, Hebbian) or, in addition, by observation of another agent's
output (supervised, Delta rule). To enhance biological realism, the learning

additional factors some of which we outline.

case data is available, and with few exceptions, the majority of countries are
currently in the ""exponential spread stage,"" and thus there is scarce
information available which would enable one to predict the phase transition
between spread and containment.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predicting the spread of

factorization (online NMF). The key idea is to learn dictionary patterns of
short evolution instances of the new daily cases in multiple countries at the
same time, so that their latent correlation structures are captured in the
dictionary patterns. We first learn such patterns by minibatch learning from
the entire time-series and then further adapt them to the time-series by online
NMF. As we progressively adapt and improve the learned dictionary patterns to
the more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by
the partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions,
we can extrapolate our predictions into the near future. Our prediction results
can be directly attributed to the learned dictionary patterns due to their
interpretability.

maximum RMS of the attitude is 0.095{\deg}, these value are less than 15mm and
0.1{\deg} as the precision for measuring the feed cabin. For the Stewart

analytical closures, but they are approximations valid only for specific

have properties that are qualitatively distinct matter at thermal equilibrium.
However, most spectacular departures from equilibrium phase behaviour were
thought to be confined to systems with polar or nematic asymmetry. In this
paper we show that such departures are also displayed in more symmetric phases
such as hexatics if in addition the constituent particles have chiral
asymmetry. We show that chiral active hexatics whose rotation rate does not
depend on density, have giant number fluctuations. If the rotation-rate depends
on density, the giant number fluctuations are suppressed due to a novel
orientation-density sound mode with a linear dispersion which propagates even
in the overdamped limit. However, we demonstrate that beyond a finite but large
lengthscale, a chirality and activity-induced relevant nonlinearity invalidates
the predictions of the linear theory and destroys the hexatic order. In
addition, we show that activity modifies the interactions between defects in
the active chiral hexatic phase, making them non-mutual. Finally, to
demonstrate the generality of a chiral active hexatic phase we show that it
results from the melting of chiral active crystals in finite systems.

we present a comprehensive study of the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the
electronic transport properties of SrIrO3 (SIO), a system that has recently

investigations on untwinned thin films of SIO reveal that the electrical
resistivity of this material is intrinsically anisotropic and controlled by the
orthorhombic distortion of the perovskite unit cell. These effects provide
another evidence for the strong coupling between the electronic and lattice
degrees of freedom in this class of compounds. Upon increasing pressure, a
systematic increase of the transport anisotropies is observed. The anomalous
pressure-induced changes of the resistivity cannot be accounted for by the
pressure dependence of the density of the electron charge carriers, as inferred
from Hall effect measurements. Moreover, pressure-induced rotations of the IrO6
octahedra likely occur within the distorted perovskite unit cell and affect
electron mobility of this system.

apparent quiescence can be followed by repeated activity of the central
supermassive black hole. A better understanding of this cycle is crucial for
ascertaining the energetic impact that the jets have on the host galaxy, but
little is known about it. We used deep LOFAR images at 150 MHz of the Lockman
Hole extragalactic field to select a sample of 158 radio sources with sizes $>
60^{\prime\prime}$ in different phases of their jet life cycle. Using a variety
of criteria (e.g. core prominence combined with low-surface brightness of the
extended emission and steep spectrum of the central region) we selected a
subsample of candidate restarted radio galaxies representing between 13% and
15% of the 158 sources of the main sample. We compare their properties to the
rest of the sample, which consists of remnant candidates and active radio
galaxies. Optical identifications and characterisations of the host galaxies
indicate similar properties for candidate restarted, remnant, and active radio
galaxies, suggesting that they all come from the same parent population. The
fraction of restarted radio galaxies is slightly higher with respect to
remnants, suggesting that the restarted phase can often follow after a
relatively short remnant phase (the duration of the remnant phase being a few
times 10$^{7}$ years). This confirms that the remnant and restarted phases are
integral parts of the life cycle of massive elliptical galaxies. A preliminary
investigation does not suggest a strong dependence of this cycle on the
environment surrounding any given galaxy.

velocities chosen independently according to a symmetric distribution on
$\{-1,0,+1\}$, and annihilating upon collision -- with, in case of triple
collision, a uniformly random choice of survivor among the two moving
particles. When the system contains infinitely many particles, whose starting
locations are given by a renewal process, a phase transition was proved to
happen (see arXiv:1811.08709) as the density of static particles crosses the
value $1/4$. Remarkably, this critical value, along with certain other
statistics, was observed not to depend on the distribution of interdistances.
In the present paper, we investigate further this universality by proving a
stronger statement about a finite system of particles with fixed, but randomly
shuffled, interdistances. We give two proofs, one by an induction allowing
explicit computations, and one by a more direct comparison. This result entails
a new nontrivial independence property that in particular gives access to the
density of surviving static particles at a given time in the infinite model.
Finally, in the asymmetric case, further similar independence properties are
proved to keep holding, including a striking property of gamma distributed
interdistances that contrasts with the general behavior.

an axion insulator requires an energy gap at its topological surface state
(TSS). However, independent spectroscopic experiments revealed that such a

MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Here, we utilize angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
density functional theory calculations to demonstrate that a sizable TSS gap
unexpectedly exists in Sb-doped MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. This gap is found to be
topologically nontrivial, insensitive to the bulk
antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition, while enlarges along with increasing
Sb concentration. Our work shows that Mn(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_4$ is a

expressions denoting their parts according to systematic rules, a property
known as \emph{compositionality}. In this paper, we study whether the language
emerging in deep multi-agent simulations possesses a similar ability to refer
to novel primitive combinations, and whether it accomplishes this feat by
strategies akin to human-language compositionality. Equipped with new ways to
measure compositionality in emergent languages inspired by disentanglement in
representation learning, we establish three main results. First, given
sufficiently large input spaces, the emergent language will naturally develop
the ability to refer to novel composite concepts. Second, there is no
correlation between the degree of compositionality of an emergent language and
its ability to generalize. Third, while compositionality is not necessary for
generalization, it provides an advantage in terms of language transmission: The
more compositional a language is, the more easily it will be picked up by new
learners, even when the latter differ in architecture from the original agents.
We conclude that compositionality does not arise from simple generalization
pressure, but if an emergent language does chance upon it, it will be more
likely to survive and thrive.

Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) based distributed training of deep neural
network has been widely recognized as a promising approach. Compared with
server-based architecture, serverless architecture with All-Reduce (AR) and
Gossip paradigms can alleviate network congestion. To further reduce the
communication overhead, we develop Quantized-PR-SGD, a novel compression
approach for serverless learning that integrates quantization and parallel
restarted (PR) techniques to compress the exchanged information and to reduce
synchronization frequency respectively. The underlying theoretical guarantee
for the proposed compression scheme is challenging since the precision loss
incurred by quantization and the gradient deviation incurred by PR interact
with each other. Moreover, the accumulated errors that are not strictly
controlled make the training not converging in Gossip paradigm. Therefore, we
establish the bound of accumulative errors according to synchronization mode
and network topology to analyze the convergence properties of Quantized-PR-SGD.
For both AR and Gossip paradigms, theoretical results show that
Quantized-PR-SGD are at the convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{NM})$ for non-convex
objectives, where $N$ is the total number of iterations while $M$ is the number
of nodes. This indicates that Quantized-PR-SGD admits the same order of
convergence rate and achieves linear speedup with respect to the number of
nodes. Empirical study on various machine learning models demonstrates that
communication overhead has reduced by 90\%, and the convergence speed has
boosted by up to 3.2$\times$ under low bandwidth network compared with PR-SGD.

perturbative order or building phenomenological models, we follow the evolution
of the probability distribution of the displacement and velocity fields within
an approximation subspace. Keeping the exact equations of motion with their
full nonlinearity, this provides a nonperturbative scheme that goes beyond
shell crossing. Focusing on the simplest case of a curl-free Gaussian ansatz
for the displacement and velocity fields, we find that truncations of the power
spectra on nonlinear scales directly arise from the equations of motion. This
leads to a truncated Zeldovich approximation for the density power spectrum,
but with a truncation that is not set a priori and with different power spectra
for the displacement and velocity fields. The positivity of their auto power
spectra also follows from the equations of motion. Although the density power
spectrum is only recovered up to a smooth drift on BAO scales, the predicted
density correlation function agrees with numerical simulations within $2\%$
from BAO scales down to $7 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$ at $z \geq 0.35$, without any free

setting [Karger STOC'96], there was no efficient way for a distributed network
to compute its own min-cut without limiting the input structure or dropping the
output quality: In the standard CONGEST model, existing algorithms with
nearly-optimal time (e.g. [Ghaffari, Kuhn, DISC'13; Nanongkai, Su, DISC'14])
can guarantee a solution that is $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation at best while the
exact $\tilde O(n^{0.8}D^{0.2} + n^{0.9})$-time algorithm [Ghaffari, Nowicki,
Thorup, SODA'20] works only on $\textit{simple}$ networks (no weights and no
parallel edges). Throughout, $n$ and $D$ denote the network's number of
vertices and hop-diameter, respectively. For the weighted case, the best bound
was $\tilde O(n)$ [Daga et al. STOC'19].
  In this paper, we provide an $\textit{exact}$ $\tilde O(\sqrt n + D)$-time
algorithm for computing min-cut on $\textit{weighted}$ networks. Our result
improves even the previous algorithm that works only on simple networks. Its
time complexity matches the known lower bound up to polylogarithmic factors. At
the heart of our algorithm are a combination of two kinds of
tree-decompositions and a novel structural theorem that generalizes a theorem
in Mukhopadhyay-Nanongkai [STOC'20] and, in turn, helps simplify their

renewable energy sources on system operation. Ideally, the PLF calculation is
implemented for an entire grid requiring all the parameters of the transmission
lines and node load/generation to be available. However, in a multi-regional
interconnected grid, the independent system operators (ISOs) across regions may
not share the parameters of their respective areas with other ISOs.
Consequently, the challenge is how to identify the functional relationship
between the flows in the regional grid and the uncertain power injections of
renewable generation sources across regions without full information about the
entire grid. To overcome this challenge, we first propose a privacy-preserving
distributed accelerated projection-based consensus algorithm for each ISO to
calculate the corresponding coefficient matrix of the desired functional
relationship. Then, we leverage a privacy-preserving accelerated average
consensus algorithm to allow each ISO to obtain the corresponding constant
vector of the same relationship. Using the two algorithms, we finally derive a
privacy-preserving distributed PLF method for each ISO to analytically obtain
its regional joint PLF in a fully distributed manner without revealing its
parameters to other ISOs. The correctness, effectiveness, and efficiency of the
proposed method are verified through a case study on the IEEE 118-bus system.

  Ill Patients","  Pain and physical function are both essential indices of recovery in
critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Units (ICU). Simultaneous
monitoring of pain intensity and patient activity can be important for
determining which analgesic interventions can optimize mobility and function,
while minimizing opioid harm. Nonetheless, so far, our knowledge of the
relation between pain and activity has been limited to manual and sporadic
activity assessments. In recent years, wearable devices equipped with 3-axis
accelerometers have been used in many domains to provide a continuous and
automated measure of mobility and physical activity. In this study, we
collected activity intensity data from 57 ICU patients, using the Actigraph
GT3X device. We also collected relevant clinical information, including nurse
assessments of pain intensity, recorded every 1-4 hours. Our results show the
joint distribution and state transition of joint activity and pain states in
critically ill patients.

  mesh surface machining","  This paper presents a new method to generate iso-scallop tool paths for
triangular mesh surfaces. With the popularity of 3D scanning techniques,
scanning-derived mesh surfaces have seen a significant increase in their
application to machining. Quite often, such mesh surfaces exhibit defects such
as noises, which differentiate them from the good-quality mesh surfaces
previous research work focuses on. To generate tool paths for such poor-quality
mesh surfaces, the primary challenge lies in robustness against the defects. In
this work, a robust tool path generation method is proposed for poor-quality
mesh surfaces. In addition to robustness, the method is quite efficient,
providing the benefit of faster iterations and improved integration between
scanning and machining. The fundamental principle of the method is to convert
the tool path generation problem to the heat diffusion problem that has robust
and efficient algorithms available. The effectiveness of the method will be
demonstrated by a series of case studies and comparisons.

  Multitasking","  Business process simulation is a versatile technique for analyzing business
processes from a quantitative perspective. A well-known limitation of process
simulation is that the accuracy of the simulation results is limited by the
faithfulness of the process model and simulation parameters given as input to
the simulator. To tackle this limitation, several authors have proposed to
discover simulation models from process execution logs so that the resulting
simulation models more closely match reality. Existing techniques in this field
assume that each resource in the process performs one task at a time. In
reality, however, resources may engage in multitasking behavior. Traditional
simulation approaches do not handle multitasking. Instead, they rely on a
resource allocation approach wherein a task instance is only assigned to a
resource when the resource is free. This inability to handle multitasking leads
to an overestimation of execution times. This paper proposes an approach to
discover multitasking in business process execution logs and to generate a
simulation model that takes into account the discovered multitasking behavior.
The key idea is to adjust the processing times of tasks in such a way that
executing the multitasked tasks sequentially with the adjusted times is
equivalent to executing them concurrently with the original processing times.
The proposed approach is evaluated using a real-life dataset and synthetic
datasets with different levels of multitasking. The results show that, in the
presence of multitasking, the approach improves the accuracy of simulation
models discovered from execution logs.

complex mobile manipulation tasks. In a typical deep Q-learning setup, a
convolutional neural network (ConvNet) is trained to map from an image
representing the current state (e.g., a birds-eye view of a SLAM reconstruction
of the scene) to predicted Q-values for a small set of steering command actions
(step forward, turn right, turn left, etc.). Instead, we propose an action
representation in the same domain as the state: ""spatial action maps."" In our
proposal, the set of possible actions is represented by pixels of an image,
where each pixel represents a trajectory to the corresponding scene location
along a shortest path through obstacles of the partially reconstructed scene. A
significant advantage of this approach is that the spatial position of each
state-action value prediction represents a local milestone (local end-point)
for the agent's policy, which may be easily recognizable in local visual
patterns of the state image. A second advantage is that atomic actions can
perform long-range plans (follow the shortest path to a point on the other side
of the scene), and thus it is simpler to learn complex behaviors with a deep
Q-network. A third advantage is that we can use a fully convolutional network
(FCN) with skip connections to learn the mapping from state images to
pixel-aligned action images efficiently. During experiments with a robot that
learns to push objects to a goal location, we find that policies learned with
this proposed action representation achieve significantly better performance
than traditional alternatives.

Reference Sample (LARS), i.e. 14 local star-forming galaxies. We characterize
their interstellar medium and relate newly derived properties to quantities
relevant for Ly$\alpha$ escape. We observed LARS galaxies with Herschel/PACS,
SOFIA/FIFI-LS, the IRAM 30m telescope and APEX, targeting far-infrared (FIR)
continuum and emission lines of [C II]158$\mu$m, [O I]63$\mu$m, [O III]88$\mu$m
and low-J CO lines. Using Bayesian methods we derive dust model parameters and
estimate total gas masses for all LARS galaxies, taking into account a
metallicity-dependent gas-to-dust ratio. Star formation rates were estimated
from FIR, [C II]158$\mu$m and [O I]63$\mu$m luminosities. LARS covers a wide
dynamic range in the derived properties, with FIR-based star formation rates
from $\sim$0.5-100 $M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$, gas fractions between $\sim$15-80% and
gas depletion times ranging from a few hundred Myr up to more than 10 Gyr. The
distribution of LARS galaxies in the $\Sigma_{gas}$ vs. $\Sigma_{SFR}$
(Kennicutt-Schmidt plane) is thus quite heterogeneous. However, we find that
LARS galaxies with the longest gas depletion times, i.e. relatively high gas
surface densities ($\Sigma_{gas}$) and low star formation rate densities
($\Sigma_{SFR}$), have by far the highest Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction. A strong
$\sim$linear relation is found between Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and the total
gas (HI+H$_2$) depletion time. We argue that the Ly$\alpha$ escape in those
galaxies is driven by turbulence in the star-forming gas that shifts the
Ly$\alpha$ photons out of resonance close to the places where they originate.
We further report on an extreme [C II]158$\mu$m excess in LARS 5, corresponding
to $\sim$14$\pm$3% of the FIR luminosity, i.e. the most extreme [C II]-to-FIR
ratio observed in a non-AGN galaxy to date.

this by introducing a latent variable to explicitly model the aforementioned
features. This latent variable is then combined with a document representation
to guide the generation of an edited-version of this document. Additionally, to
facilitate standardized automatic evaluation of edit representations, which has
heavily relied on direct human input thus far, we also propose a suite of
downstream tasks, PEER, specifically designed to measure the quality of edit
representations in the context of Natural Language Processing.

research. Despite the evolution of deep-learning-based image and text

work, we consider the problem of accurate image-text matching for the task of
multi-modal large-scale information retrieval. State-of-the-art results in
image-text matching are achieved by inter-playing image and text features from
the two different processing pipelines, usually using mutual attention
mechanisms. However, this invalidates any chance to extract separate visual and
textual features needed for later indexing steps in large-scale retrieval
systems. In this regard, we introduce the Transformer Encoder Reasoning Network
(TERN), an architecture built upon one of the modern relationship-aware
self-attentive architectures, the Transformer Encoder (TE). This architecture
is able to separately reason on the two different modalities and to enforce a
final common abstract concept space by sharing the weights of the deeper
transformer layers. Thanks to this design, the implemented network is able to
produce compact and very rich visual and textual features available for the
successive indexing step. Experiments are conducted on the MS-COCO dataset, and
we evaluate the results using a discounted cumulative gain metric with
relevance computed exploiting caption similarities, in order to assess possibly
non-exact but relevant search results. We demonstrate that on this metric we
are able to achieve state-of-the-art results in the image retrieval task. Our

model operational scenarios at a one-hour resolution, where deviations of
stochastic loads and renewable generation (modeled through scenarios) from a
day-ahead unit commitment and violations of grid constraints are compensated by
either dispatchable power plants (conventional reserves) or injections from
battery energy storage systems. By plugging-in costs of conventional reserves
and capital costs of converter power ratings and energy storage capacity, the
model is able to derive requirements for storage deployment that achieve the
technical-economical optimum of the problem. The method leverages an efficient
linearized formulation of the grid constraints of both the HV (High Voltage)
and MV (Medium Voltage) grids while still retaining fundamental modeling
aspects of the power system (such as transmission losses, effect of reactive

is a combined effect of multiple cosmetics and tailored treatments should be
imposed on different cosmetic regions. To this end, we present both
unsupervised and supervised semantic-aware learning strategies in SAMC. At
image level, an unsupervised attention module is jointly learned with the
generator to locate cosmetic regions and estimate the degree. At feature level,
we resort to the effort of face parsing merely in training phase and design a
localized texture loss to serve complements and pursue superior synthetic
quality. The experimental results on four makeuprelated datasets verify that
SAMC not only produces appealing de-makeup outputs at a resolution of 256*256,
but also facilitates makeup-invariant face verification through image
generation.

reveals that the higher the order of the information density moment that can be

defined as galaxy groups with an X-ray luminosity higher than $10^{42}\
h_{50}^{-2}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a brightest group galaxy brighter than the other
group members by at least 2 magnitudes. However, the scenario of their
formation remains controversial. We propose here a probabilistic analysis of
FGs, extracted from the large catalogue of candidate groups and clusters
detected by Sarron et al. (2018) in the CFHTLS survey, based on photometric
redshifts, to investigate their position in the cosmic web and probe their
environment. Based on spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, we estimate the
probability of galaxies to belong to a galaxy structure, and by imposing the
condition that the brightest group galaxy is at least brighter than the others
by 2 magnitudes, we compute the probability for a given galaxy structure to be
a FG. We analyse the mass distribution of these candidate FGs, and estimate
their distance to the filaments and nodes of the cosmic web in which they are
embedded. We find that the structures with masses lower than $2.4\times
10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ have the highest probabilities of being fossil groups (PFG).
Overall, structures with PFG$\geq$50% are located close to the cosmic web
filaments (87% are located at less than 1 Mpc from their nearest filament).
They are preferentially four times more distant from their nearest node than
from their nearest filament. We confirm that FGs have small masses and are
rare. They seem to reside closeby cosmic filaments and do not survive in nodes.
Being in a poor environment could therefore be the driver of FG formation, the
number of nearby galaxies not being sufficient to compensate for the
cannibalism of the central group galaxy.

QED device. In chapter 3 we cover two experimental approaches to increasing the
coupling in a circuit QED system, one making use of a high impedance resonator,
the second utilizing a large coupling capacitor. In chapter 4, we combine these
two approaches to implement RFcQED. Through strong dispersive coupling, we
could measure individual photons in a megahertz resonator, demonstrate quantum
control by cooling the resonator to the ground state or preparing Fock states,
and finally observe with nanosecond resolution the re-thermalization of these
states. In chapter 5 we present QuCAT or Quantum Circuit Analyzer Tool in
Python, a software package that can be used for the design of circuit QED
systems such as the one presented in this thesis. In chapter 6 we discuss how
certain interplays between general relativity and quantum mechanics cannot be
described using our current laws of physics. In particular, we show how
radio-frequency mechanical oscillators are perfect candidates to perform
experiments in this regime. In chapter 7 we present the prospects for coupling
such mechanical oscillator to weakly anharmonic superconducting circuits such
as the transmon qubit or RFcQED systems.

which each unit adjusts their rhythms to achieve synchrony through mutual
interactions. The optomechanical systems, due to their inherently engineerable
nonlinearities, provide an ideal platform to study self-organized
synchronization. Here, we demonstrate the self-organized synchronization of
phonon lasers in a two-membrane-in-the-middle optomechanical system. The probe
of individual membrane enables to monitor the real-time transient dynamics of
synchronization, which reveal that the system enters into the synchronization
regime via torus birth bifurcation line. The phase-locking phenomenon and the
transition between in-phase and anti-phase regimes are directly observed.
Moreover, such a system greatly facilitate the controllable synchronous states,
and consequently a phononic memory is realized by tuning the system parameters.
This result is an important step towards the future studies of many-body
collective behaviors in multiresonator optomechanics with long distances, and
might find potential applications in quantum information processing and complex
networks.

frequency comb (OFC) in a standard cavity optomechanical system (COMS) driven
by three laser-fields, including a control field $\omega_{c}$ and two probe
fields $\omega_{p}$ and $\omega_{f}$. The detuning between $\omega_{c}$ and
$\omega_{p}$ ($\omega_{f}$) is equal to the mechanical frequency $\omega_{b}$
($\omega_{b}/n$), where $n$ is a positive integer number, and the intensities
of the probe fields are as strong as that of the control field. Due to the
optomechanical nonlinearity, the driving energy will be transferred to a series
of sidebands, including integer-order, fraction-order, sum and difference
sidebands, which constitute an optomechanically induced sideband comb (OMSC).
The spectral range and repetition frequency of the OMSC are proportional to the
sideband cutoff-order number and interval, respectively. We show that by
increasing the intensity of the probe field $\omega_{p}$, we can extend the
sideband cutoff-order number and sequentially enlarge the spectral range of
OMSC. By increasing the intensity of probe field $\omega_{f}$ and decreasing
its detuning with control field, we can reduce the sideband interval and
consequently decrease the repetition frequency of OMSC. Our work paves the way

interactions between nodes. Recent advances have been made to incorporate
multiple types of interactions, thus generalising standard methods to
multilayer networks. Often though, one can access additional information
regarding individual nodes, attributes or covariates. A relevant question is
thus how to properly incorporate this extra information in such frameworks.
Here we develop a method that incorporates both the topology of interactions
and node attributes to extract communities in multilayer networks. We propose a
principled probabilistic method that does not assume any a priori correlation
structure between attributes and communities but rather infers this from data.
This leads to an efficient algorithmic implementation that exploits the
sparsity of the dataset and can be used to perform several inference tasks; we
provide an open-source implementation of the code online. We demonstrate our
method on both synthetic and real-world data and compare performance with
methods that do not use any attribute information. We find that including node
information helps in predicting missing links or attributes. It also leads to
more interpretable community structures and allows the quantification of the
impact of the node attributes given in input.

be evaluated by means of the solution of an elliptic quasi-stationary boundary
value problem. When eliminating the control, we end up with the reduced
optimality system that is nothing but the variational formulation of the

establish the discrete inf-sup condition for any conforming space-time finite

Various numerical examples confirm the theoretical findings. We emphasize that
the energy regularization results in a more localized control with sharper

approach.

increase significantly owing to the higher degree of $p-d$ hybridization and

has given access to realize a plethora of ultralow power and fast spintronic
devices such as non-volatile magnetic memories, spin-torque nano-oscillators,
and neuromorphic computing devices. Recent advances have led to the notion that
relativistic spin-orbit coupling is an efficient source for current-induced
torques, opening the field of spin-orbitronics. Despite the significant
progress, however, the fundamental mechanism of magnetization manipulation, the
requirement of spin currents in generating current-induced torques, has
remained unchanged. Here, we demonstrate the generation of current-induced
torques without the use of spin currents. By measuring the current-induced
torque for naturally-oxidized-Cu/ferromagnetic-metal bilayers, we observed an
exceptionally high effective spin Hall conductivity at low temperatures despite
the absence of strong spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we found that the
direction of the torque depends on the choice of the ferromagnetic layer, which
counters the conventional understanding of the current-induced torque. These
unconventional features are best interpreted in terms of an orbital counterpart
of the spin torque, an orbital torque, which arises from the orbital Rashba
effect and orbital current. These findings will shed light on the underlying
physics of current-induced magnetization manipulation, potentially altering the
landscape of spin-orbitronics.

Parametric timed automata (PTAs) are a classical formalism for such systems but
for which most interesting problems are undecidable. Notably, the parametric
reachability emptiness problem, i.e., whether at least one parameter valuation
allows to reach some given discrete state, is undecidable.
Lower-bound/upper-bound parametric timed automata (L/U-PTAs) achieve
decidability for reachability properties by enforcing a separation of
parameters used as upper bounds in the automaton constraints, and those used as
lower bounds.
  In this paper, we first study reachability. We exhibit a subclass of PTAs
(namely integer-points PTAs) with bounded rational-valued parameters for which
the parametric reachability emptiness problem is decidable. Using this class,
we present further results improving the boundary between decidability and
undecidability for PTAs and their subclasses such as L/U-PTAs.
  We then study liveness. We prove that:
  (1) the existence of at least one parameter valuation for which there exists
an infinite run in an L/U-PTA is PSPACE-complete;
  (2) the existence of a parameter valuation such that the system has a
deadlock is however undecidable;
  (3) the problem of the existence of a valuation for which a run remains in a
given set of locations exhibits a very thin border between decidability and
undecidability.

component of the velocity. The objective in this problem is the reaching of the
laminar regime in a minimum time, as well as its preservation after this time.
The determination of the necessary conditions of optimality relies on the
analysis of intermediate minimal time control problems $(P_{k})$ for the
Fourier modes $""k""$ associated to the Navier-Stokes equations and on the proof
of the maximum principle for them. Also it is found that one can construct, on
the basis of the optimal controllers of problems $(P_{k}),$ a small time called
here \textit{quasi minimal} and a boundary controller which realizes the
required objective in $% (P).$

membranes made of polydisperse polymer networks for molecular penetrant
transport, using coarse-grained, implicit-solvent computer simulations. The
permeability $\mathcal P$ is determined on the linear-response level using the
solution-diffusion model, $\mathcal P = {\mathcal K}D_\text{in}$,
$\textit{i.e.}$, by calculating the equilibrium penetrant partition ratio
$\mathcal K$ and penetrant diffusivity $D_\text{in}$ inside the membrane. We
vary two key parameters, namely the monomer-monomer interaction, which controls
the degree of swelling and collapse of the network, and the monomer-penetrant
interaction, which tunes the penetrant uptake and microscopic energy landscape
for diffusive transport. The results for the partition ratio $\mathcal K$ cover
four orders of magnitude and are non-monotonic versus the parameters, which is
well interpreted by a second-order virial expansion of the free energy of
transferring one penetrant from bulk into the polymeric medium. We find that
the penetrant diffusivity $D_\text{in}$ in the polydisperse networks, in
contrast to highly ordered membrane structures, exhibits relatively simple
exponential decays and obeys well-known free-volume and Kramers' escape scaling
laws. The eventually resulting permeability $\mathcal P$ thus resembles the
qualitative functional behavior (including maximization and minimization) of
the partitioning. However, partitioning and diffusion are anti-correlated,
yielding large quantitative cancellations, controlled and fine-tuned by the
network density and interactions as rationalized by our scaling laws. As a
consequence, we finally demonstrate that even small changes of
penetrant-network interactions, $\textit{e.g.}$, by half a $k_\text{B}T$,
modify the permselectivity of the membrane by almost one order of magnitude.

This paper considers a fog-based IoT network, in which active IoT devices
transmit measurements of the monitored QoIs to the local edge node (EN), while
the ENs are connected to a cloud processor via limited-capacity fronthaul
links. While the conventional approach uses preambles as metadata for reserving

to be advantageous when the inter-cell interference power and the fronthaul

adjustment sets, equally valid from a theoretical perspective, leading to
identical causal effects. However, in practice, with finite data, estimators
built on different sets may display different precision. To investigate the
extent of this variability we consider the simplest non-trivial non-linear
model of a v-structure on three nodes for binary data. We explicitly compute

Further, by going beyond leading order asymptotics we show that there are

of electrical devices such as coils, motors, relays, solenoids and transformers
is heavily dependent on the Electrical Insulation System (EIS). Accelerated
aging methods are used to rapidly simulate the conditions in real life, which
is typically years (20,000 hours) depending on the operating conditions. The
purpose of accelerated aging is to bring lifetime of an EIS to hours, days or
weeks. Shortening the lifetime of an EIS to such an extent, allows for the
study of the insulation materials behavior as well as investigate ways to
estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for the purpose of predictive
maintenance. Unexpected failures in operation processes, where redundancy is
not present, can lead to high economical losses, machine downtime and often
health and safety risks. Conditions, under which thermal aging methods are
generally reported in the literature, typically neglect other factors, owing to
the sheer complexity and interdependence of the multifaceted aging phenomena.
This paper examines some existing thermal aging tests, which are currently used
to obtain data for enamel degradation in order to try to better understand of
how the thermal stresses degrade the EIS. Separation of these stresses, which
the EIS operate under, can yield a better understanding of how each of the
Thermal, the Electrical, the Ambient and the Mechanical (TEAM) stresses behave.

variational inference, whose optimization usually converges into a trivial
local optimum termed posterior collapse, especially in text modeling. By
tracking the optimization dynamics, we observe the encoder-decoder
incompatibility that leads to poor parameterizations of the data manifold. We
argue that the trivial local optimum may be avoided by improving the encoder
and decoder parameterizations since the posterior network is part of a
transition map between them. To this end, we propose Coupled-VAE, which couples
a VAE model with a deterministic autoencoder with the same structure and
improves the encoder and decoder parameterizations via encoder weight sharing
and decoder signal matching. We apply the proposed Coupled-VAE approach to
various VAE models with different regularization, posterior family, decoder
structure, and optimization strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e.,
PTB, Yelp, and Yahoo) show consistently improved results in terms of
probability estimation and richness of the latent space. We also generalize our
method to conditional language modeling and propose Coupled-CVAE, which largely
improves the diversity of dialogue generation on the Switchboard dataset.

  Software-Based Network","  Network virtualization is a way to simultaneously run multiple heterogeneous
architectures on a shared substrate. The main issue in network virtualization
is mapping virtual networks to substrate network. How to manage substrate
resources in mapping phase will have an effective role in improving the use of
infrastructure resources. Using software-based networks in network
virtualization which separates control logic from data as a new technology, has
led to efficient resource management in this context. In this article a
software-based network approach has been presented to network virtualization
and manage infrastructure resources efficiently. It optimizes mapping function
by dynamic resource management of infrastructure resource. We have added a
module in the controller to manage the resources dynamically. An initial
mapping will be done for arriving new requests based on number of successful
requests and arriving time slots. They will not be finalized by writing the
rules in the switches before arriving n requests. If some remapping during the
n time window is needed, remapping can be done by the controller and the final
results are sent to the switches to write the flow rules. The simulation has
been done using NS2 simulator showed based on different evaluation criteria
such as acceptance rate, average link utilization, cost and delay. Keywords:

  scenarios","  A standard approach to quantifying resources is to determine which operations
on the resources are freely available and to deduce the ordering relation among
the resources that these operations induce. If the resource of interest is the
nonclassicality of the correlations embodied in a quantum state, that is,
entanglement, then it is typically presumed that the appropriate choice of free
operations is local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We here
argue that, in spite of the near-universal endorsement of the LOCC paradigm by
the quantum information community, this is the wrong choice for one of the most
prominent applications of entanglement theory, namely, the study of Bell
scenarios. The nonclassicality of correlations in such scenarios, we argue,
should be quantified instead by local operations and shared randomness (LOSR).
We support this thesis by showing that various perverse features of the
interplay between entanglement and nonlocality are merely an artifact of the
use of LOCC-entanglement and that the interplay between LOSR-entanglement and
nonlocality is natural and intuitive. Specifically, we show that the LOSR
paradigm (i) provides a resolution of the ""anomaly of nonlocality"", wherein
partially entangled states exhibit more nonlocality than maximally entangled
states, (ii) entails a notion of genuine multipartite entanglement that is
distinct from the conventional one and which is free of several of its
pathological features, and (iii) makes possible a resource-theoretic account of
the self-testing of entangled states which simplifies and generalizes prior
results. Along the way, we derive some fundamental results concerning the
necessary and sufficient conditions for convertibility between pure entangled
states under LOSR and highlight some of their consequences, such as the
impossibility of catalysis for bipartite pure states.

while neural networks fail due to catastrophic forgetting between new and
previously-learned tasks. We consider a class-incremental setting which means
that the task-ID is unknown at inference time. The imbalance between old and
new classes typically results in a bias of the network towards the newest ones.
This imbalance problem can either be addressed by storing exemplars from
previous tasks, or by using image replay methods. However, the latter can only
be applied to toy datasets since image generation for complex datasets is a
hard problem.
  We propose a solution to the imbalance problem based on generative feature
replay which does not require any exemplars. To do this, we split the network
into two parts: a feature extractor and a classifier. To prevent forgetting, we
combine generative feature replay in the classifier with feature distillation
in the feature extractor. Through feature generation, our method reduces the
complexity of generative replay and prevents the imbalance problem. Our
approach is computationally efficient and scalable to large datasets.
Experiments confirm that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, while requiring only a fraction of the storage needed

vertical, rotating cylinder is investigated. This is performed using
two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) direct numerical simulations,
with a volume-of-fluid approach to treat the interface. The problem is
parameterised by the Reynolds, Froude, Weber and Ekman numbers. The variation
of the Ekman number ($Ek$), defined to be proportional of the rotational speed
of the cylinder, has a strong effect on the flow characteristics. Simulations
are conducted over a wide range of $Ek$ values ($0 \leq Ek \leq 484$) in order
to provide detailed insight into how this parameter influences the flow. Our
results indicate that increasing $Ek$, which leads to a rise in the magnitude
of centrifugal forces, produces a stabilising effect, suppressing wave
formation. Key flow features, such as the transition from a 2D to a more
complex 3D wave regime, are influenced significantly by this stabilisation, and
are investigated in detail. Furthermore, the imposed rotation results in
distinct flow characteristics such as the development of angled waves, which
arise due to the combination of gravitationally- and centrifugally-driven
motion in the axial and azimuthal directions, respectively. We also use a
weighted residuals integral boundary layer method to determine a boundary in
the space of Reynolds and Ekman numbers that represents a threshold beyond
which waves have recirculation regions.

the presence of an arbitrary external magnetic field using the 2-flavour
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of the
quarks is taken into consideration while calculating the constituent quark mass
as well as the DPR from the thermo-magnetic medium. An infinite number of quark
Landau levels is incorporated so that no approximations are made on the
strength of the background magnetic field. The analytic structure of the two
point vector current correlation function in the complex energy plane reveals
that, in addition to the usual Unitary cut, a non-trival Landau cut appears in
the physical kinematic domains solely due to the external magnetic field.
Moreover, these kinematic domains of the Unitary and Landau cuts are found to
be significantly modified due to the AMM of the quarks. With finite AMM of the
quarks, for certain values of the external magnetic field, the kinematically
forbidden gap between the Unitary and Landau cuts are shown to vanish leading
to the generation of continuous spectrum of dilepton emission over the whole
invariant mass region not observed earlier.

and the neutral fraction maps can be well reproduced at large scales.
Furthermore, we show that the cross correlation is detectable at $k < 0.2~{\rm

possible. The review of the available literature shows that in order to make a
system more tractable most of the solution methods use left preconditioning of
the system by the midpoint inverse. Surprisingly, and in contrast to standard
interval linear systems, our investigations have shown that double
preconditioning can be more efficient than a single one, both in terms of
checking the regularity of the system matrix and enclosing the solution set.
Consequently, right (which was hitherto mentioned in the context of checking
regularity of interval parametric matrices) and double preconditioning together
with the p-solution concept enable us to solve a larger class of interval
parametric linear systems than most of existing methods. The applicability of
the proposed approach to solving interval parametric linear systems is
illustrated by several numerical examples.

of dynamic scenes using times of arrival of photons recorded by single-photon
detector arrays. One of the main challenges in 3D imaging using single-photon
lidar in practical applications is the presence of strong ambient illumination
which corrupts the data and can jeopardize the detection of peaks/surface in
the signals. This background noise not only complicates the observation model
classically used for 3D reconstruction but also the estimation procedure which
requires iterative methods. In this work, we consider a new similarity measure
for robust depth estimation, which allows us to use a simple observation model
and a non-iterative estimation procedure while being robust to
mis-specification of the background illumination model. This choice leads to a
computationally attractive depth estimation procedure without significant
degradation of the reconstruction performance. This new depth estimation
procedure is coupled with a spatio-temporal model to capture the natural
correlation between neighboring pixels and successive frames for dynamic scene
analysis. The resulting online inference process is scalable and well suited
for parallel implementation. The benefits of the proposed method are
demonstrated through a series of experiments conducted with simulated and real
single-photon lidar videos, allowing the analysis of dynamic scenes at 325 m
observed under extreme ambient illumination conditions.

  Recognition","  Egocentric gestures are the most natural form of communication for humans to
interact with wearable devices such as VR/AR helmets and glasses. A major issue
in such scenarios for real-world applications is that may easily become
necessary to add new gestures to the system e.g., a proper VR system should
allow users to customize gestures incrementally. Traditional deep learning
methods require storing all previous class samples in the system and training
the model again from scratch by incorporating previous samples and new samples,
which costs humongous memory and significantly increases computation over time.
In this work, we demonstrate a lifelong 3D convolutional framework --
c(C)la(a)ss increment(t)al net(Net)work (CatNet), which considers temporal
information in videos and enables lifelong learning for egocentric gesture
video recognition by learning the feature representation of an exemplar set
selected from previous class samples. Importantly, we propose a two-stream
CatNet, which deploys RGB and depth modalities to train two separate networks.
We evaluate CatNets on a publicly available dataset -- EgoGesture dataset, and
show that CatNets can learn many classes incrementally over a long period of
time. Results also demonstrate that the two-stream architecture achieves the
best performance on both joint training and class incremental training compared
to 3 other one-stream architectures. The codes and pre-trained models used in

  Language Games","  The question of how an effective and efficient communication system can
emerge in a population of agents that need to solve a particular task attracts
more and more attention from researchers in many fields, including artificial
intelligence, linguistics and statistical physics. A common methodology for
studying this question consists of carrying out multi-agent experiments in
which a population of agents takes part in a series of scripted and
task-oriented communicative interactions, called 'language games'. While each
individual language game is typically played by two agents in the population, a
large series of games allows the population to converge on a shared
communication system. Setting up an experiment in which a rich system for
communicating about the real world emerges is a major enterprise, as it
requires a variety of software components for running multi-agent experiments,
for interacting with sensors and actuators, for conceptualising and
interpreting semantic structures, and for mapping between these semantic
structures and linguistic utterances. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the
one hand, it introduces a high-level robot interface that extends the Babel
software system, presenting for the first time a toolkit that provides flexible
modules for dealing with each subtask involved in running advanced grounded
language game experiments. On the other hand, it provides a practical guide to
using the toolkit for implementing such experiments, taking a grounded colour

bands. Our finding provides a new insight to the topological manipulation of
matters by utilizing CDWs' flexible characters to external stimuli.

temporal correlations. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learned system
for compressing video frames. Instead of relying on pixel-space motion (as with
optical flow), our system learns deep embeddings of frames and encodes their
difference in latent space. At decoder-side, an attention mechanism is designed
to attend to the latent space of frames to decide how different parts of the
previous and current frame are combined to form the final predicted current
frame. Spatially-varying channel allocation is achieved by using importance
masks acting on the feature-channels. The model is trained to reduce the
bitrate by minimizing a loss on importance maps and a loss on the probability
output by a context model for arithmetic coding. In our experiments, we show
that the proposed system achieves high compression rates and high objective
visual quality as measured by MS-SSIM and PSNR. Furthermore, we provide
ablation studies where we highlight the contribution of different components.

assignment in the resulting standard genetic code. It shows how norleucine,
pyrrolysine, selenocysteine and two other unknown amino acids, included into
the prebiotic codes, disappeared after the fusion. The properties of these two
missing amino acids were described. The ambiguous translation observed in
mitochondria is explained. The internal structure of the codes allows a more
detailed insights into molecular evolution in prebiotic time. In particular,
the structure of the oldest single base-pair code is presented. The fusion
concept reveals the appearance of the DNA machinery on the level of the single
dominant AU-code. The time before the appearance of standard genetic code is
divided into four epochs: pre-DNA, 2-code, pre-fusion, and after-fusion epochs.
The prebiotic single-base-pair codes may help design novel peptide-based

  Robots","  Selectively picking a target fruit surrounded by obstacles is one of the
major challenges for fruit harvesting robots. Different from traditional
obstacle avoidance methods, this paper presents an active obstacle separation
strategy that combines push and drag motions. The separation motion and
trajectory are generated based on the 3D visual perception of the obstacle
information around the target. A linear push is used to clear the obstacles
from the area below the target, while a zig-zag push that contains several
linear motions is proposed to push aside more dense obstacles. The zig-zag push
can generate multi-directional pushes and the side-to-side motion can break the
static contact force between the target and obstacles, thus helping the gripper
to receive a target in more complex situations. Moreover, we propose a novel
drag operation to address the issue of mis-capturing obstacles located above
the target, in which the gripper drags the target to a place with fewer
obstacles and then pushes back to move the obstacles aside for further
detachment. Furthermore, an image processing pipeline consisting of color
thresholding, object detection using deep learning and point cloud operation,
is developed to implement the proposed method on a harvesting robot. Field
tests show that the proposed method can improve the picking performance
substantially. This method helps to enable complex clusters of fruits to be
harvested with a higher success rate than conventional methods.

input quantum states, while quantum illumination has a goal of enhancing a
target detection capability with input entangled states in a heavy noise
environment. Here we propose a concatenation between quantum-enhanced sensing
and quantum illumination that can take quantum advantage over the classical
limit. Using quantum Fisher information formula, we connect quantum phase
sensing in an interferometry with sensing a target reflectivity that we call a
target sensitivity. Including thermal noise and loss, we put the target
sensitivity into noisy quantum-enhanced sensing. Under the constraint of a
total input state energy, for example, N-photon entangled states can exhibit
better performance than a two-mode squeezed vacuum state and a separable
coherent state. Incorporating a photon-number difference measurement that
discriminates the presence and absence of the target distinctly, we enhance not
only the target sensitivity but also the signal-to-noise ratio with increasing
thermal noise.

to accurately perform genetic edits. While empirical models predict off-target
effects in specific platforms, there is a gap for a wide-ranging mechanistic
model of CRISPR systems based on evidence from the essential processes of
target recognition. In this work, we present a first principles model supported
by many experiments performed in vivo and in vitro. First, we observe and model
the conformational changes and discrete stepped DNA unwinding events of
SpCas9-CRISPR target recognition process in a cell-free
transcription-translation system using truncated guide RNAs, confirming
structural and FRET microscopy experiments. Second, we implement an energy
landscape to describe single mismatch effects observed in vivo for spCas9 and
Cas12a CRISPR systems. From the mismatch analysis results we uncover that
CRISPR class 2 systems maintain their kinetic proofreading mechanism by
utilizing intermittent energetic barriers and we show how to leverage the
landscape to improve target specificity.

approximate within some multiplicative constant the average size of an
independent set in graphs of maximum degree 6. This is a special case of a more
general result for the hard-core model defined on independent sets weighted by
a parameter $\lambda>0$. In the general setting, we prove that, unless P=NP,
for all $\Delta\geq 3$, all $\lambda>\lambda_c(\Delta)$, there is no FPTAS
which applies to all graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ for computing the
average size of the independent set in the Gibbs distribution, where
$\lambda_c(\Delta)$ is the critical point for the uniqueness/non-uniqueness
phase transition on the $\Delta$-regular tree. Moreover, we prove that for
$\lambda$ in a dense set of this non-uniqueness region the problem is NP-hard
to approximate within some constant factor. Our work extends to the
antiferromagnetic Ising model and generalizes to all 2-spin antiferromagnetic
models, establishing hardness of computing the average magnetization in the
tree non-uniqueness region.
  Previously, Schulman, Sinclair and Srivastava (2015) showed that it is
#P-hard to compute the average magnetization exactly, but no hardness of
approximation results were known. Hardness results of Sly (2010) and Sly and
Sun (2014) for approximating the partition function do not imply hardness of
computing averages. The new ingredient in our reduction is an intricate
construction of pairs of rooted trees whose marginal distributions at the root
agree but their derivatives disagree. The main technical contribution is
controlling what marginal distributions and derivatives are achievable and
using Cauchy's functional equation to argue existence of the gadgets.

dominates over attraction due to mass for large $r$ in dimensions $>5$. This
gives rise to a remarkable result that black hole in these higher dimensions in
contrast to lower dimensional ones cannot be overspun even under linear test
particle accretion. Further if a black hole in dimension $>4$ has one of its
rotation parameters zero, it has only one horizon and hence it can never be
overspun. Thus rotating black holes in six and higher dimensions, and those
with one rotation parameter switched off, would always obey the weak cosmic

exceptional Hermite polynomials. That is, we derive an ordinary differential
equation associated with a specific family of exceptional polynomials of
codimension two. We show that these polynomials can be expressed in terms of
classical Hermite polynomials. Based on this fact, we demonstrate that there
exists a link between the norm of an exceptional Hermite polynomial and the gap
sequence arising from the partition used to construct this polynomial. We find
the analytical general solution of the exceptional Hermite differential
equation which has no gap in its spectrum. We show that the spectrum is
completed by non-polynomial solutions, and that the exceptional Hermite
polynomials of odd and even degrees correspond respectively to the odd and even
powers of a series that is part of the general solution. The paper contains a
detailed exposition of the theory of exceptional Hermite polynomials as well as
an exposition of the main tool used to construct their associated minimal
surfaces obtained through the Enneper-Weierstrass immersion representation. We
present 3D numerical displays of these surfaces. Several examples of minimal
surfaces are included as illustrations of the presented theoretical results.

  weighted sup-norm spaces of holomorphic functions","  We prove sufficient conditions for the boundedness and compactness of
Toeplitz operators $T_a$ in weighted sup-normed Banach spaces $H_v^\infty$ of
holomorphic functions defined on the open unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ of the complex
plane; both the weights $v$ and symbols $a$ are assumed to be radial functions
on $\mathbb{D}$. In an earlier work by the authors it was shown that there
exists a bounded, harmonic (thus non-radial) symbol $a$ such that $T_a$ is not
bounded in any space $H_v^\infty$ with an admissible weight $v$. Here, we show
that a mild additional assumption on the logarithmic decay rate of a radial
symbol $a$ at the boundary of $\mathbb{D} $ guarantees the boundedness of
$T_a$.
  The sufficient conditions for the boundedness and compactness of $T_a$, in a
number of variations, are derived from the general, abstract necessary and
sufficient condition recently found by the authors. The results apply for a
large class of weights satisfying the so called condition$(B)$, which includes
in addition to standard weight classes also many rapidly decreasing weights.
  Our methods are also applied to study the boundedness of the Bergman
projection in weighted spaces. We show that in the case of exponentially
decreasing weights $v$, the Bergman (orthogonal) projection of the weighted
space $L_w^2$ is bounded in the space $L_v^\infty$ for $w = v^{1+ \delta}$ with
any $\delta > (1- \sqrt{2})^2/2 \approx 0.0858$. This should be compared with
the well-known result of Dostani\'c that for such weights, the Bergman
projection of $L_v^2$ is never bounded in any space $L_v^p$ with $1 \leq p \leq
\infty$, $p \not=2$.

Sampling (TS) heuristic have recently been proposed. However, finite-time
analysis of constrained TS is challenging; as a result, only O(\sqrt{T}) bounds
on the cumulative reward loss (i.e., the regret) are available. In this paper,
we describe LinConTS, a TS-based algorithm for bandits that place a linear
constraint on the probability of earning a reward in every round. We show that
for LinConTS, the regret as well as the cumulative constraint violations are
upper bounded by O(\log T). We develop a proof technique that relies on careful
analysis of the dual problem and combine it with recent theoretical work on
unconstrained TS. Through numerical experiments on two real-world datasets, we
demonstrate that LinConTS outperforms an asymptotically optimal upper

  of Multi-scale Rarefied Gas flows","  This paper presents a general synthetic iteration scheme (GSIS) for efficient
steady-state solution of the non-linear gas kinetic equation. The GSIS has been
recently developed for steady-state solution of the linearized Boltzmann
equation and demonstrated its computational efficiency for multiscale rarefied
flow, which can achieve converged solutions within a few dozens of iteration
steps. The key ingredient of GSIS is to solve the synthetic macroscopic
equations after each iteration step for solving the gas-kinetic equation using
the discrete velocity method (DVM). The constitutive relations for shear stress
and heat flux, i.e., Newton's law and Fourier's law are explicitly included in
the macroscopic equations. The contributions of the higher-order velocity
moments to shear stress and heat flux are calculated from the updated velocity
distribution function. This synthetic coupling can resolve the long-standing
problems of the conventional for low-Knudsen-number flows, i.e. extremely slow
convergence and requirement of ultra-fine grids. In this paper, the synthetic
macroscopic equations are implicitly solved after each DVM step to steady-state
using the lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) technique. The spatial
discretization in both the DVM and macroscopic solvers uses the existing
conventional schemes without complex evaluation of numerical fluxes at the cell
interfaces. Although the non-linear GSIS algorithm presented here uses the
Shakhov model equation as an example, it can be used to solve the full
Boltzmann equation and other model equations. The efficiency and accuracy of
the non-linear GSIS are demonstrated by a range of two-dimensional flows in
various regimes.

Markovianity on the level of quantum evolution. Divisible maps provide
important generalization of Markovian semigroups. Usually one analyzes either
completely positive or just positive divisibility meaning that the
corresponding propagators are defined in terms of completely positive or
positive maps, respectively. For maps which are invertible at any moment of
time the very existence of propagator is already guaranteed and hence the only
issue is (complete) positivity and trace-preservation. However, for maps which
are not invertible the problem is much more involved since even the existence
of a propagator is not guaranteed. In this paper we propose a simple method to
construct propagators of dynamical maps using the concept of generalized
inverse. We analyze both time-continuous and time-discrete maps. Since the
generalized inverse is not uniquely defined the same applies for the
corresponding propagator. In simple examples of qubit evolution we analyze it
turns out that additional requirement of complete positivity possibly makes the
propagator unique.

light fields and matter, also known as acoustic phonons, have long been a
subject of study. In recent years, specially designed functional devices have
been developed to enhance the light-matter interaction strength, since the
excitation of acoustic phonons by a continuous wave laser alone is
insufficient. However, with such structure-dependent enhancements, the strength
of the interaction cannot be aptly and instantly controlled. We propose a new
technique to control the effective interaction strength, which is not via the

resources of computational devices with increasing input sizes. Quantum
annealers (QA) are physical devices that aim at this class of problems by
exploiting quantum mechanical properties of nature. However, they compete with
efficient heuristics and probabilistic or randomised algorithms on classical
machines that allow for finding approximate solutions to large NP-complete
problems. While first implementations of QA have become commercially available,
their practical benefits are far from fully explored. To the best of our
knowledge, approximation techniques have not yet received substantial
attention. In this paper, we explore how problems' approximate versions of
varying degree can be systematically constructed for quantum annealer programs,
and how this influences result quality or the handling of larger problem
instances on given set of qubits. We illustrate various approximation
techniques on both, simulations and real QA hardware, on different seminal

understanding of the real-world power and limitations of current-state and

very cold surface, is naturally followed by the growth of an ice layer and ends
up with a water rivulet flowing on a static thin ice wall. The structure of
this final ice layer presents a surprising linear shape that thickens with the
distance. This paper presents a theoretical model and experimental
characterisation of the ice growth dynamics, the final ice shape and the
temperature fields. In a first part, we establish a 2D model, based on the
advection-diffusion heat equations, that allows us to predict the shape of the
ice structure and the temperature fields in both the water and the ice. Then,
we study experimentally the formation of the ice layer and we show that both
the transient dynamics and the final shape are well captured by the model. In a
last part, we characterise experimentally the temperature fields in the ice and
in the water, using an infrared camera. The model shows an excellent agreement
with the experimental fields. In particular, it predicts well the linear
decrease of the water surface temperature observed along the plane, confirming
that the final ice shape is a consequence of the interaction between the
thermal boundary layer and the free surface.

low emitter-density diffraction-limited images enables high-precision emitter
localization. However, this is achieved at the cost of lengthy imaging times,
limiting temporal resolution. In recent years, a variety of approaches have
been suggested to reduce imaging times, ranging from classical optimization and
statistical algorithms to deep learning methods. Classical methods often rely
on prior knowledge of the optical system and require heuristic adjustment of
parameters or do not lead to good enough performance. Deep learning methods
proposed to date tend to suffer from poor generalization ability outside the
specific distribution they were trained on, and require learning of many
parameters. They also tend to lead to black-box solutions that are hard to
interpret. In this paper, we suggest combining a recent high-performing
classical method, SPARCOM, with model-based deep learning, using the algorithm
unfolding approach which relies on an iterative algorithm to design a compact
neural network considering domain knowledge. We show that the resulting
network, Learned SPARCOM (LSPARCOM), requires far fewer layers and parameters,
and can be trained on a single field of view. Nonetheless it yields comparable
or superior results to those obtained by SPARCOM with no heuristic parameter
determination or explicit knowledge of the point spread function, and is able
to generalize better than standard deep learning techniques. Our results show
that we can obtain super-resolution imaging from a small number of high emitter
density frames without knowledge of the optical system and across different
test sets. Thus, we believe LSPARCOM will find broad use in single molecule
localization microscopy of biological structures, and pave the way to
interpretable, efficient live-cell imaging in a broad range of settings.

driven by a nonlinear elastic shell and thus is not fixed. Therefore, to
analyze the problem, we map the fluid problem into a fixed domain by applying
an arbitrary Lagrange Euler mapping. Unlike the classical method by which we
consider the problem as its entirety, we utilize the time-discretization and
split the problem into a fluid subproblem and a structure subproblem by an
operator splitting scheme. Since the structure subproblem is nonlinear,
Lax-Milgram lemma does not hold. So we prove the existence and uniqueness by
means of the traditional semigroup theory. Noticing that the Non-Newtonian
fluid possesses a $ p- $Laplacian structure, we show the existence and

the hydromechanical properties of the designated host rock, the
Callovo-Oxfordian claystone (COx), are investigated in laboratory tests.
Experiments presented in this study are carried out to determine several
coefficients required within a transversely isotropic material model. They
include isotropic compression tests, pore pressure tests, and deviatoric
loading tests parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane. We emphasize the
adapted experimental devices and testing procedures, necessary to detect small
strains under high pressures, on a material, which is sensitive to water and
has a very low permeability. The performed experiments provided an
overdetermined set of material parameters at different stress levels. Using all
determined parameters in a least square error regression scheme, seven
independent elastic coefficients and their effective stress dependency were
characterized. In particular, we discovered a significant decrease of elastic
stiffness with decreasing effective stress, which was observed to be
reversible. In both isotropic and deviatoric tests, a notable anisotropic
strain response was found. The Young modulus parallel to bedding was about 1.8
times higher than the one perpendicular to the bedding plane. A notably low
Poisson ratio perpendicular to the bedding plane with values between 0.1 and
0.2 was evidenced. While the anisotropy of the back-calculated Biot coefficient
was found to be low, a significant anisotropy of the Skempton coefficient was
computed.

that, within the context of isolated binary evolution, it is more natural to
assume a priori that the first-born, more massive black hole has a negligible

a task can be profoundly affected by restart: the occasional resetting of the
task's underlying random process. Consequently, determining when restart will
impede or expedite task completion is a subject of major importance. In recent
years researchers explored this subject extensively, with main focus set on
average behavior, i.e. on mean completion times. The mean approach establishes
the centrality of sharp restart: resetting with deterministic (fixed) timers. A
significant drawback of the mean approach is that it provides no insight
regarding tail behavior, i.e. the occurrence likelihood of extreme completion
times. Addressing sharp restart, and shifting the focus from means to extremes,
this paper presents a comprehensive tail-behavior analysis of completion times.
Employing the notion of hazard rates, the analysis yields a set of general
results that determine -- from a tail-behavior perspective -- when sharp
restart will impede or expedite task completion. The results, which are
formulated by explicit hazard-rate criteria, are highly applicable.

scenario of $\Lambda$CDM model, a closed universe is preferred by the Pantheon
sample, which is consistent with that from the Planck CMB spectra. However, the
uncertainty of $\Omega_{k0}$ from the Pantheon SNe sample is about 8 times
larger than that from the Planck data, so the former one supports a closed
universe at a much lower CL than that from the latter one. An open unverse is
supported by the Pantheon sample at $\sim$32\% and $\sim$78\% CLs,
respectively, in the $\omega$CDM and $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM models. Among these

strongly. It shows that $\Omega_{k0}$ is significantly dependent on the adopted

dissipation created by the linear non-self-adjoint operator $y\partial_x
-\nu\partial_{yy}$ in the perturbation equation that makes the nonlinear
stability possible. When the initial perturbation from the Couette flow $(y,
0)$ is no more than the viscosity to a suitable power (in the Sobolev space
$H^b$ with $b>\frac43$), we prove that the solution of the 2D Boussnesq system
with only vertical dissipation on $\mathbb T\times \mathbb R$ remains close to
the Couette at the same order. A special consequence of this result is the
stability of the Couette for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations with only vertical
dissipation.

divided along gender or racial dimensions, generated by the existence of
positive assortative matching among individuals from the same group. If
referrals are important for job search, then expected homophily in the
structure of job contact networks induces different career choices for
individuals from different social groups. This further translates into stable
occupational segregation equilibria in the labor market. We derive conditions
for wage and unemployment inequality in the segregation equilibria and
characterize both the first and the second best social welfare optima. We find
that utilitarian socially optimal policies always involve segregation, but that
integration policies are justifiable by additional distributional concerns. Our
analysis suggests that social interaction through homophilous job referral
networks is an important channel for the propagation and persistence of gender
and racial inequalities in the labour market, complementary to classical
theories such as taste or statistical discrimination.

  expansion and pressurization","  The Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) claystone is considered as a candidate host rock
for a deep geological radioactive waste repository in France. Due to the
exothermic waste packages, the rock is expected to be submitted to temperatures
up to 90{\deg}C. The temperature rise induces deformations of the host rock,
together with an increase in pore pressures, involving complex
thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) couplings. This study aims to better characterize
the THM response of the COx claystone to temperature changes in the laboratory.
To this end, claystone specimens were tested in a temperature controlled, high
pressure isotropic compression cell, under stress conditions close to the
in-situ ones. Thermal loads were applied on the specimens along different
heating and cooling paths. A temperature corrected strain gage system provided
precise measurements of the anisotropic strain response of the specimens.
Drained and undrained thermal expansion coefficients in both transversely
isotropic directions were determined. The measurement of pore pressure changes
in undrained condition yielded the thermal pressurization coefficient. All
parameters were analysed for their compatibility within the thermo-poro-elastic
framework, and their stress and temperature dependency was identified.

  gravity with AdS$_3$ and Minkowski background","  In previous work, black hole vortex solutions in Einstein gravity with
AdS$_3$ background were found where the scalar matter profile had a singularity
at the origin $r=0$. In this paper, we find numerically static vortex solutions
where the scalar and gauge fields have a non-singular profile under Einstein
gravity in an AdS$_3$ background. Vortices with different winding numbers $n$,
VEV $v$ and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ are obtained. These vortices have
positive mass and are not BTZ black holes as they have no event horizon. The
mass is determined in two ways: by subtracting the numerical values of two
separate asymptotic metrics and via an integral that is purely over the matter
fields. The mass of the vortex increases as the cosmological constant becomes
more negative and this coincides with the core of the vortex becoming smaller
(compressed). We then consider the vortex with gravity in asymptotically flat
spacetime for different values of the coupling $\alpha=1/(16 \pi G)$. At the
origin, the spacetime has its highest curvature and there is no singularity. It
transitions to an asymptotic conical spacetime with angular deficit that
increases significantly as $\alpha$ decreases. For comparison, we also consider
the vortex without gravity in flat spacetime. For this case, one cannot obtain
the mass by the first method (subtracting two metrics) but remarkably, via a
limiting procedure, one can obtain an integral mass formula. In the absence of
gauge fields, there is a well-known logarithmic divergence in the energy of the
vortex. With gravity, we present this divergence in a new light. We show that
the metric acquires a logarithmic term which is the $2+1$ dimensional
realization of the Newtonian gravitational potential when General Relativity is
supplemented with a scalar field. This opens up novel possibilities which we
discuss in the conclusion.

MPNet, a novel pre-training method that inherits the advantages of BERT and
XLNet and avoids their limitations. MPNet leverages the dependency among
predicted tokens through permuted language modeling (vs. MLM in BERT), and
takes auxiliary position information as input to make the model see a full
sentence and thus reducing the position discrepancy (vs. PLM in XLNet). We
pre-train MPNet on a large-scale dataset (over 160GB text corpora) and
fine-tune on a variety of down-streaming tasks (GLUE, SQuAD, etc). Experimental
results show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin, and achieves

specific conditional independence assumptions on the underlying predictors. A
variety of methods have been developed in recent years for Bayesian inference
in identifying such network-structured predictors in regression setting, yet
crucial sparsity selection properties for these models have not been thoroughly
investigated. In this paper, we consider a hierarchical model with spike and

equation in $\Omega\setminus\overline D$ with an obstacle $D\Subset\Omega$
whose boundary $\partial D$ is visible from the boundary $\partial\Omega$ of
$\Omega$ and a measurement is given as a set of Cauchy data on
$\partial\Omega$. Here the Cauchy data is given by a unique solution $u$ of the
boundary value problem for the Laplace equation in $\Omega\setminus\overline D$
with homogeneous and inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on $\partial D$
and $\partial\Omega$, respectively. These testing methods are domain sampling
method to estimate the location of the obstacle using test domains and the
associated indicator functions. Also both of these testing methods can test the
analytic extension of $u$ to the exterior of a test domain. Since these methods
are defined via some operators which are dual to each other, we could expect
that there is a duality between the two methods. We will give this duality in
terms of the equivalence of the pre-indicator functions associated to their
indicator functions. As an application of the duality, the reconstruction of
$D$ using the RT gives the reconstruction of $D$ using the NRT and vice versa.
We will also give each of these reconstructions without using the duality if
the Dirichlet data of the Cauchy data on $\partial\Omega$ is not identically
zero and the solution to the associated forward problem does not have any
analytic extension across $\partial D$. Moreover, we will show that these
methods can still give the reconstruction of $D$ if $D$ is a convex polygon and
it satisfies one of the following two properties: all of its corner angles are
irrational and its diameter is less than its distance to $\partial\Omega$.

confinement strategies on a most virulent epidemic. Our approach is motivated
by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two
populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which
the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non
confined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The
model, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following
a specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the
differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is
observed in the COVID-19 epidemic.
  Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our
model. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by
just analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn
out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it
became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of
all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a
rekindling of the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second
epidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the
scenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but typically a
progressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the
progressive exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too
different. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise
exit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major
part of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but
obeying rigorous distancing constraints.

against single-photon loss and boosts the coherence time of the multiphoton
qubit by over a factor of two. Notably, QEC is realized in a modest hardware
setup with neither high-fidelity readout nor fast digital feedback, in contrast
to the technological sophistication required for prior QEC demonstrations.
Compatible with other error suppression and phase stabilization techniques, our
experiment suggests reservoir engineering as a resource-efficient alternative
or supplement to active QEC in future quantum computing architectures.

  Exchange-Correlation Kernel of the Uniform Electron Gas","  According to time-dependent density functional theory, the exact
exchange-correlation kernel f$_{xc}$(n, q, $\omega$) determines not only the
ground-state energy but also the excited-state energies/lifetimes and
time-dependent linear density response of an electron gas of uniform density n
$=$ 3/(4$\pi$r$^3_s$). Here we propose a parametrization of this function based
upon the satisfaction of exact constraints. For the static ($\omega$ = 0)
limit, we modify the model of Constantin and Pitarke at small wavevector q to
recover the known second-order gradient expansion, plus other changes. For all
frequencies $\omega$ at q $=$ 0, we use the model of Gross, Kohn, and Iwamoto.
A Cauchy integral extends this model to complex $\omega$ and implies the
standard Kramers-Kronig relations. A scaling relation permits closed forms for
not only the imaginary but also the real part of f$_{xc}$ for real $\omega$. We
then combine these ingredients by damping out the $\omega$ dependence at large
q in the same way that the q dependence is damped. Away from q $=$ 0 and
$\omega$ $=$ 0, the correlation contribution to the kernel becomes dominant
over exchange, even at r$_s$ $=$ 4, the valence electron density of metallic
sodium. The resulting correlation energy from integration over imaginary
$\omega$ is essentially exact. The plasmon pole of the density response
function is found by analytic continuation of f$_{xc}$ to $\omega$ just below
the real axis, and the resulting plasmon lifetime first decreases from infinity
and then increases as q grows from 0 toward the electron-hole continuum. A
static charge-density wave is found for r$_s$ $>$ 69, and shown to be
associated with softening of the plasmon mode. The exchange-only version of our
static kernel confirms Overhauser's 1968 prediction that correlation enhances
the charge-density wave.

  two-dimensional Artin groups of hyperbolic type","  We study 2-dimensional Artin groups of hyperbolic type from the viewpoint of
measure equivalence, and establish strong rigidity statements.
  We first prove that they are boundary amenable -- as is more generally every
group acting discretely by isometries on a connected piecewise hyperbolic
CAT(-1) simplicial complex with countably many simplices in finitely many
isometry types, under the assumption that vertex stabilizers are boundary
amenable. As a byproduct, these groups satisfy the Novikov conjecture.
  We find an infinite collection $\mathcal{C}$ of Artin groups (already
considered by Crisp in his work on abstract commensurators) which are
superrigid for measure equivalence: every countable group which is measure
equivalent to a group $G$ in the class $\mathcal{C}$, is almost isomorphic to
$G$. We also get measure equivalence classification results within the class of
Artin groups. More precisely, we prove that whenever two 2-dimensional Artin
groups of hyperbolic type are measure equivalent, then there is an isomorphism
between their fixed set graphs -- these graphs were introduced by Crisp and
constitute a natural analogue of the curve graph in the realm of Artin groups.
  This can be reformulated in terms of orbit equivalence rigidity of actions of
2-dimensional Artin groups of hyperbolic type. As many of these groups are
properly proximal in the sense of Boutonnet, Ioana and Peterson, this also
yields strong rigidity results for von Neumann algebras associated to their
ergodic actions. In particular, we build a new infinite class of examples of
groups all of whose ergodic probability measure-preserving actions are
$W^*$-superrigid. Other applications of our work include a superrigidity
statement for cocycles from higher-rank lattices to 2-dimensional Artin groups
of hyperbolic type, and a rigidity statement regarding possible lattice
embeddings of certain Artin groups.

based on the method used by Verschuur (2004) and the automated technique of
Nidever et al. (2008). Both methods use data from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn

reason than the time saved over semi-automated fits. The pitfalls, however, are
often unanticipated, and the most important aspect of any algorithm is the
reproducibility of the results. The comparisons led to the identification of
four problems with the Nidever et al. (2008) analysis: (1) different methods of
calculating the reduced chi-squared measuring the goodness of fit; (2) an
ultra-broad component found bridging the gap between low and intermediate
velocity gas; (3) the lack of an imposed spatial coherence allowing different
components to appear and disappear in profiles separated by a fraction of a
beam width; and (4) multiple, fundamentally different solutions for the
profiles at both the North and South Galactic Poles. A two-step method would
improve the algorithm, where an automated fit is followed by a
quality-assurance, visual inspection. Confirming evidence emerges from this
study of a pervasive component with a line width of order 34 km/s, which may be
explained by the Critical Ionization Velocity (CIV) of helium. Since the
Nidever et al. (2008) paper contains the only result in the refereed literature

this issue, this paper proposes an Align-to-Part Network (APNet) for person

to cover the estimated holistic body regions, from which discriminative part
features can be extracted and aligned. Aligned part features naturally
formulate reID as a partial feature matching procedure, where valid part
features are selected for similarity computation, while part features on
occluded or noisy regions are discarded. This design enhances the robustness of
person search to real-world challenges with marginal computation overhead. This
paper also contributes a Large-Scale dataset for Person Search in the wild

on LSPS. Meanwhile, it achieves competitive performance on existing person

due to hybridization of fermions of different bands with momenta $\text{k}$ and
$\text{k}+\pi$. Such hybridization breaks the conservation of the number of
particles in each band, the Mott transition is a consequence of spontaneous
symmetry breaking. A gap in the spectrum is calculated depending on the
magnitude of on-site Coulomb repulsion and the width of the band for the chain,
as well as for square and cubic lattices. The proposed approach allows us to
describe the formation of the gap in the fermion spectra in the Hubbard and

to a change in the reaction mechanism (rate-determinant step) under visible

Providing an efficient and powerful beamforming design algorithm is a crucial
issue because multicast beamforming problems such as a max-min-fair problem are
NP-hard in general. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have been proposed
for beamforming design. Although these approaches using deep neural networks
exhibit reasonable performance gain compared with conventional
optimization-based algorithms, their scalability is an emerging problem for
large systems in which beamforming design becomes a more demanding task. In
this paper, we propose a novel deep unfolded trainable beamforming design with
high scalability and efficiency. The algorithm is designed by expanding the
recursive structure of an existing algorithm based on projections onto convex
sets and embedding a constant number of trainable parameters to the expanded

results show that the proposed algorithm can accelerate its convergence speed
by using unsupervised learning, which is a challenging training process for

co-directional coupling device, two waveguides are connected by a partially
etched section which facilitates tunable coupling of the adjacent channels.
This evanescent coupling of the two macroscopic wavefunctions in each waveguide
reveals itself in real space oscillations of the condensate. This
Josephson-like oscillation has only been observed in coupled polariton traps so
far. Here, we report on a similar coupling behavior in a controllable,
propagative waveguide-based design. By designing the gap width and channel

polariton device is a passive and scalable coupler element that can serve in
compact, next generation logic architectures.

  MORA project","  In the frame of the project MORA (Matter's Origin from the Radio Activity of
trapped and oriented ions), a transparent axially symmetric radio-frequency ion
trap (MORATrap) was designed in order to measure the triple correlation
parameter $D$ in nuclear $\beta-$decay of laser-polarised ions. The trap design
was inspired from the LPCTrap geometry, operated at GANIL from 2005 to 2013. In
a real (non-ideal) Paul trap, the quadrupole electric potential is not perfect
leading to instabilities in ion motion and therefore affecting the overall
trapping efficiency. This paper presents a numerical method aiming to optimise
the geometry of a trap. It is applied to MORATrap in order to improve the
trapping efficiency and to enlarge the axial transparent solid angle compared
to LPCTrap. In the whole optimisation process, numerical computation of
electric potential and field was carried out using an electrostatic solver
based on boundary element method (BEM). The optimisation consisted in
minimising an objective function (fitness function) depending on higher order
multipoles of the potential. Finally, systematic changes of trap dimensions and
electrode displacements were applied to investigate geometrical effects on the
potential quality.

proposed a conjectural description of these invariants in terms of stable pair

potential host galaxies of active galactic nuclei (AGN). If the local Universe
is a good guide, $\sim$ 50$\%$ of the obscured AGN amongst the SMG population
could be missed even in the deepest X-ray surveys. Radio observations are
insensitive to obscuration; therefore, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
can be used as a tool to identify AGN in obscured systems. A well-established
upper limit to the brightness temperature of 10$^5$ K exists in star-forming
systems, thus VLBI observations can distinguish AGN from star-forming systems
via brightness temperature measurements. We present 1.6 GHz European VLBI
Network (EVN) observations of four SMGs (with measured redshifts) to search for
evidence of compact radio components associated with AGN cores. For two of the
sources, e-MERLIN images are also presented. Out of the four SMGs observed, we
detect one source, J123555.14, that has an integrated EVN flux density of 201
$\pm$ 15.2 $\mu$Jy, corresponding to a brightness temperature of 5.2 $\pm$ 0.7
$\times$ 10$^5$ K. We therefore identify that the radio emission from
J123555.14 is associated with an AGN. We do not detect compact radio emission
from a possible AGN in the remaining sources (J123600.10, J131225.73, and
J163650.43). In the case of J131225.73, this is particularly surprising, and
the data suggest that this may be an extended, jet-dominated AGN that is
resolved by VLBI. Since the morphology of the faint radio source population is
still largely unknown at these scales, it is possible that with a $\sim$ 10 mas
resolution, VLBI misses (or resolves) many radio AGN extended on kiloparsec
scales.

thanks to a spherical full-size polishing tool. To obtain the correct surface'

first introduce active optics and Stress Mirror Polishing techniques, and then,
we describe the process to obtain the appropriate thickness mirror distribution
allowing to generate the required aspheric shape during polishing phase. Shape

using Finite Element Model (FEM) is developed and discussed in order to assist

novel approach to communication description based on the permutations inspired
by the mathematics of a Rubik's cube where the moves form a mathematical

of $P$ processes may be described by a permutation group. This new approach
allows constructing a generalization of the widely used Allreduce algorithms

approach we build an algorithm that successfully solves the well-known problem
of the non-power-of-two number of processes which breaks down the performance
of many existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm provides a general solution
for any number of processes with the dynamically changing amount of

  Transfer Learning","  The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a major outbreak in more than 150 countries
around the world, having a severe impact on the health and life of many people
globally. One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect
the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting
this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the
fastest way to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific
abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19.
Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to
detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare
a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images
exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by board-certified
radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to
train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50,
SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed
chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images,
and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 97\%($\pm$ 5\%),
while having a specificity rate of around 90\%. While the achieved performance
is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19
images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates. Besides
sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC), area under the curve (AUC), and confusion matrix of each
model. The dataset, model implementations (in PyTorch), and evaluations, are
all made publicly available for research community, here:

optimize the design of stratified samples. The optimization is performed by
considering the stratification variables available in the sampling frame, and
the precision constraints on target estimates of the survey (Ballin &
Barcaroli, 2014). The genetic algorithm at the basis of the optimization step
explores the universe of the possible alternative stratifications determining
for each of them the best allocation, that is the one of minumum total size
that allows to satisfy the precision constraints: the final optimal solution is
the one that ensures the global minimum sample size. One fundamental
requirement to make this approach feasible is the possibility to estimate the
variability of target variables in generated strata; in general, as target
variable values are not available in the frame, but only proxy ones,
anticipated variance is calculated by modelling the relations between target
and proxy variables. In case of spatial sampling, it is important to consider
not only the total model variance, but also the co-variance derived by the
spatial auto-correlation. The last release of SamplingStrata enables to
consider both components of variance, thus allowing to harness spatial
auto-correlation in order to obtain more efficient samples.

  time series","  We simulate a simplified version of the price process including bubbles and
crashes proposed in Kreuser and Sornette (2018). The price process is defined
as a geometric random walk combined with jumps modelled by separate, discrete
distributions associated with positive (and negative) bubbles. The key
ingredient of the model is to assume that the sizes of the jumps are
proportional to the bubble size. Thus, the jumps tend to efficiently bring back
excess bubble prices close to a normal or fundamental value (efficient
crashes). This is different from existing processes studied that assume jumps
that are independent of the mispricing. The present model is simplified
compared to Kreuser and Sornette (2018) in that we ignore the possibility of a
change of the probability of a crash as the price accelerates above the normal
price. We study the behaviour of investment strategies that maximize the
expected log of wealth (Kelly criterion) for the risky asset and a risk-free
asset. We show that the method behaves similarly to Kelly on Geometric Brownian
Motion in that it outperforms other methods in the long-term and it beats
classical Kelly. As a primary source of outperformance, we determine knowledge
about the presence of crashes, but interestingly find that knowledge of only
the size, and not the time of occurrence, already provides a significant and
robust edge. We then perform an error analysis to show that the method is
robust with respect to variations in the parameters. The method is most
sensitive to errors in the expected return.

active galactic nucleus (AGN). We detected CO emission representing a rotating
ring-like circumnuclear disk (CND) seen edge-on with the gas mass of $5.3
\times 10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. The CND has smaller gas mass than that in typical
Seyfert galaxies with circumnuclear star formation and is too gas-poor to drive
mass accretion onto the central engine. The continuum emission casts molecular
absorption features of CO, HCN, HCO$^+$, SO, SO$_2$, CS, CN, and H$_2$O, with
H$^{13}$CN and HC$^{15}$N and vibrationally-excited (v$_2 = 1$) HCN and
HCO$^+$. Broader absorption line widths than CND emission line widths imply
presence of a geometrically thick molecular torus with a radius of $2.4 \pm
1.3$ pc and a thickness ratio of $0.7 \pm 0.3$. We estimate the H$_2$ column
density of $(3.3 \pm 0.7) \times 10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ using H$^{12}$CN,
H$^{13}$CN, and HCO$^{+}$ absorption features and adopting abundance ratio of

of $(1.3 \pm 0.3) \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$, which is $\sim 9$\% of the central

covering factor of $0.17^{+0.06}_{-0.03}$. The gas density of clumps inside the
torus is inferred to be $(6.4 \pm 1.3) \times 10^7$ cm$^{-3}$, which meets the

exceeds a flat-rotation curve extrapolated from that of the CND, indicating a
Keplerian rotation inside a 14.4-pc sphere of influence.

\exp(x^\top J x/2)$, whose interaction matrix satisfies $J:= \sum_{i=1}^k
\beta_i J_i$ for some known matrices $J_i$ and some unknown parameters
$\beta_i$, we study whether $J$ can be estimated to high accuracy. Assuming
that each node of the Ising model has bounded total interaction with the other
nodes, i.e. $\|J\|_{\infty} \le O(1)$, we provide a computationally efficient
estimator $\hat{J}$ with the high probability guarantee $\|\hat{J} -J\|_F \le
\widetilde O(\sqrt{k})$, where $\|J\|_F$ can be as high as $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$.
Our guarantee is tight when the interaction strengths are sufficiently low. An
example application of our result is in social networks, wherein nodes make
binary choices, $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, which may be influenced at varying strengths
$\beta_i$ by different networks $J_i$ in which these nodes belong. By observing
a single snapshot of the nodes' behaviors the goal is to learn the combined
correlation structure.
  When $k=1$ and a single parameter is to be inferred, we further show
$|\hat{\beta}_1 - \beta_1| \le \widetilde O(F(\beta_1J_1)^{-1/2})$, where
$F(\beta_1J_1)$ is the log-partition function of the model. This was proved in
prior work under additional assumptions. We generalize these results to any
setting.
  While our guarantees aim both high and low temperature regimes, our proof
relies on sparsifying the correlation network by conditioning on subsets of the
variables, such that the unconditioned variables satisfy Dobrushin's condition,
i.e. a high temperature condition which allows us to apply stronger
concentration inequalities. We use this to prove concentration and
anti-concentration properties of the Ising model, and we believe this
sparsification result has applications beyond the scope of this paper as well.

of discrete aperiodic phase-steps at periodic intervals. We show that the
diffraction of the inscribing laser beam from the phase-step locations of the
CPM produces periodically located half phase-steps along the fiber. The
accumulated phase, along with controlled index modulation, generates the
desired aperiodic reflection spectrum. Compared to a complex 'running-light'
interferometry based inscription method, CPM offers the well known convenience
and reproducibility of the standard phase mask inscription technique. The
complexity of an aperiodic grating is encoded into the structure of the CPM.
Complex filters fabricated with CPM can be used for suppressing the near

the performance of ground based telescopes.

First, the height of the peaks in the time sequence of the number of infection

  relations applied to Biot's poroelasticity model","  Water injection in the aquifer induces deformations in the soil. These
mechanical deformations give rise to a change in porosity and permeability,
which results in non-linearity of the mathematical problem. Assuming that the
deformations are very small, the model provided by Biot's theory of linear
poroelasticity is used to determine the local displacement of the skeleton of a
porous medium, as well as the fluid flow through the pores. In this continuum
scale model, the Kozeny-Carman equation is commonly used to determine the
permeability of the porous medium from the porosity. The Kozeny-Carman relation
states that flow through the pores is possible at a certain location as long as
the porosity is larger than zero at this location in the aquifer. However, from
network models it is known that percolation thresholds exist, indicating that
the permeability will be equal to zero if the porosity becomes smaller than
these thresholds. In this paper, the relationship between permeability and
porosity is investigated. A new permeability-porosity relation, based on the
percolation theory, is derived and compared with the Kozeny-Carman relation.
The strongest feature of the new approach is related to its capability to give
a good description of the permeability in case of low porosities. However, with
this network-inspired approach small values of the permeability are more likely
to occur. Since we show that the solution of Biot's model converges to the
solution of a saddle point problem for small time steps and low permeability,
we need stabilisation in the finite element approximation.

$A_{\mu}$ with broken $U(1)$ gauge symmetry interacts with the four-velocity
$u_c^{\mu}$ of cold dark matter (CDM) through the scalar product $Z=-u_c^{\mu}
A_{\mu}$. This new coupling corresponds to the momentum transfer, so that the
background vector and CDM continuity equations do not have explicit interacting
terms analogous to the energy exchange. Hence the observational preference of
uncoupled generalized Proca theories over the $\Lambda$CDM model can be still
maintained at the background level. Meanwhile, the same coupling strongly
affects the evolution of cosmological perturbations. While the effective sound
speed of CDM vanishes, the propagation speed and no-ghost condition of a
longitudinal scalar of $A_{\mu}$ and the CDM no-ghost condition are subject to
nontrivial modifications by the $Z$ dependence in the Lagrangian. We propose a
concrete dark energy model and show that the gravitational interaction on
scales relevant to the linear growth of large-scale structures can be smaller
than the Newton constant at low redshifts. This leads to the suppression of
growth rates of both CDM and total matter density perturbations, so our model
allows an interesting possibility for reducing the tension of matter density

backgrounds present an anomalous decay rate, which was recently reported. In
this work, we extend the study to other asymptotic geometries, such as,
Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Schwarzschild-AdS black holes. Mainly, we found
that such behaviour is present in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter background, i.e,
the absolute values of the imaginary part of the quasi normal frequencies decay
when the angular harmonic numbers increase if the mass of the scalar field is
smaller than the critical mass, and they grow when the angular harmonic numbers
increase, if the mass of the scalar field is larger than the critical mass.
Also, the value of the critical mass increases when the cosmological constant
increases and also the overtone number is increasing. On the other hand, the
anomalous behaviour is not present in Schwarzschild-AdS black holes
backgrounds.

irreversible ergodic stochastic dynamics with continuous or discrete
state-space. We derive exact results for the mean, fluctuations and
correlations of time average observables from the eigenspectrum of the
underlying generator of Fokker-Planck or master equation dynamics, and discuss
the results from a physical perspective. Feynman-Kac formulas are re-derived

  Learning","  Learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning) is prevalent in
practical applications where only a couple of examples are positively labeled.
Previous PU learning studies typically rely on existing samples such that the
data distribution is not extensively explored. In this work, we propose a
simple yet effective data augmentation method, coined~\algo, based on
\emph{consistency regularization} which provides a new perspective of using PU
data. In particular, the proposed~\algo~incorporates supervised and
unsupervised consistency training to generate augmented data. To facilitate
supervised consistency, reliable negative examples are mined from unlabeled
data due to the absence of negative samples. Unsupervised consistency is
further encouraged between unlabeled datapoints. In addition,~\algo~reduces
margin loss between positive and unlabeled pairs, which explicitly optimizes
AUC and yields faster convergence. Finally, we conduct a series of studies to
demonstrate the effectiveness of consistency regularization. We examined three
kinds of reliable negative mining methods. We show that~\algo~achieves an
averaged improvement of classification error from 16.49 to 13.09 on the
CIFAR-10 dataset across different positive data amount.

  discretisation of the shallow water equations","  Numerical climate- and weather-prediction models require the fast solution of
the equations of fluid dynamics. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretisations
have several advantageous properties. They can be used for arbitrary domains
and support a structured data layout, which is particularly important on modern
chip architectures. For smooth solutions, higher order approximations can be
particularly efficient since errors decrease exponentially in the polynomial
degree. Due to the wide separation of timescales in atmospheric dynamics,
semi-implicit time integrators are highly efficient, since the implicit
treatment of fast waves avoids tight constraints on the time step size, and can
therefore improve overall efficiency. However, if implicit-explicit (IMEX)
integrators are used, a large linear system of equations has to be solved in
every time step. A particular problem for DG discretisations of
velocity-pressure systems is that the normal Schur-complement reduction to an
elliptic system for the pressure is not possible since the numerical fluxes
introduce artificial diffusion terms. For the shallow water equations, which
form an important model system, hybridized DG methods have been shown to
overcome this issue. However, no attention has been paid to the efficient
solution of the resulting linear system of equations. In this paper we show
that the elliptic system for the flux unknowns can be solved efficiently by
using a non-nested multigrid algorithm. The method is implemented in the
Firedrake library and we demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithm
for a representative model problem.

enhancement of both chiral and axial symmetry breaking as the chiral imbalance
of hot QCD matter, regulated by a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$, increases.
The two crossovers are reasonably close to each other in the range of $\mu_5$
examined here and the pseudocritical temperatures rise with $\mu_5$. The
curvatures of the chiral and axial crossovers for the chiral quark chemical
potential approximately coincide and give $\kappa_5 \simeq - 0.011$. We point
out that the presence of $\mu_5$ in thermodynamic equilibrium is inconsistent
with the fact that the chiral charge is not a Noether-conserved quantity for
massive fermions. The chiral chemical potential should not, therefore, be
considered as a true chemical potential that sets a thermodynamically stable
environment in the massive theory, but rather than as a new coupling that may
require a renormalization in the ultraviolet domain. The divergence of an
unrenormalized chiral density, \corr{coming from zero-point fermionic

progress in energy-based model (EBM), in this paper, we propose a novel IL

matching. EBIL combines the idea of both EBM and occupancy measure matching,
which enjoys: (1) high model flexibility for expert policy distribution

the classic Max-Entropy IRL (MaxEnt IRL) approach, and further show that EBIL
can be seen as a simpler and more efficient solution of MaxEnt IRL. Extensive

changes occur in scenarios of infinitely delayed labels, where the true classes

use a k-nearest neighbors strategy to compute the winning neurons in the maps,
adapting to concept drift by online adjusting neuron weight vectors and dataset

the outputs of each neuron, adapting the probabilities and conditional
probabilities of the classes in the stream. Experiments using synthetic and

\textbf{104}, 070402 (2010)] we discuss the physical meaning and the reason why
a large amount of entanglement is needed in order to ensure a bosonic composite
behavior. By applying a composite boson ansatz, we found that a Wigner molecule
confined in two dimensional traps presents a bosonic behavior induced by
symmetry. The two-particle Wigner molecule ground state required by the
composite boson ansatz was obtained within the harmonic approximation in the
strong interacting regime. Our approach allows us to address few-particle
states (widely studied within a variety of theoretical and numerical
techniques) as well as a large number of particles (difficult to address due to
computational costs). For a large number of particles, we found strong
fermionic correlations exposed by the suppression of particle fluctuations. For
a small number of particles, we show that the wave function calculated within
the composite boson ansatz captures the Friedel-Wigner transition. The latter
is shown in a regime in which strong correlations due to the Pauli exclusion
principle arise, therefore, we conclude that the coboson ansatz reproduces the
many particle physics of a confined Wigner molecule, even in the presence of
strong deviations of the ideal bosonic behavior due to fermionic correlations.

clusters over the redshift range $0.02 \leq z \leq 0.72$, which we further
subdivide into four redshift bins. In analysing our stacked samples binned by
redshift, we find evidence for a central excess of UV background light compared
to local backgrounds for clusters with $z<0.3$. We then stacked these $z<0.3$
clusters to find a statistically significant excess of $12 \pm 2.3$ photon

Analysis of possible physical processes contributing to the excess UV

correlations. In that framework, subsystems are viewed as abstract devices that
receive measurement settings as inputs and produce measurement outcomes as
outputs. The labeling convention used to describe these inputs and outputs does
not affect the physics; and relabelings are easily implemented by rewiring the
input and output ports of the devices. However, a more general class of
operations can be achieved by using correlated preprocessing and postprocessing
of the inputs and outputs. In contrast to relabelings, some of these operations
irreversibly lose information about the underlying device. Other operations are
reversible, but modify the number of cardinality of inputs and/or outputs. In
this work, we single out the set of deterministic local maps as the one
satisfying two equivalent constructions: an operational definition from
causality, and an axiomatic definition reminiscent of the definition of quantum
completely positive trace-preserving maps. We then study the algebraic
properties of that set. Surprisingly, the study of these fundamental properties
has deep and practical applications. First, the invariant subspaces of these
transformations directly decompose the space of correlations/Bell inequalities
into nonsignaling, signaling and normalization components. This impacts the
classification of Bell and causal inequalities, and the construction of
assemblages/witnesses in steering scenarios. Second, the left and right
invertible deterministic local operations provide an operational generalization
of the liftings introduced by Pironio [J. Math. Phys., 46(6):062112 (2005)].
Not only Bell-local, but also causal inequalities can be lifted; liftings also

tasks, a growing amount of work is directed towards comparing information
processing in humans and machines. These works have the potential to deepen our
understanding of the inner mechanisms of human perception and to improve
machine learning. Drawing robust conclusions from comparison studies, however,
turns out to be difficult. Here, we highlight common shortcomings that can
easily lead to fragile conclusions. First, if a model does achieve high
performance on a task similar to humans, its decision-making process is not
necessarily human-like. Moreover, further analyses can reveal differences.
Second, the performance of neural networks is sensitive to training procedures
and architectural details. Thus, generalizing conclusions from specific
architectures is difficult. Finally, when comparing humans and machines,
equivalent experimental settings are crucial in order to identify innate
differences. Addressing these shortcomings alters or refines the conclusions of
studies. We show that, despite their ability to solve closed-contour tasks, our
neural networks use different decision-making strategies than humans. We
further show that there is no fundamental difference between same-different and
spatial tasks for common feed-forward neural networks and finally, that neural
networks do experience a ""recognition gap"" on minimal recognizable images. All
in all, care has to be taken to not impose our human systematic bias when
comparing human and machine perception.

application to $n$-type GaAs. Using an abrupt variation of the magnetic field
acting on electron spins, we detect the spin evolution by measuring the Faraday

this allows us to measure either the longitudinal spin relaxation time $T_1$ or
the inhomogeneous transverse spin dephasing time $T_2^*$. In order to determine
the homogeneous spin coherence time $T_2$, we apply a pulse of an oscillating
radiofrequency (rf) field resonant with the Larmor frequency and detect the
subsequent decay of the spin precession. The amplitude of the rf-driven spin
precession is significantly enhanced upon additional optical pumping along the
magnetic field.

handwritten Chinese character recognition (OLHCCR) remains challenging. To
recognize Chinese characters, one popular choice is to adopt the 2D
convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) on the extracted feature images, and
another one is to employ the recurrent neural network (RNN) or 1D-CNN on the
time-series features. Instead of viewing characters as either static images or
temporal trajectories, here we propose to represent characters as geometric
graphs, retaining both spatial structures and temporal orders. Accordingly, we
propose a novel spatial graph convolution network (SGCN) to effectively
classify those character graphs for the first time. Specifically, our SGCN
incorporates the local neighbourhood information via spatial graph convolutions
and further learns the global shape properties with a hierarchical residual
structure. Experiments on IAHCC-UCAS2016, ICDAR-2013, and UNIPEN datasets
demonstrate that the SGCN can achieve comparable recognition performance with
the state-of-the-art methods for character recognition.

providing real-time forecasts of the epidemics pushes fits of dynamical and
statistical models to available data beyond their capabilities. Here we focus
on statistical predictions of COVID-19 infections performed by fitting
asymptotic distributions to actual data. By taking as a case-study the epidemic
evolution of total COVID-19 infections in Chinese provinces and Italian
regions, we find that predictions are characterized by large uncertainties at
the early stages of the epidemic growth. Those uncertainties significantly
reduce after the epidemics peak is reached. Differences in the uncertainty of
the forecasts at a regional level can be used to highlight the delay in the
spread of the virus. Our results warn that long term extrapolation of epidemics
counts must be handled with extreme care as they crucially depend not only on
the quality of data, but also on the stage of the epidemics, due to the
intrinsically non-linear nature of the underlying dynamics. These results
suggest that real-time epidemiological projections should include wide
uncertainty ranges and urge for the needs of compiling high-quality datasets of
infections counts, including asymptomatic patients.

parameters and chemical abundances of 15 elements including helium by either
line equivalent widths or synthetic spectrum analyses. The simultaneous
abundance analysis of MgH and Mg lines adopting theoretical photospheres and a
combination of He/H$-$ratios proved to be the only powerful probe to evaluate
helium abundances of red giants cooler than 4400 K, wherein otherwise helium
line transitions (He {\scs I} 10830 and 5876 \AA) present for a direct spectral
line analysis. The impact of helium-enhanced model photospheres on the
resulting abundance ratios are smaller than 0.15 dex, in agreement with past
studies. The first indirect spectroscopic helium abundances measured in this
paper for the most metal-rich cluster members reveal the discovery of seven
He-enhanced giants ($\Delta$$Y=+$0.15$\pm$0.04), the largest such sample found
spectroscopically to date. The average metallicity of $-$0.79$\pm$0.06 dex and
abundances for O, Na, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Ni, Ba, and La are consistent with values
found for the red giant branch (RGB-a) and subgiant branch (SGB-a) populations
of Omega Centauri, suggesting an evolutionary connection among samples. The
He-enhancement in giants is associated with larger $s$-process elemental
abundances, which correlate with Al and anticorrelate with O. These results
support the formation of He-enhanced, metal-rich population of Omega Centauri
out of the interstellar medium enriched with the ejecta of fast rotating
massive stars, binaries exploding as supernovae and asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars.

can detect information encoded in spatio-temporal multi-valued events. These
are described by the timing of events of interest, e.g., clicks, as well as by
categorical numerical values assigned to each event, e.g., like or dislike.
Other use cases include object recognition from data collected by neuromorphic
cameras, which produce, for each pixel, signed bits at the times of
sufficiently large brightness variations. Existing schemes for training
WTA-SNNs are limited to rate-encoding solutions, and are hence able to detect
only spatial patterns. Developing more general training algorithms for
arbitrary WTA-SNNs inherits the challenges of training (binary) Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs). These amount, most notably, to the non-differentiability of
threshold functions, to the recurrent behavior of spiking neural models, and to
the difficulty of implementing backpropagation in neuromorphic hardware. In
this paper, we develop a variational online local training rule for WTA-SNNs,
referred to as VOWEL, that leverages only local pre- and post-synaptic
information for visible circuits, and an additional common reward signal for
hidden circuits. The method is based on probabilistic generalized linear neural
models, control variates, and variational regularization. Experimental results
on real-world neuromorphic datasets with multi-valued events demonstrate the
advantages of WTA-SNNs over conventional binary SNNs trained with
state-of-the-art methods, especially in the presence of limited computing
resources.

the context of voting theory, and about paradoxes related with such topics. In
the field of reliability theory, the term load-sharing model is commonly used
to designate a special type of multivariate survival models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness that such dependence models can have also in some other fields,
such as those of interest here. Several important, and by now classic, papers
have been devoted to single out and to prove general conclusions in the field
of voting theory. We reformulate and achieve such conclusions by developing a
method of proof, alternative to the existing ones, and completely probabilistic
in nature. As main features of this method, we focus attention on ranking
schemes associated to m-tuples of non-negative random variables and suitably
single out a special subclass of load-sharing models. Then we show that all
possible ranking schemes can be conveniently obtained by only considering such
a special family of survival models. This result leads to some new insight
about the construction of voting situations which give rise to all possible
types of voting paradoxes. Our method and related implications will be also
illustrated by means of some examples and informative remarks.

denoted by $X(n)$, consists of $n$-point subsets of $X$ (i.e., nonempty subsets
of cardinality at most $n$) with the quotient topology induced by the
unordering map $q:X^n\to X(n)$, $(x_1,\cdots,x_n)\mapsto\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$.
That is, a set $A\subset X(n)$ is open if and only if its preimage $q^{-1}(A)$
is open in the product space $X^n$. Given a space $X$, let $H(X)$ denote all
homeomorphisms of $X$. For any class of homeomorphisms $C\subset H(X)$, the
$C$-geometry of $X$ refers to the description of $X$ up to homeomorphisms in
$C$. Therefore, the topology of $X$ is the $H(X)$-geometry of $X$. By a ($C$-)
geometric property of $X$ we will mean a property of $X$ that is preserved by
homeomorphisms of $X$ (in $C$). Metric geometry of a space $X$ refers to the
study of geometry of $X$ in terms of notions of metrics (e.g., distance, or
length of a path, between points) on $X$. In such a study, we call a space $X$
metrizable if $X$ is homeomorphic to a metric space. Naturally, $X(n)$ always
inherits some aspect of every geometric property of $X$ or $X^n$. Thus, the
geometry of $X(n)$ is in general richer than that of $X$ or $X^n$. For example,
it is known that if $X$ is an orientable manifold, then (unlike $X^n$) $X(n)$
for $n>1$ can be an orientable manifold, a non-orientable manifold, or a
non-manifold. In studying geometry of $X(n)$, a central research question is
""If $X$ has geometric property $P$, does it follow that $X(n)$ also has
property $P$?"". A related question is ""If $X$ and $Y$ have a geometric relation
$R$, does it follow that $X(n)$ and $Y(n)$ also have the relation $R$?"".

to introduce at least two nucleon resonances in the $s$ channel in constructing
the reaction amplitudes to describe the cross-section data. One of the needed
resonances is $N(2060)5/2^-$, and the other one could be one of the

the data on spin density matrix elements for $K^*$ meson reported recently by
the CLAS Collaboration, with the purpose being to impose further constraints on

elements taken into account, only the set with the $N(2060)5/2^-$ and
$N(2000)5/2^+$ resonances among those five possible solutions extracted from
the analysis of the differential cross-section data can satisfactorily describe
the data on both the differential cross sections and the spin density matrix

product relevance but also their personal preferences. Despite its great
potential, recent analysis on commercial logs shows that personalization does
not always improve the quality of product search. Most existing personalized
product retrieval models, however, cannot control whether to apply
personalization or not under different contexts. From the perspective of model
design, the typical paradigm of existing models is to represent and match user
intents and items in the semantic space, where finer-grained matching is
totally discarded and the ranking of an item cannot be explained further than
just user/item level similarity. In addition, while some models in existing
studies have created dynamic user representations based on search context,
their representations for items are static across all search sessions. This
makes every piece of information about the item always have equal importance in
representing the item during matching with various user intents. Given the
above limitations,we propose a review-based transformer model (RTM) for
personalized product search, which encodes the sequence of query, user reviews,
and item reviews with a transformer architecture. RTM can perform adaptive
personalization with different accumulative attention weights on user reviews
in various search sessions. Moreover, review-level matching is conducted
between the user and item, where each reviewhas a dynamic effect according to
the context in the sequence. This makes it possible to identify useful reviews
to explain the scoring. Experimental results show that RTM achieves
significantly better performance than state-of-the-art personalized product
search baselines.

  We prove that for every fixed pattern graph $H$ without loops, \textsc{Max

  hierarchical Bayesian control systems perspective","  In this paper, we aim to integrate findings from the fields of machine
learning and network science to argue that organisms can be modeled as
hierarchical Bayesian control systems with small world and bottleneck (bow tie)
network structure. The nested hierarchical organization of such networks allows
organisms to form increasingly integrated percepts and concepts of their inner
and outer context, which can be compared to increasingly encompassing
predictive models of the world (goal states), to allow for an optimal control
of actions. We argue that hierarchical Bayesian inference produces a hierarchy
of goal states, from which it follows that organisms must have some form of
`highest goals'. For all organisms, these predictive models involve interior
(self) models, exterior (social) models and overarching (normative) models. We
show how such goals are constructed from progressively lesser goal states and
that goal hierarchies tend to decompose in a top-down manner under severe and
prolonged levels of stress. This loss of high-level control leads to a
disinhibition of subordinate hierarchical levels, producing `critical' behavior
and tipping points (a sudden loss of homeostasis). Such phase transitions
amount either to disease or the death of the organism. This model can be used
to model organisms of any type, including humans. In humans, learning
higher-level world models corresponds to personality development. A top-down
collapse of high-level integrative goal states under stress is identified as a
common factor in all forms of mental disease (psychopathology). The paper
concludes by discussing ways of testing these hypotheses empirically.

however, the volume available for the instrumentation is limited, and footprint

prior studies because their atomization energies are known from experiment.
Basis sets from cc-pVDZ to cc-pV5Z are used, totaling up to 500 orbitals and a
Hilbert space of $10^{32}$ Slater determinants for the largest molecules. For
each basis, an extrapolated energy within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol or 1.6
mHa/mol) of the exact energy for that basis is computed using only a tiny
fraction of the entire Hilbert space. We also use our almost exact energies to
benchmark coupled cluster theory (CCSD(T)) energies. The energies are
extrapolated to the basis set limit and compared to the experimental
atomization energies. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) from experiment is 0.71

  tidal stream","  AT2016dah and AT2017fyp are fairly typical Andromeda Galaxy (M31) classical
novae. AT2016dah is an almost text book example of a 'very fast' declining, yet
uncommon, Fe II'b' (broad-lined) nova, discovered during the rise to peak
optical luminosity, and decaying with a smooth broken power-law light curve.
AT2017fyp is classed as a 'fast' nova, unusually for M31, its early decline
spectrum simultaneously shows properties of both Fe II and He/N spectral types
- a 'hybrid'. Similarly, the light curve of AT2017fyp has a broken power-law
decline but exhibits an extended flat-topped maximum. Both novae were followed
in the UV and X-ray by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, but no X-ray source
was detected for either nova. The pair were followed photometrically and
spectroscopically into their nebular phases. The progenitor systems were not
visible in archival optical data, implying that the mass donors are main
sequence stars. What makes AT2016dah and AT2017fyp particularly interesting is
their position with respect to M31. The pair are close on the sky but are
located far from the centre of M31, lying almost along the semi-minor axis of
their host. Radial velocity measurements and simulations of the M31 nova
population leads to the conclusion that both novae are members of the Andromeda
Giant Stellar Stream (GSS). We find the probability of at least two M31 novae
appearing coincident with the GSS by chance is ~1%. Therefore, we claim that
these novae arose from the GSS progenitor, not M31 - the first confirmed novae
discovered in a tidal steam.

largely reduced when, rather than the half-mass radius Re, the size at a fixed
surface density is used. Here we address why this happens. We show how a
reduction is to be expected because any two galaxies with the same Mstar have
at least one radius with identical surface density, where the galaxies have
identical size. However, the reason why the scatter is reduced to the observed
level is not trivial, and we pin it down to the galaxy surface density profiles
approximately following Sersic profiles with their Re and Sersic index (n)
anti-correlated (i.e., given Mstar, n increases when Re decreases). Our
analytical results describe very well the behavior of the observed galaxies as
portrayed in the NASA Sloan Atlas (NSA), which contains more than half a
million local objects with 7 < log(Mstar/Msun) < 11.5. The comparison with NSA
galaxies also allows us to find the optimal values for the mass surface density
(2.4m0.9p1.3 Msun/pc2) and surface brightness (r-band 24.7pm0.5 mag/arcsec2)
that minimize the scatter, although the actual values depend somehow on the
subset of NSA galaxies used for optimization. The physical reason for the
existence of optimal values is unknown but, as Trujillo+20 point out, they are
close to the gas surface density threshold to form stars and thus may trace the
physical end of a galaxy. Our NSA-based size--mass relation agrees with theirs
on the slope as well as on the magnitude of the scatter. As a by-product of the
narrowness of the size--mass relation (only 0.06 dex), we propose to use the
size of a galaxy to measure its stellar mass. In terms of observing time, it is
not more demanding than the usual photometric techniques and may present
practical advantages in particular cases.

the theoretical asymptotic unbiasedness of the gradient estimator is

numerical-relativity (NR) simulations, and waveforms from perturbation theory.
We validate SEOBNRv4PHM by comparing it to the public catalog of 1405
precessing NR waveforms of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS)
collaboration, and also to new 118 precessing NR waveforms, which span mass
ratios 1-4 and spins up to 0.9. We stress that SEOBNRv4PHM is not calibrated to
NR simulations in the precessing sector. We compute the unfaithfulness against
the 1523 SXS precessing NR waveforms, and find that, for $94\%$ ($57\%$) of the
cases, the maximum value, in the total mass range $20-200 M_\odot$, is below
$3\%$ ($1\%$). Those numbers become $83\%$ ($20\%$) when using the IMR,
multipolar, precessing phenomenological model IMRPhenomPv3HM. We investigate
the impact of such unfaithfulness values with two parameter-estimation studies
on synthetic signals. We also compute the unfaithfulness between those waveform
models and identify in which part of the parameter space they differ the most.
We validate them also against the multipolar, precessing NR surrogate model
NRSur7dq4, and find that the SEOBNRv4PHM model outperforms IMRPhenomPv3HM.

  Fiber Segmentation in Corneal Confocal Microscopic Images using Inaccurate
  Annotations","  Semantic image segmentation is one of the most important tasks in medical
image analysis. Most state-of-the-art deep learning methods require a large
number of accurately annotated examples for model training. However, accurate
annotation is difficult to obtain especially in medical applications. In this
paper, we propose a spatially constrained deep convolutional neural network
(DCNN) to achieve smooth and robust image segmentation using inaccurately
annotated labels for training. In our proposed method, image segmentation is
formulated as a graph optimization problem that is solved by a DCNN model
learning process. The cost function to be optimized consists of a unary term
that is calculated by cross entropy measurement and a pairwise term that is
based on enforcing a local label consistency. The proposed method has been
evaluated based on corneal confocal microscopic (CCM) images for nerve fiber
segmentation, where accurate annotations are extremely difficult to be
obtained. Based on both the quantitative result of a synthetic dataset and
qualitative assessment of a real dataset, the proposed method has achieved
superior performance in producing high quality segmentation results even with
inaccurate labels for training.

fine structure of quantum dot states could be tuned using hybrid
semiconductor-piezoelectric devices. Here, we show how an applied external
stress can directly impact the polarization properties of coupled InAs quantum
dot-micropillar cavity systems. In our experiment, we find that we can
reversibly tune the anisotropic polarization splitting of the fundamental
microcavity mode by approximately 60 $\mu\text{eV}$. We discuss the origin of
this tuning mechanism, which arises from an interplay between elastic
deformation and the photoelastic effect in our micropillar. Finally, we exploit
this effect to tune the quantum dot polarization opto-mechanically via the
polarization-anisotropic Purcell effect. Our work paves the way for
optomechanical and reversible tuning of the polarization and spin properties of
light-matter coupled solid state systems.

along the product life cycle has become an increasingly important
access-to-market requirement. However, these security standards rely on
mandatory immunity assumptions such as the integrity and authenticity of an
initial system configuration typically loaded from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM).
This applies especially to FPGA-based Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC)
architectures, since object codes as well as configuration data easily exceed
the capacity of a secure bootROM. In this context, an attacker could try to
alter the content of the NVM device in order to manipulate the system. The PSoC
therefore relies on the integrity of the NVM particularly at boot-time. In this
paper, we propose a methodology for securely booting from an NVM in a
potentially unsecure environment by exploiting the reconfigurable logic of the
FPGA. Here, the FPGA serves as a secure anchor point by performing required
integrity and authenticity verifications prior to the configuration and
execution of any user application loaded from the NVM on the PSoC. The proposed
secure boot process is based on the following assumptions and steps: 1) The
boot configurationis stored on a fully encrypted Secure Digital memory card (SD
card) or alternatively Flash acting as NVM. 2) At boot time, a hardware design
called Trusted Memory-Interface Unit (TMIU) is loaded to verify first the
authenticity of the deployed NVM and then after decryption the integrity of its
content. To demonstrate the practicability of our approach, we integrated the
methodology into the vendor-specific secure boot process of a Xilinx Zynq PSoC
and evaluated the design objectives performance, power and resource costs.

tradeoffs between the running time of learning process and the number of rounds

give optimal time-round tradeoffs, as well as demonstrate complexity
separations between top-$1$ arm identification and top-$m$ arm identifications

autoregressive (VAR) process is stationary if and only if the roots of its
characteristic equation lie outside the unit circle, constraining the
autoregressive coefficient matrices to lie in the stationary region. However,
the stationary region has a highly complex geometry which impedes specification
of a prior distribution. In this work, an unconstrained reparameterisation of a
stationary VAR model is presented. The new parameters are based on partial
autocorrelation matrices, which are interpretable, and can be transformed
bijectively to the space of unconstrained square matrices. This transformation
preserves various structural forms of the partial autocorrelation matrices and
readily facilitates specification of a prior. Properties of this prior are
described along with an important special case which is exchangeable with
respect to the order of the elements in the observation vector. Posterior
inference and computation are described and implemented using Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo via Stan. The prior and inferential procedures are illustrated with an
application to a macroeconomic time series which highlights the benefits of
enforcing stationarity.

settings where treatment is determined by whether an observed running variable
crosses a pre-specified threshold. While the resulting sampling design is
sometimes described as akin to locally randomized experiment in a neighborhood
of the threshold, standard formal analyses do not make reference to
probabilistic treatment assignment and instead identify treatment effects via
continuity arguments. Here we propose a new approach to identification,
estimation, and inference in regression discontinuity designs that exploits
measurement error in the running variable for identification. Under an
assumption that the measurement error is exogenous, we show how to consistently
estimate causal effects using a class linear estimators that weight treated and
control units so as to balance a latent variable of which the running variable
is a noisy measure. We find this approach to facilitate identification of both
familiar estimands from the literature, as well as policy-relevant estimands
that correspond to the effects of realistic changes to the existing treatment
assignment rule. Regression discontinuity designs with estimable measurement
error arise in many settings, including medicine, education, and meta-science.
We demonstrate the method with a study of retention of HIV patients.

perform a global fit to all the relevant and up-to-date $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$

couples predominantly to second and third-generation SM fermions. We then look

  learned by deep models: with an application to image classification tasks","  Causal modeling has been recognized as a potential solution to many
challenging problems in machine learning (ML). While counterfactual thinking
has been leveraged in ML tasks that aim to predict the consequences of
actions/interventions, it has not yet been applied to more traditional/static
supervised learning tasks, such as the prediction of labels in image
classification tasks. Here, we propose a counterfactual approach to
remove/reduce the influence of confounders from the predictions generated a
deep neural network (DNN). The idea is to remove confounding from the feature
representations learned by DNNs in anticausal prediction tasks. By training an
accurate DNN using softmax activation at the classification layer, and then
adopting the representation learned by the last layer prior to the output layer
as our features, we have that, by construction, the learned features will fit
well a (multi-class) logistic regression model, and will be linearly associated
with the labels. Then, in order to generate classifiers that are free from the
influence of the observed confounders we: (i) use linear models to regress each
learned feature on the labels and on the confounders and estimate the
respective regression coefficients and model residuals; (ii) generate new
counterfactual features by adding back to the estimated residuals to a linear
predictor which no longer includes the confounder variables; and (iii) train
and evaluate a logistic classifier using the counterfactual features as inputs.
We validate the proposed methodology using colored versions of the MNIST and
fashion-MNIST datasets, and show how the approach can effectively combat
confounding and improve generalization in the context of dataset shift.
Finally, we also describe how to use conditional independence tests to evaluate
if the counterfactual approach has effectively removed the confounder signals
from the predictions.

transport properties of non-equilibrium quasiparticles (QPs) in superconductor

interplays with magnon spin currents remains elusive. Here, using non-local
magnon spin-transport devices where a singlet SC (Nb) on top of a ferrimagnetic

conversion efficiency of magnon spin to QP charge via inverse spin-Hall effect
(iSHE) in such an exchange-spin-split SC can be greatly enhanced by up to 3
orders of magnitude compared with that in the normal state, particularly when
its interface superconducting gap matches the magnon spin accumulation. Through
systematic measurements with varying the current density and SC thickness, we
identify that superconducting coherence peaks and exchange spin-splitting of
the QP density-of-states, yielding a larger spin excitation while retaining a
modest QP charge-imbalance relaxation, are responsible for the giant QP iSHE.

aid of a so-called Quadrupole Resonator (QPR). This procedure is affected by
certain systematic measurement errors with various sources of uncertainties. In
this paper, to reduce the impact of geometrical uncertainties on the
measurement bias, the modified steepest descent method is used for the
multi-objective shape optimization of a QPR {in terms of an expectation
measure}. Thereby, variations of geometrical parameters are modeled by the
Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion technique. Then, the resulting Maxwell's
eigenvalue problem with random input data is solved using the PC-based
stochastic collocation method (PC-SCM). Furthermore, to assess the contribution
of the particular geometrical parameters, the variance-based sensitivity
analysis is proposed. This allows for modifying the steepest descent algorithm,
which results in reducing the computational load needed to find optimal
solutions. Finally, optimization results in the form of an efficient
approximation of the Pareto front for a three dimensional (3D) model of the QPR
are shown.

  purely non-pharmaceutical interventions","  When effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available,
non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, home quarantine and
far-reaching shutdown of public life are the only available strategies to
prevent the spreading of epidemics. Based on an extended SEIR model and
continuous-time optimal control theory, in this paper the optimal
non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy is presented for the case that a
vaccine is never found. In this case, the optimal control must meet two
competing requirements: First, the minimization of disease-related deaths, and,
second, the establishment of a sufficient degree of herd immunity at the end of
the measures, in order to exclude a second wave. The presented control strategy
is a single-intervention scenario that goes beyond heuristically motivated
interventions and simple ""flattening of the curve"". The characteristic time
course of the computed optimal control is the following: After an intense but
short initial lockdown, a dynamical equilibrium is enforced during which the
number of actively infected is held on a constant level for a longer period of
time. At the same time, the measures can be gradually relaxed with an ever
increasing speed. Two simple rules for the optimal control of the effective
reproduction number are presented, see Eqs. (13)-(14), which ensure a stable
route out of the initial lockdown. The rules are directly applicable in
practice, as they only depend on a precise knowledge of the cumulative number
of cases and a reliable estimate of the effective reproduction number. The
obtained results could serve as a guideline for the implementation and gradual
relaxation of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures also in other scenarios,
e.g., when the development of a vaccine is expected soon. The model system is
calibrated to reproduce the initial exponential growth phase of the COVID-19
epidemic in Germany.

generalization ability to unseen problems and is also able to achieve more than

characterize subgroups of the product stabilizer group on a block of logical
qubits corresponding to dual codes of classical error correcting codes. We
prove conditions on the set of correctable error patterns allowing for
unambiguous decoding based on a lookup table and present a proof of concept in
the low noise regime. Assuming an independent Pauli error model with error rate
$10^{-7}$ and perfect two-qubit gates and measurements, a 3-error correcting
classical code can protect $L =127$ logical qubits encoded with a [[ 17, 1, 5
]] topological color code with just 338 extra qubits for syndrome extraction.
The associated probability of failure is ${\cal O}(10^{-14})$, making the
construction viable for deep circuits. For a large class of algebraic codes, we
show that qubit overhead scales as ${\cal O}(\log_2(L+1))$ asymptotically. The
basic construction is adapted to account for two-qubit and measurement errors,
while still employing a lookup table based decoder. We argue that quantum error
correction is more aptly viewed as source compression in the sense of Shannon
and that Shannon's source and channel coding theorems provide bounds on the
overhead rates of quantum post-selection tasks, such as quantum error
correction, at the level of the encoded quantum register

charged particle entering into 4-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet-Maxwell black holes,
we calculate the black hole thermodynamic properties by using the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In the normal phase space, the cosmological constant
and Gauss-Bonnet parameter in Gauss-Bonnet gravity are fixed, the black hole
satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics and the weak cosmic
censorship conjecture (WCCC) is valid. On the other hand, in the case of
extended phase space, the cosmological constant and Gauss-Bonnet parameter in
Gauss-Bonnet gravity are treated as thermodynamic variables. The black hole
also satisfies the first law of thermodynamics. However, the increase or
decrease of entropy of the black hole depends on some specific conditions.
Furthermore, we find that the WCCC is violated for the near-extremal black
holes in the extended phase space.

randomized messages to a secure shuffler, the shuffler permutes the messages,

of data while maintaining an internal state that is differentially private with
regard to the stream data. We give evidence connecting these two apparently
different models.
  Our results focus on robustly shuffle private protocols whose privacy
guarantees are not greatly affected by malicious users. First, we give robustly
shuffle private protocols and upper bounds for counting distinct elements and
uniformity testing. Second, we use pan-private lower bounds to prove robustly
shuffle private lower bounds for both problems. Focusing on the dependence on
the domain size $k$, we find that both robust shuffle privacy and pan-privacy
have additive accuracy $\Theta(\sqrt{k})$ for counting distinct elements and
sample complexity $\tilde \Theta(k^{2/3})$ for uniformity testing. Both results
polynomially separate central privacy and robust shuffle privacy. Finally, we
show that this connection is useful in both directions: we give a pan-private
adaptation of recent work on shuffle private histograms and use it to recover
further separations between pan-privacy and interactive local privacy.

they record the history of events such as mergers, gas inflow and
star-formation. However, the accuracy with which gradients can be measured is
limited by spatial resolution and noise, and hence measurements need to be
corrected for such effects. We use high resolution (~20 pc) simulation of a
face-on Milky Way mass galaxy, coupled with photoionisation models, to produce
a suite of synthetic high resolution integral field spectroscopy (IFS)
datacubes. We then degrade the datacubes, with a range of realistic models for
spatial resolution (2 to 16 beams per galaxy scale length) and noise, to
investigate and quantify how well the input metallicity gradient can be
recovered as a function of resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with the
intention to compare with modern IFS surveys like MaNGA and SAMI. Given
appropriate propagation of uncertainties and pruning of low SNR pixels, we show
that a resolution of 3-4 telescope beams per galaxy scale length is sufficient
to recover the gradient to ~10-20% uncertainty. The uncertainty escalates to
~60% for lower resolution. Inclusion of the low SNR pixels causes the
uncertainty in the inferred gradient to deteriorate. Our results can
potentially inform future IFS surveys regarding the resolution and SNR required
to achieve a desired accuracy in metallicity gradient measurements.

solved through supervised learning, the degradation in real photos is complex
and the domain gap between synthetic images and real old photos makes the
network fail to generalize. Therefore, we propose a novel triplet domain
translation network by leveraging real photos along with massive synthetic
image pairs. Specifically, we train two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to
respectively transform old photos and clean photos into two latent spaces. And
the translation between these two latent spaces is learned with synthetic
paired data. This translation generalizes well to real photos because the
domain gap is closed in the compact latent space. Besides, to address multiple
degradations mixed in one old photo, we design a global branch with a partial
nonlocal block targeting to the structured defects, such as scratches and dust
spots, and a local branch targeting to the unstructured defects, such as noises
and blurriness. Two branches are fused in the latent space, leading to improved
capability to restore old photos from multiple defects. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality for old photos
restoration.

determined from Type Ia supernovae. The Planck best fit model also predicts
higher values of the matter density fraction $\Omega_m$ and clustering
amplitude $S_8$ compared to those obtained from the Dark Energy Survey Year 1

additional small-scale inhomogeneities in the baryon density may solve both the
$H_0$ and the $S_8-\Omega_m$ tensions. The additional baryon inhomogeneities
can be induced by primordial magnetic fields present in the plasma prior to
recombination. The required field strength to solve the Hubble tension is just
what is needed to explain the existence of galactic, cluster, and extragalactic
magnetic fields without relying on dynamo amplification. Our results show clear
evidence for this effect and motivate further detailed studies of primordial
magnetic fields, setting several well-defined targets for future observations.

increased to $10^8 \, {\rm GeV}$ for doublet breaking of $SU(2)_R$, and further
to $10^9 \, {\rm GeV}$ if leptogenesis occurs via $N_2$ decay, while the upper

simplification can be explained by considering the gap closures in the
quasienergy dispersion. These gap closures are pinned to high-symmetry points,
where all the effective Floquet Hamiltonians collapse to the same form. While
for all protocols all topological phase transitions coincide, the gap size and
the number of edge modes in the quasienergy spectra vary considerably depending
on the chosen driving pattern. This gives rise to a full range of edge states
with different degrees of localization, from highly localized to completely
delocalized. Switching between different driving protocols then suggests a
dynamical control of the localization and stability of topological edge modes,
with possible applications in quantum computation.

structure constants of the extended operator algebra consist of one-point
functions of local operators which are nonvanishing due to the defect insertion
and carry nontrivial coupling dependence. We study an important class of
half-BPS superconformal defects engineered by D5 branes that share three common
directions with the D3 branes and involve Nahm pole configurations for the SYM

non-perturbative results in the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ for the defect
one-point functions of both BPS and non-BPS operators, building upon recent
progress in localization and integrability methods. For BPS operator insertions
in the SYM with D5-brane type boundary or interface, we derive an effective two
dimensional defect-Yang-Mills (dYM) theory from supersymmetric localization,
which gives an efficient way to extract defect observables and generates a
novel matrix model for the defect one-point function. By solving the matrix
model in the large $N$ limit, we obtain exact results in $\lambda$ which
interpolate between perturbative Feynman diagram contributions in the weak
coupling limit and IIB string theory predictions on $AdS_5\times S^5$ in the
strong coupling regime, providing a precision test of AdS/CFT with interface
defects. For general non-BPS operators, we develop a non-perturbative
bootstrap-type program for integrable boundary states on the worldsheet of the
IIB string theory, corresponding to the interface defects in the planar SYM.
Such integrable boundary states are constrained by a set of general consistency
conditions for which we present explicit solutions that reproduce and extend
the known results at weak coupling from integrable spin-chain methods.

$k=1h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Our key ansatz is that the number density of halos
depends on the non-linear density contrast filtered on some unknown scale $R$.
Using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure to evaluate the
two-halo term, we obtain a model for the power spectrum with only two fitting
parameters: $R$ and the effective `sound speed', which encapsulates small-scale
physics. This is tested with two suites of cosmological simulations across a
broad range of cosmologies and found to be highly accurate. Due to its physical
motivation, the statistics can be easily extended beyond the power spectrum; we
additionally derive the one-loop covariance matrices of cluster counts and
their combination with the matter power spectrum. This yields a significantly
better fit to simulations than previous models, and includes a new model for
super-sample effects, which is rigorously tested with separate universe
simulations. At low redshift, we find a significant ($\sim 10\%$) exclusion
covariance from accounting for the finite size of halos which has not
previously been modeled. Such power spectrum and covariance models will enable
joint analysis of upcoming large-scale structure surveys, gravitational lensing
surveys and cosmic microwave background maps on scales down to the non-linear

requires an accurate determination of the total reservoir of molecular gas
mass. However, despite being the most abundant molecule in the Universe, H$_2$
is challenging to detect through direct observations and indirect methods have
to be used to estimate the total molecular gas reservoir. These are often based
on scaling relations from tracers such as CO or dust, and are generally
calibrated in the Milky Way. Yet, evidence that these scaling relations are
environmentally dependent is growing. In particular, the commonly used
CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor (X$_{\rm CO}$) is expected to be higher in
metal-poor and/or strongly UV-irradiated environments. We use new SOFIA/FIFI-LS
observations of far-infrared fine structure lines from the ionised and neutral
gas and the Meudon photodissociation region model to constrain the physical
properties and the structure of the gas in the massive star-forming region of
30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and determine the spatially resolved
distribution of the total reservoir of molecular gas in the proximity of the
young massive cluster R136. We compare this value with the molecular gas mass
inferred from ground-based CO observations and dust-based estimates to quantify
the impact of this extreme environment on commonly used tracers of the
molecular gas. We find that the strong radiation field combined with the
half-solar metallicity of the surrounding gas are responsible for a large
reservoir of ""CO-dark"" molecular gas, leaving a large fraction of the total
H$_2$ gas (> 75%) undetected when adopting a standard X$_{\rm CO}$ factor in
this massive star-forming region.

  at z=3","  The standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) predicts the existence of the
cosmic web: a distribution of matter into sheets and filaments connecting
massive halos. However, observational evidence has been elusive due to the low
surface brightness of the filaments. Recent deep MUSE/VLT data and upcoming
observations offer a promising avenue for Ly$\alpha$ detection, motivating the
development of modern theoretical predictions. We use hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations run with the AREPO code to investigate the potential
detectability of large-scale filaments, excluding contributions from the halos
embedded in them. We focus on filaments connecting massive
($M_{200c}\sim(1-3)\times10^{12} M_\odot$) halos at z=3, and compare different
simulation resolutions, feedback levels, and mock-image pixel sizes. We find
increasing simulation resolution does not substantially improve detectability
notwithstanding the intrinsic enhancement of internal filament structure. By
contrast, for a MUSE integration of 31 hours, including feedback increases the
detectable area by a factor of $\simeq$5.5 on average compared with simulations
without feedback, implying that even the non-bound components of the filaments
have substantial sensitivity to feedback. Degrading the image resolution from
the native MUSE scale of (0.2"")$^2$ per pixel to (5.3"")$^2$ apertures has the
strongest effect, increasing the detectable area by a median factor of
$\simeq$200 and is most effective when the size of the pixel roughly matches
the width of the filament. Finally, we find the majority of Ly$\alpha$ emission
is due to electron impact collisional excitations, as opposed to radiative
recombination.

SBOs appear as minute to hour-long extragalactic X-ray transients. They are
challenging to detect and only one SBO has been observed to date. Here, we
search the XMM-Newton archive and find twelve new SN SBO candidates. We
identify host galaxies to nine of these at estimated redshifts of 0.1-1. The
SBO candidates have energies of ${\sim}10^{46}$ erg, timescales of 30-3000 s,
and temperatures of 0.1-1 keV. They are all consistent with being SN SBOs, but
some may be misidentified Galactic foreground sources or other extragalactic
objects. SBOs from blue supergiants agree well with most of the candidates.
However, a few could be SBOs from Wolf-Rayet stars surrounded by dense
circumstellar media, whereas two are more naturally explained as SBOs from red
supergiants. The observations tentatively support asymmetric SBOs, in agreement
with recent three-dimensional SN explosion simulations. eROSITA may detect
${\sim}$2 SBOs per year, which could be detected in live analyses and promptly

accurately we can infer the astrophysical parameters of black hole mergers in
the absence of noise. We do this by computing the overlap between waveforms in
the testing data set and the corresponding signals whose mass-ratio and
individual spins are predicted by our neural network. We find that the
convergence of high performance computing and physics-inspired optimization
algorithms enable an accurate reconstruction of the mass-ratio and individual

different stellar metallicities (Z=0.02, 0.002 and 0.0002) and two initial
density regimes (density at the half-mass radius $\rho_{\rm
h}\ge{}3.4\times10^4$ and $\ge{1.5\times10^2}$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$ in dense and

BHs with mass $m_{\rm BH}>60$ M$_\odot$ at Z=0.0002, 0.002 and 0.02,

up to $\sim{}320$ M$_\odot$. BBH mergers born via dynamical exchanges
(exchanged BBHs) can be more massive than BBH mergers formed from binary

primary mass $\sim{}88$ M$_\odot$, inside the pair-instability mass gap, and a

a local BBH merger rate density $\sim{}110$ and $\sim{}55$ Gpc$^{-3}$

width of the inclusive non-leptonic decay of a $B$ meson ($B^+$, $B_d$ or
$B_s$), stemming from the quark flavour-changing transition $b \to q_1 \bar q_2
q_3$, where $q_1,q_2 = u, c$ and $q_3 = d, s$. The key ideas of the computation
are the local expansion of the quark propagator in the external gluon field
including terms with covariant derivative of the gluon field strength tensor
and the standard technique of the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE). We confirm the
previously known expressions of the $1/m_b^3$ contributions to the
semi-leptonic decay $b \to q_1 \ell \bar \nu_\ell$, with $\ell = e, \mu, \tau$
and of the $1/m_b^2$ contributions to the non-leptonic modes. We find that this
new term can give a sizeable correction of about $- 4 \, \%$ to the
non-leptonic decay width of a $B$ meson. For $B_d$ and $B_s$ mesons this turns
out to be the dominant correction to the free b-quark decay, while for the
$B^+$ meson the Darwin term gives the second most important correction -
roughly 1/2 to 1/3 of the phase space enhanced Pauli interference contribution.
Due to the tiny experimental uncertainties in lifetime measurements the
incorporation of the Darwin term contribution is crucial for precision tests of
the Standard Model.

unconstrained, and this introduces large uncertainties, particularly in the
dust mass determinations. Using an analytical and physically-motivated model,
we show that dust in high-$z$, star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMC),
largely dominating the observed far-infrared luminosity, is warmer ($T_d > 60\
\mathrm{K}$) than locally. This is due to the more compact GMC structure
induced by the higher gas pressure and turbulence characterizing early
galaxies. The compactness also delays GMC dispersal by stellar feedback, thus
$\sim 40\%$ of the total UV radiation emitted by newly born stars remains
obscured. A higher $T_d$ has additional implications: it (a) reduces the
tension between local and high-$z$ IRX-$\beta$ relation, (b) alleviates the
problem of the uncomfortably large dust masses deduced from observations of
some EoR galaxies.

data-driven model to estimate the cosmic merger rate density (MRD) evolution of
CBs, by coupling catalogs of CB mergers with observational constraints on the
cosmic star formation rate density and on the metallicity evolution of the
Universe. We adopt catalogs of CB mergers derived from recent $N-$body and
population-synthesis simulations, to describe the MRD of CBs formed in young
star clusters (hereafter, dynamical CBs) and in the field (hereafter, isolated
CBs). The local MRD of dynamical BBHs is $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BBH}=67^{+29}_{-23}$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the 90% credible interval from the first
and second observing run (O1 and O2) of the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, and with
the local MRD of isolated BBHs ($\mathcal{R}_{\rm BBH}=49^{+79}_{-37}$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$). The local MRD of dynamical and isolated black
hole-neutron star binaries (BHNSs) is $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BHNS}=38^{+32}_{-24}$
and $45^{+45}_{-32}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Both values are
consistent with the upper limit inferred from O1 and O2. Finally, the local MRD
of dynamical binary neutron stars (BNSs, $\mathcal{R}_{\rm
BNS}=150^{+56}_{-40}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) is a factor of two lower than the
local MRD of BNSs formed in isolated binaries ($\mathcal{R}_{\rm
BNS}=281^{+109}_{-75}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$). The MRD for all CB classes grows
with redshift, reaching its maximum at $z \in [1.5,2.5]$, and then decreases.
This trend springs from the interplay between cosmic star formation rate,
metallicity evolution and delay time of binary compact objects.

  a LIRG","  VV 655, a dwarf irregular galaxy with HI tidal debris, is a companion to the
lenticular luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) NGC 4418. NGC 4418 stands out among
nearby LIRGs due to its dense central concentration of molecular gas and the
dusty, bi-polar structures along its minor axis suggestive of a wind driven by
a central starburst and possible nuclear activity. We seek to understand the
consequences of the ongoing minor interaction between VV 655 and NGC 4418 for
the evolution of the LIRG, including the origin of the gas supply responsible
for its unusual nuclear properties. We investigate the structural, kinematic,
and chemical properties of VV 655 and NGC 4418 by analyzing archival imaging
data and optical spectroscopic observations from the SDSS-III and new spectra
from SALT-RSS. We characterize their gas-phase metal abundances and spatially
resolved, ionized gas kinematics, and demonstrate that the gas-phase
metallicity in NGC 4418 significantly exceeds that in VV 655. No kinematic
disturbances in the ionized gas are observed along the minor axis of NGC 4418,
but we see evidence for ionized gas outflows from VV 655 that may increase the
cross-section for gas stripping in grazing collisions. A faint, asymmetric
outer arm is detected in NGC 4418 of the type normally associated with
galaxy-galaxy interactions. The simplest model suggests that the minor
interaction between VV 655 and NGC 4418 produced the unusual nuclear properties
of the LIRG via tidal torquing of the interstellar medium of NGC 4418 rather
than through a significant gas transfer event. In addition to inducing a
central concentration of gas in NGC 4418, this interaction also produced an
enhanced star formation rate and an outer tidal arm in the LIRG. The VV 655-NGC
4418 system offers an example of the potential for minor collisions to alter
the evolutionary pathways of giant galaxies.

freedom (amplitude, phase and polarization), and has proven instrumental in
many applications. The creation of structured light usually involves the
conversion of a Gaussian mode to a desired structure in a single step, while
the detection is often the reverse process, both fundamentally lossy or
imperfect. Here we show how to ideally reshape structured light in a lossless
manner in a simple two-step process. We outline the core theoretical arguments,
and demonstrate reshaping of arbitrary structured light patterns, in the
process highlighting when the technique is applicable and when not, and how
best to implement it. This work will be a useful addition to the structured

  Diffuse Galaxies show a broad distribution in their stellar kinematics","  In recent years a new window on galaxy evolution opened, thanks to the
increasing discovery of galaxies with a low surface brightness, such as Ultra
Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs). The formation mechanism of these systems is still a
much debated question, and so are their kinematical properties. In this work,
we address this topic by analyzing the stellar kinematics of isolated UDGs
formed in the hydrodynamical simulation suite NIHAO. We construct projected
line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion maps to compute the projected
specific angular momentum, $\lambda_{\rm R}$, to characterize the kinematical
support of the stars in these galaxies. We found that UDGs cover a broad
distribution, ranging from dispersion to rotation supported galaxies, with
similar abundances in both regimes. The degree of rotation support of simulated
UDGs correlates with several properties such as galaxy morphology, higher HI
fractions and larger effective radii with respect to the dispersion supported
group, while the dark matter halo spin and mass accretion history are similar
amongst the two populations. We demonstrate that the alignment of the infalling
baryons into the protogalaxy at early $z$ is the principal driver of the $z$=0
stellar kinematic state: pressure supported isolated UDGs form via mis-aligned
gas accretion while rotation supported ones build-up their baryons in an
ordered manner. Accounting for random inclination effects, we predict that a
comprehensive survey will find nearly half of field UDGs to have rotationally
supported stellar disks.

of the Einstein-Proca system. Firstly, fully non-linear dynamical evolutions of
the Kerr black hole superradiant instability, triggered by a Proca field, have
shown the formation of a new equilibrium state, a spinning black hole with
synchronised Proca hair. Secondly, non-linear evolutions of spinning Proca
stars have established that they are dynamically stable, unlike their scalar
cousins. Thirdy, separability of the Proca equation on the Kerr background has
been achieved. Motivated by these results, in this paper we reconsider Kerr
black holes with synchronised Proca hair. The separability of the Proca
equation on the Kerr background allows us to examine the stationary Proca
clouds in greater detail, in particular their dependence on the different
quantum numbers. These stationary clouds occur at a set of existence lines in
the Kerr parameter space, from which the black holes with synchronised Proca
hair bifurcate. We construct the domain of existence of these black holes,
comparing the fundamental states missed in the original study with the first
excited states and with the cousin scalar model, giving illustrative examples
of Kerr-like and non-Kerr-like BHs. In the vanishing event horizon limit, these
hairy black holes connect to the fundamental states of spinning Proca stars,
which include the dynamically stable solutions.

  Scattering","  Spectral modification of energetic magnetar flares by resonant cyclotron
scattering (RCS) is considered. During energetic flares, photons emitted from
the magnetically-trapped fireball near the stellar surface should resonantly
interact with magnetospheric electrons or positrons. We show by a simple
thought experiment that such scattering particles are expected to move at
mildly relativistic speeds along closed magnetic field lines, which would
slightly shift the incident photon energy due to the Doppler effect. We develop
a toy model for the spectral modification by a single RCS that incorporates
both a realistic seed photon spectrum from the trapped fireball and the
velocity field of particles, which is unique to the flaring magnetosphere. We
show that our spectral model can be effectively characterized by a single
parameter; the effective temperature of the fireball, which enables us to fit
observed spectra with low computational cost. We demonstrate that our single
scattering model is in remarkable agreement with Swift/BAT data of intermediate
flares from SGR 1900+14, corresponding to effective fireball temperatures of
$T_{\rm eff}=6$-$7$ keV, whereas BeppoSAX/GRBM data of giant flares from the
same source may need more elaborate models including the effect of multiple
scatterings. Nevertheless, since there is no standard physically-motivated
model for magnetar flare spectra, our model could be a useful tool to study
magnetar bursts, shedding light on the hidden properties of the flaring
magnetosphere.

  simulations, theory and application to the COSMOS2015 data","  Cosmological analyses of galaxy surveys rely on knowledge of the redshift
distribution of their galaxy sample. This is usually derived from a
spectroscopic and/or many-band photometric calibrator survey of a small patch
of sky. The uncertainties in the redshift distribution of the calibrator sample
include a contribution from shot noise, or Poisson sampling errors, but, given
the small volume they probe, they are dominated by sample variance introduced
by large-scale structures. Redshift uncertainties have been shown to constitute
one of the leading contributions to systematic uncertainties in cosmological
inferences from weak lensing and galaxy clustering, and hence they must be
propagated through the analyses. In this work, we study the effects of sample
variance on small-area redshift surveys, from theory to simulations to the
COSMOS2015 data set. We present a three-step Dirichlet method of resampling a
given survey-based redshift calibration distribution to enable the propagation
of both shot noise and sample variance uncertainties. The method can
accommodate different levels of prior confidence on different redshift sources.
This method can be applied to any calibration sample with known redshifts and
phenotypes (i.e. cells in a self-organizing map, or some other way of
discretizing photometric space), and provides a simple way of propagating prior
redshift uncertainties into cosmological analyses. As a worked example, we
apply the full scheme to the COSMOS2015 data set, for which we also present a
new, principled SOM algorithm designed to handle noisy photometric data. We
make available a catalog of the resulting resamplings of the COSMOS2015
galaxies.

three different subjects in Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (Spain), we study
the differences in assessments by dividing students into two groups. The first
group (control) corresponds to academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The
second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is
the group of students that interrupted their face-to-face activities because of
the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect
of the COVID-19 confinement on students performance. This effect is also
significative in activities that did not change their format when performed
after the confinement. We find that this effect is significative both in
subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that
did not change the workload of students. Additionally, an analysis of students
learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study in a
continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement
changed students learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving
their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students assessment are
expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in
their learning performance.

defined in terms of a design matrix, and each codeword is a generated by
multiplying the design matrix with a sparse message vector. In the standard
SPARC construction, information is encoded in the locations of the non-zero
entries of the message vector. In this paper we generalize the construction and
consider modulated SPARCs, where information in encoded in both the locations
and the values of the non-zero entries of the message vector. We focus on the
case where the non-zero entries take values from a Phase Shift Keying (PSK)
constellation. We propose a computationally efficient Approximate Message
Passing (AMP) decoder, and obtain analytical bounds on the state evolution
parameters which predict the error performance of the decoder. Using these
bounds we show that PSK-modulated SPARCs are asymptotically capacity achieving
for the complex AWGN channel, with either spatial coupling or power allocation.
We also provide numerical simulation results to demonstrate the error
performance at finite code lengths. These results show that introducing
modulation to the SPARC design can significantly reduce decoding complexity
without sacrificing error performance.

importance. We argue that one way to achieve this is to proactively cultivate
public pressure for ML developers to design and develop fairer algorithms --
and that one way to cultivate public pressure while simultaneously serving the
interests and objectives of algorithm developers is through gameplay. We
propose a new class of games -- ``games for fairness and interpretability'' --
as one example of an incentive-aligned approach for producing fairer and more
equitable algorithms. Games for fairness and interpretability are
carefully-designed games with mass appeal. They are inherently engaging,
provide insights into how machine learning models work, and ultimately produce
data that helps researchers and developers improve their algorithms. We
highlight several possible examples of games, their implications for fairness
and interpretability, how their proliferation could creative positive public
pressure by narrowing the gap between algorithm developers and the general
public, and why the machine learning community could benefit from them.

mm-wavelength counterparts but do not have cm-wavelength counterparts and are
therefore candidate HCHII regions; of these, 10 are morphologically compact and
are strong candidates for new HCHII regions. Given the limited number of
candidates in the extended area in this survey compared to the relatively large

exist within dense protoclusters. Comparing the counts of HCHII to ultracompact

  Using Multiple Lane Changes","  This paper presents a model to estimate the probability of reaching a
near-term goal state based on parameters corresponding to traffic flow and
driving behavior. In recent years developing accurate models of driver behavior
and control algorithms for lane changes has been an integral part of research
on autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistant systems (ADAS). However,
there has not been many attempts at accurately estimating the probability that
a vehicle can reach a near-term goal state using multiple, successive lane
changes. Knowing this information can help design advance warning systems that
increase driver safety and traffic throughput, and improve the cooperative
behavior of autonomous vehicles. The model presented in this paper is first
formulated for a two-lane road segment by systematically reducing the number of
parameters involved and transforming the problem into an abstract form, for
which the probability can be calculated numerically. The model is then extended
to cases with a higher number of lanes using the law of total probability.
VISSIM simulations are used to validate the predictions of the model and study
the effect of different parameters on the probability. For most cases,
simulation results are within four percent of model predictions, and the effect
of different parameters such as driving behavior and traffic density on the
probability matches our intuition. The model is implemented with near real-time
performance and calculation time increases linearly with the number of lanes.

entanglement transition as a function of the measurement rate. This transition
is generally understood in terms of a competition between scrambling due to
unitary dynamics and the disentangling effects of measurements. We find that,
surprisingly, entanglement transitions are possible even in the absence of
scrambling unitary dynamics. We illustrate this phenomenon in models where the
unitary dynamics is non-scrambling, as well as for systems in which the
dynamics is entirely due to local few-site measurements. This opens the door to
a vast landscape of measurement-only models, in which the ""scrambling"" and
""un-scrambling"" effects that drive the entanglement transition are not
separable into distinct physical processes. We show numerical results on the
entanglement phase diagrams, critical points, and locality properties of some
of these measurement-only models. We find that an entangling (volume-law) phase
is the default outcome, while disentangling (area-law) phases are possible in
the presence of special restrictions on the size or commutativity of the
measurements. We propose ""frustration"" of the measurement ensemble as the
principle driving the entanglement transition in this class of dynamics.

point-to-point model predictive control concepts for nonlinear systems. Recent
approaches in the literature apply a time transformation, however, which do not
maintain recursive feasibility for piecewise constant control parameterization.
The key idea in this paper is to introduce uniform grids with variable
discretization. A shrinking-horizon grid adaptation scheme ensures convergence
to a specific region around the target state and recursive feasibility. The
size of the region is configurable by design parameters. This facilitates the
systematic dual-mode design for quasi-time-optimal control to restore
asymptotic stability and establish a smooth stabilization. Two nonlinear
program formulations with different sparsity patterns are introduced to realize
and implement the underlying optimal control problem. For a class of numerical
integration schemes, even nominal asymptotic stability and true time-optimality
are achieved without dual-mode. A comparative analysis as well as experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

re-estimating the parameter on the trimmed sample set. We show that the method
in logarithmic iterations outputs an estimation whose error only depends on the

mobile colloids trapped at planar fluid-fluid interfaces. We consider both
externally driven colloids and active colloids (swimmers) either adjacent to or
adhered to the interface. In the latter case, we assume a pinned contact line.
The Reynolds and capillary numbers are assumed small, in line with typical
colloidal systems involving air- or alkane-aqueous interfaces. At clean
(surfactant-free) interfaces, the hydrodynamic modes are essentially a
restricted set of the usual Stokes multipoles in a bulk fluid. To leading
order, driven colloids simply exert Stokelets parallel to the interface, while
active colloids drive different kinds of fluid motion depending on their
trapped configuration. We then consider how these modes are altered by the
presence of an incompressible surfactant layer, which occurs at high Marangoni
numbers. This limiting behavior is typical for colloidal-scale systems at small
capillary numbers, even when scant surfactant is present. Compared to a clean
interface, we find that incompressibility substantially weakens flow directed
normal to the interface. Interestingly, for both driven and active colloids, we
find that the leading-order flow normal to the interface is associated with
colloid asymmetry with respect to the interfacial plane. Flow parallel to the
interface, however, is not weakened. Moreover, surface-viscous stresses, if
present, potentially generate very long-ranged flow on the interface itself and
into the surrounding fluids. We examine the limiting forms of such flows. Our
results have important implications for advective mass transport enhancement
near fluid boundaries.

multi-messenger astronomy is presented that unifies the thermodynamics of quark
and hadronic degrees of freedom. A Lagrangian approach to the thermodynamic
potential of quark-meson-nucleon (QMN) matter is used where dynamical
chiral-symmetry breaking is described by the scalar mean-field dynamics coupled
to quarks as well as to nucleons and their chiral partners, whereby its
restoration occurs in the hadronic phase by parity doubling as well as in the
quark phase. Quark confinement is achieved by an auxiliary scalar field that
parametrizes a dynamical infrared cutoff in the quark sector, serving as an
ultraviolet cutoff for the nucleonic phase-space. The gap equations are solved
for the isospin-symmetric case as well as for neutron star (NS) conditions. The
mass-radius (MR) relation of NSs and their tidal deformability (TD) parameter
are calculated. The obtained EoS is in accordance with nuclear matter
properties at saturation density and with the flow constraint from heavy ion
collision experiments. For isospin-asymmetric matter a sequential occurrence of
light quark flavors is obtained, allowing for a mixed phase of
chirally-symmetric nucleonic matter with deconfined down quarks. The MR
relations and TDs for compact stars fulfill the constraints from latest
astrophysical observations for PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, and the NS
merger GW170817, whereby the tension between the maximum mass and compactness
constraints rather uniquely fixes the model parameters. The model predicts the
existence of stars with a core of chirally restored but purely hadronic
(confined) matter for masses beyond $1.8~M_\odot$. Stars with pure-quark matter
cores are found to be unstable against the gravitational collapse. This
instability is shifted still to higher densities if repulsive interactions
between quarks are included.

combined with the known distance to the Cygnus Loop provide an accurate shock
speed. Earlier analyses of shock spectra estimated the shock speed, postshock
density, temperature, and elemental abundances. In this paper we determine
several more shock parameters: a more accurate shock speed, ram pressure,
density, compression ratio, dust destruction efficiency, magnetic field
strength, and vorticity in the cooling region. From the derived shock
properties we estimate the emissivities of synchrotron emission in the radio
and pion decay emission in the gamma rays. Both are consistent with the
observations if we assume simple adiabatic compression of ambient cosmic rays
as in the van der Laan mechanism. We also find that, although the morphology is
far from that predicted by 1D models and the line ratios vary dramatically from
point to point, the average spectrum is matched reasonably well by 1D shock
models with the shock speed derived from the measured proper motion. A
subsequent paper will analyze the development of turbulence in the cooling zone

any choice of renormalization scheme; renormalized entanglement entropy in
holographic settings is expressed in terms of renormalized areas of extremal
surfaces. In this paper we show how holographic renormalized entanglement
entropy can be expressed in terms of the Euler invariant of the surface and
renormalized curvature invariants. For a spherical entangling region in an
odd-dimensional CFT, the renormalized entanglement entropy is proportional to
the Euler invariant of the holographic entangling surface, with the coefficient
of proportionality capturing the (renormalized) F quantity. Variations of the
entanglement entropy can be expressed elegantly in terms of renormalized
curvature invariants, facilitating general proofs of the first law of
entanglement.

and its sound speed and (shear) viscosity in 9 redshift bins, finding no
convincing evidence for non-$\Lambda$CDM values in any of the redshift bins.
Despite this enlarged parameter space, the sound speed and viscosity are
constrained relatively well at late times (due to the inclusion of CMB

These results constrain for the first time the level of ''coldness'' required

frequently employed in popular efficient architectures can also result in
negative activation values, with skewed positive and negative ranges. Typical
learnable quantization schemes [PACT, LSQ] assume unsigned quantization for
activations and quantize all negative activations to zero which leads to
significant loss in performance. Naively using signed quantization to
accommodate these negative values requires an extra sign bit which is expensive
for low-bit (2-, 3-, 4-bit) quantization. To solve this problem, we propose
LSQ+, a natural extension of LSQ, wherein we introduce a general asymmetric
quantization scheme with trainable scale and offset parameters that can learn
to accommodate the negative activations. Gradient-based learnable quantization
schemes also commonly suffer from high instability or variance in the final
training performance, hence requiring a great deal of hyper-parameter tuning to
reach a satisfactory performance. LSQ+ alleviates this problem by using an
MSE-based initialization scheme for the quantization parameters. We show that
this initialization leads to significantly lower variance in final performance
across multiple training runs. Overall, LSQ+ shows state-of-the-art results for
EfficientNet and MixNet and also significantly outperforms LSQ for low-bit
quantization of neural nets with Swish activations (e.g.: 1.8% gain with W4A4
quantization and upto 5.6% gain with W2A2 quantization of EfficientNet-B0 on

the relative variations in per-phase loading and associated voltage unbalance
are expected to increase. High voltage unbalance may increase network losses
and lead to failure of three-phase equipment such as motor loads. However,
solar PV panels are connected to the grid through inverters, which can provide
reactive power support and may mitigate some of these negative effects. In this
paper, we utilize a three-phase AC optimal power flow (OPF) formulation to
minimize voltage unbalance using reactive power from solar PV inverters. When
considering actions to reduce voltage unbalance, it is important to recognize
that various organizations such as IEC, NEMA and IEEE provide different and
partially inconsistent definitions of voltage unbalance in their power quality
standards. This paper analyzes the impact of the different voltage unbalance
metrics using different combinations of voltage unbalance objectives and
constraints. For our analysis, the optimization scheme is tested on two
unbalanced low-voltage distribution networks. We observe that minimizing
voltage unbalance defined by one standard might actually increase voltage
unbalance as defined by another standard, potentially resulting in equipment
damage. We also observe that minimizing voltage unbalance does not always lead
to lower network losses. However, considerable reduction in voltage unbalance
with low network losses can be achieved by minimizing the losses while
simultaneously enforcing limits on multiple definitions of voltage unbalance.

be mechanically unstable with only central force interactions. Despite the fact
that networks such as collagen can be stabilized by bending interactions, it
has been shown that they can undergo a transition from floppy to rigid when
subject to strain. Although this athermal transition is critical in nature, the

scaling behavior of this transition and identify both the mechanical
discontinuity and non-mean-field critical exponents in the thermodynamic limit.
We find both non-mean-field behavior and evidence for a hyperscaling relation

which time their interior compositions remain relatively unaltered. Cometary
observations can therefore provide direct insight into the chemistry that
occurred during their birth at the time of planet formation. To-date, there
have been no confirmed observations of parent volatiles (gases released
directly from the nucleus) of a comet from any planetary system other than our
own. Here we present high-resolution, interferometric observations of
2I/Borisov, the first confirmed interstellar comet, obtained using the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) on 15th-16th December 2019. Our
observations reveal emission from hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and carbon monoxide
(CO), coincident with the expected position of 2I/Borisov's nucleus, with
production rates Q(HCN)=$(7.0\pm1.1)\times10^{23}$ s$^{-1}$ and
Q(CO)=$(4.4\pm0.7)\times10^{26}$ s$^{-1}$. While the HCN abundance relative to
water (0.06-0.16%) appears similar to that of typical, previously observed
comets in our Solar System, the abundance of CO (35-105%) is among the highest
observed in any comet within 2~au of the Sun. This shows that 2I/Borisov must
have formed in a relatively CO-rich environment - probably beyond the CO
ice-line in the very cold, outer regions of a distant protoplanetary accretion
disk, as part of a population of small, icy bodies analogous to our Solar
System's own proto-Kuiper Belt.

mechanisms, symmetries, and spectra of particles. Consequently, the space of
observational signatures is similarly complex. Hence, it is natural to look for
boundaries of the space of models and their signatures. In this paper, we
explore the possible symmetries associated with the primordial cosmological
perturbations and their correlators in the asymptotic future. Assuming the
observed homogeneity, isotropy and (approximate) scale invariance, we prove
three main results. First, correlation functions of scalar metric fluctuations
are uniquely characterized by soft theorems and are free from ambiguity under
field redefinitions. Second, whatever the particle content and interactions,
when the standard soft theorems apply, invariance under de Sitter boosts
(linearly realized conformal invariance) is only possible if all connected
correlators vanish identically, i.e. if the theory is free. Third, conformal
invariance is the largest set of linearly realized (bosonic) symmetries of the
correlators of any single scalar, irrespectively of any soft theorems or
particle content.

A huge number, but only when we are ready to assume the given database is
homogenous, consisting of a large cohort of ""similar"" cases. Why we need the
homogeneity assumption? To make `learning from the experience of others' or
`borrowing strength' possible. But, what if, we are dealing with a massive
database of heterogeneous cases (which is a norm in almost all modern
data-science applications including neuroscience, genomics, healthcare, and
astronomy)? How many methods we have in this situation? Not much, if not ZERO.
Why? It's not obvious how to go about gathering strength when each piece of
information is fuzzy. The danger is that, if we include irrelevant cases,
borrowing information might heavily damage the quality of the inference! This
raises some fundamental questions for big data inference: When (not) to borrow?
Whom (not) to borrow? How (not) to borrow? These questions are at the heart of
the ""Problem of Relevance"" in statistical inference -- a puzzle that has
remained too little addressed since its inception nearly half a century ago.
  Here we offer the first practical theory of relevance with precisely
describable statistical formulation and algorithm. Through examples, we
demonstrate how our new statistical perspective answers previously unanswerable

weakened form of the independence property and hence satisfied in expected

well-documented and several preference theories, notably cumulative prospect
theory (CPT), do not satisfy betweenness. We prove that CPT preferences satisfy
betweenness if and only if they conform with EUT preferences. In game theory,
lack of betweenness in the players' preference relations makes it essential to
distinguish between the two interpretations of a mixed action by a player -
conscious randomizations by the player and the uncertainty in the beliefs of
the opponents. We elaborate on this distinction and study its implication for
the definition of Nash equilibrium. This results in four different notions of

dub the other two pure and mixed black-box strategy Nash equilibrium

of PDS 70 c is less well constrained, with a range of total luminosities
spanning an order of magnitude. With our inferred radii and luminosities, we
used evolutionary models of accreting protoplanets to derive a mass of PDS 70 b

narrative frameworks. In their comments about a novel, readers generally

limited perspective on that work. Yet in aggregate, these reviews capture an
underlying narrative framework comprised of different actants (people, places,
things), their roles, and interactions that we label the ""consensus narrative
framework"". We represent this framework in the form of an actant-relationship
story graph. Extracting this graph is a challenging computational problem,
which we pose as a latent graphical model estimation problem. Posts and reviews
are viewed as samples of sub graphs/networks of the hidden narrative framework.
Inspired by the qualitative narrative theory of Greimas, we formulate a
graphical generative Machine Learning (ML) model where nodes represent actants,
and multi-edges and self-loops among nodes capture context-specific
relationships. We develop a pipeline of interlocking automated methods to
extract key actants and their relationships, and apply it to thousands of

compare relationships in ground truth networks with our extracted networks. We
find that our automated methodology generates highly accurate consensus
narrative frameworks: for our four target novels, with approximately 2900
reviews per novel, we report average coverage/recall of important relationships
of > 80% and an average edge detection rate of >89\%. These extracted narrative
frameworks can generate insight into how people (or classes of people) read and
how they recount what they have read to others.

existence of echo-chambers along two main dimensions: homophily in the
interaction networks and bias in the information diffusion toward likely-minded
peers. We find peculiar differences across social media. Indeed, while Facebook
and Twitter present clear-cut echo chambers in all the observed dataset, Reddit
and Gab do not. Finally, we test the role of the social media platform on news
consumption by comparing Reddit and Facebook. Again, we find support for the
hypothesis that platforms implementing news feed algorithms like Facebook may

remarkable impact on power system operation, mainly in terms of security and
reliability due to the inherent loss of the rotational inertia as a consequence
of such new generation units decoupled from the grid. In these weak scenarios,
the contribution of wind turbines to frequency control is considered as a
suitable solution to improve system stability. With regard to frequency
response analysis and grid stability, most contributions introduce wind control
discuss generation tripping for isolated power systems under arbitrary power
imbalance conditions. Frequency response is then analyzed for hypothetical
imbalances usually ranged between 5% and 20%, and assuming averaged energy
schedule scenarios. In this paper, a more realistic framework is proposed to
evaluate frequency deviations by including high wind power integration. With
this aim, unit commitment schemes and frequency load shedding are considered in
this work for frequency response analysis under high wind power penetration.
The Gran Canaria Island's isolated power system (Spain) is used for evaluation
purposes. Results provide a variety of influences from wind frequency control
depending not only on the wind power integration, but also the generation units
under operation, the rotational inertia reductions as well as the available
reserves from each resource, aspects that have not been addressed previously in
the specific literature to evaluate frequency excursions under high wind power
integration.

Several sages wearing colored hats occupy the vertices of a graph, $k$-th sage
can have hats of one of $h(k)$ colors. Each sage tries to guess the color of
his own hat merely on the basis of observing the hats of his neighbors without
exchanging any information. A predetermined guessing strategy is winning if it
guarantees at least one correct individual guess for every assignment of
colors.
  For complete graphs and for cycles we solve the problem of describing
functions $h(k)$ for which the sages win. We demonstrate here winning
strategies for the sages on complete graphs, and analyze the Hats game on
almost complete graphs. We develop ""theory of constructors"", that is a
collection of theorems demonstrating how one can construct new graphs for which
the sages win. We define also new game ""Check by rook"" which is equivalent to
Hats game on 4-cycle and give complete analysis of this game.

on their orbit through the Galaxy's halo. Many physical properties of the
Leading Arm, such as its mass and size, are poorly constrained because it has
few distance measurements. While H$\alpha$ measurements have been used to
estimate the distances to halo clouds, many studies have been unsuccessful in
detecting H$\alpha$ from the Leading Arm. In this study, we explore a group of
H I clouds which lie $75^{\circ} - 90^{\circ}$ from the Magellanic Clouds.
Through ultraviolet and 21-cm radio spectroscopy, this region, dubbed the
Leading Arm Extension, was found to have chemical and kinematic similarities to
the Leading Arm. Using the Wisconsin H$\alpha$ Mapper, we detect H$\alpha$
emission in four out of seven of our targets. Assuming that this region is
predominantly photoionized, we use a radiation model that incorporates the
contributions of the Galaxy, Magellanic Clouds, and the extragalactic
background at $\rm z = 0$ to derive a heliocentric distance of
$d_{\odot}\ge13.4~kpc$. We also use this model to rederive H$\alpha$ distances
of $d_{\odot} \geq 5.0$ kpc and $d_{\odot} \geq 22.9~kpc$ to two clouds in the
literature that might also be associated with the Leading Arm. Using these new
measurements, and others in the literature, we provide a general trend of the
variation of Leading Arm heliocentric distance as a function of Magellanic
Stream longitude, and explore its implications for the origin and closest point
of approach of the Leading Arm.

  Software, and Performance","  Clustering points in a vector space or nodes in a graph is a ubiquitous
primitive in statistical data analysis, and it is commonly used for exploratory
data analysis. In practice, it is often of interest to ""refine"" or ""improve"" a
given cluster that has been obtained by some other method. In this survey, we
focus on principled algorithms for this cluster improvement problem. Many such
cluster improvement algorithms are flow-based methods, by which we mean that
operationally they require the solution of a sequence of maximum flow problems
on a (typically implicitly) modified data graph. These cluster improvement
algorithms are powerful, both in theory and in practice, but they have not been
widely adopted for problems such as community detection, local graph
clustering, semi-supervised learning, etc. Possible reasons for this are: the
steep learning curve for these algorithms; the lack of efficient and easy to
use software; and the lack of detailed numerical experiments on real-world data
that demonstrate their usefulness. Our objective here is to address these
issues. To do so, we guide the reader through the whole process of
understanding how to implement and apply these powerful algorithms. We present
a unifying fractional programming optimization framework that permits us to
distill out in a simple way the crucial components of all these algorithms. It
also makes apparent similarities and differences between related methods.
Viewing these cluster improvement algorithms via a fractional programming
framework suggests directions for future algorithm development. Finally, we
develop efficient implementations of these algorithms in our
LocalGraphClustering python package, and we perform extensive numerical
experiments to demonstrate the performance of these methods on social networks
and image-based data graphs.

thin flux tube approximation, the cut-off periods of slow-mode
magneto-acoustic-gravity waves that travel from the photosphere to the corona

specific heat coefficient at constant pressure $c_{\mathrm{p}}$ value led to an
inconsistency in the cut-off calculation, which is only significant at the
transition region. Due to the abrupt temperature change in the region, a change
of the mean atomic weight (by a factor of approximately two) also occurs, but
is often overlooked in analytical models for simplicity purposes. In this
paper, we revisit the calculation of the cut-off periods of
magneto-acoustic-gravity waves in Costa et al. (2018) by considering an
atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium with a temperature profile, with the
inclusion of the variation of the mean atomic weight and the correction of the
inconsistency aforementioned. In addition, we show that the cut-off periods
obtained analytically are consistent with the corresponding periods measured in
observations of a particular active region.

might be unwilling to share their information, which increases the interest in

Mathematical proofs and numerical analysis are conducted to evaluate existing
privacy-preserving methods divided into three categories: data transformation,
secure multi-party computations, and decomposition methods. The analysis shows
that state-of-the-art techniques have limitations in preserving data privacy,
such as a trade-off between privacy and the correct estimation of model

shared can be exploited so that the original data can be inferred after some
iterations.

  Graph Fourier Transform","  Networked nonlinear dynamics underpin the complex functionality of many
engineering, social, biological, and ecological systems. Monitoring the
networked dynamics via the minimum subset of nodes is essential for a variety
of scientific and operational purposes. When there is a lack of a explicit
model and networked signal space, traditional evolution analysis and non-convex
methods are insufficient. An important data-driven state-of-the-art method use
the Koopman operator to generate a linear evolution model for a vector-valued
observable of original state-space. As a result, one can derive a sampling
strategy via the linear evolution property of observable. However, current
polynomial Koopman operators result in a large sampling space due to: (i) the
large size of polynomial based observables ($O(N^2)$, $N$ number of nodes in
network), and (ii) not factoring in the nonlinear dependency between
observables.
  In this work, to achieve linear scaling ($O(N)$) and a small set of sampling
nodes, we propose to combine a novel Log-Koopman operator and nonlinear Graph
Fourier Transform (NL-GFT) scheme. First, the Log-Koopman operator is able to
reduce the size of observables by transforming multiplicative poly-observable
to logarithm summation. Second, a nonlinear GFT concept and sampling theory are
provided to exploit the nonlinear dependence of observables for Koopman
linearized evolution analysis. Combined, the sampling and reconstruction
algorithms are designed and demonstrated on two established application areas.
The results demonstrate that the proposed Log-Koopman NL-GFT scheme can (i)
linearize unknown nonlinear dynamics using $O(N)$ observables, and (ii) achieve
lower number of sampling nodes, compared with the state-of-the art polynomial
Koopman linear evolution analysis.

  For Its Efficient Computation","  As the use of MultiLayer Networks (or MLNs) for modeling and analysis is
gaining popularity, it is becoming increasingly important to propose a
community definition that encompasses the multiple features represented by MLNs
and develop algorithms for efficiently computing communities on MLNs.
Currently, communities for MLNs, are based on aggregating the networks into
single graphs using different techniques (type independent, projection-based,
etc.) and applying single graph community detection algorithms, such as Louvain
and Infomap on these graphs. This process results in different types of
information loss (semantics and structure). To the best of our knowledge, in
this paper we propose, for the first time, a definition of community for
heterogeneous MLNs (or HeMLNs) which preserves semantics as well as the
structure. Additionally, our basic definition can be extended to appropriately
match the analysis objectives as needed.
  In this paper, we present a structure and semantics preserving community
definition for HeMLNs that is compatible with and is an extension of the
traditional definition for single graphs. We also present a framework for its
efficient computation using a newly proposed decoupling approach. First, we
define a k-community for connected k layers of a HeMLN. Then we propose a
family of algorithms for its computation using the concept of bipartite graph
pairings. Further, for a broader analysis, we introduce several pairing
algorithms and weight metrics for composing binary HeMLN communities using
participating community characteristics. Essentially, this results in an
extensible family of community computations. We provide extensive experimental
results for showcasing the efficiency and analysis flexibility of the proposed
computation using popular IMDb and DBLP data sets.

the asymptotic variance is not analytically tractable. Bootstrap inference
offers a feasible solution but can be computationally costly especially when
the model is complex. This paper uses iterates of a specially designed
stochastic optimization algorithm as draws from which both point estimates and
bootstrap standard errors can be computed in a single run. The draws are
generated by the gradient and Hessian computed from batches of data that are
resampled at each iteration. We show that these draws yield consistent
estimates and asymptotically valid frequentist inference for a large class of
regular problems. The algorithm provides accurate standard errors in simulation
examples and empirical applications at low computational costs. The draws from
the algorithm also provide a convenient way to detect data irregularities.

Linear Unit (ReLU) Neural Network (NN) architecture (number of layers and
number of neurons per layer) with the guarantee that it is sufficiently
parametrized to control a nonlinear system. Whereas current state-of-the-art
techniques are based on hand-picked architectures or heuristic based search to
find such NN architectures, our approach exploits the given model of the system
to design an architecture; as a result, we provide a guarantee that the
resulting NN architecture is sufficient to implement a controller that
satisfies an achievable specification. Our approach exploits two basic ideas.
First, assuming that the system can be controlled by an unknown
Lipschitz-continuous state-feedback controller with some Lipschitz constant
upper-bounded by $K_\text{cont}$, we bound the number of affine functions
needed to construct a Continuous Piecewise Affine (CPWA) function that can
approximate the unknown Lipschitz-continuous controller. Second, we utilize the
authors' recent results on a novel NN architecture named as the Two-Level
Lattice (TLL) NN architecture, which was shown to be capable of implementing
any CPWA function just from the knowledge of the number of affine functions
that compromises this CPWA function.

self-supervised auxiliary task that utilizes the tube-like structure of axons

constrains a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the order of
permuted slices in an input 3D volume. By solving this task, the 3D CNN is able
to learn features without ground-truth labels that are useful for downstream
segmentation with the 3D U-Net model. To the best of our knowledge, our model

  Q-Learning with n-Step Bootstrapping","  Surveillance camera networks are a useful infrastructure for various visual
analytics applications, where high-level inferences and predictions could be
made based on target tracking across the network. Most multi-camera tracking
works focus on target re-identification and trajectory association problems to
track the target. However, since camera networks can generate enormous amount
of video data, inefficient schemes for making re-identification or trajectory
association queries can incur prohibitively large computational requirements.
In this paper, we address the problem of intelligent scheduling of
re-identification queries in a multi-camera tracking setting. To this end, we
formulate the target tracking problem in a camera network as an MDP and learn a
reinforcement learning based policy that selects a camera for making a
re-identification query. The proposed approach to camera selection does not
assume the knowledge of the camera network topology but the resulting policy
implicitly learns it. We have also shown that such a policy can be learnt
directly from data. Using the NLPR MCT and the Duke MTMC multi-camera
multi-target tracking benchmarks, we empirically show that the proposed
approach substantially reduces the number of frames queried.

  Robotic Surgery","  Purpose: Previous research has shown that obtaining non-expert crowd
evaluations of surgical performances concords with the gold standard of expert
surgeon review, and that faster playback speed increases ratings for videos of
higher-skilled surgeons in laparoscopic simulation. The aim of this research is
to extend this investigation to real surgeries that use non-expert crowd
evaluations. We address two questions (1) whether crowds award more favorable
ratings to videos shown at increased playback speeds, and (2) if crowd
evaluations of the first minute of a surgical procedure differ from crowd
evaluations of the entire performance. Methods: A set of 56 videos of
practicing surgeons were used to evaluate the technical skill of the surgeons
at each video playback speed used for the first minute of the previously rated
performance, using the GEARS assessment criteria. Results: Crowds on average
did rate videos higher as playback speed was increased. This effect was
observed for both proficient and expert surgeons. Each increase in the playback
speed by 0.8x was associated with, on average, a 0.16-point increase in the
GEARS score for expert surgeons and a 0.27-point increase in GEARS score for
proficient surgeons, with both groups being perceived as obtaining relatively
equal skill at the fastest playback speed. It was also found that 22 out of the
56 surgeons were perceived to be significantly different in skill when just
viewing the first minute of performance. Conclusion: The observed increase in
skill ratings with video playback speed replicates findings for laparoscopy in
[2], and extends to real robotic surgeries. Furthermore, the large differences
in skill labels when comparing the first minute of surgery to the entire 15
minute video warrants further investigation into how much perceived skill
ratings vary in time (sub-task level) vs. summative metrics (task level).

spreads. In this work we use deep HST photometry to look for evidence of
abundance variations in the main sequence of a young massive cluster NGC 419

on stars in the same mass range found in old globulars ($\sim0.75-1$
M$_{\odot}$), where light elements variations are detected. We find no evidence
for N abundance variations among these stars in the $Un-B$ and $U-B$ CMD of NGC
419. This is at odds with the N-variations found in old globulars like 47 Tuc,
NGC 6352 and NGC 6637 with similar metallicity to NGC 419. Although the
signature of the abundance variations characteristic of old globulars appears
to be significantly smaller or absent in this young cluster, we cannot conclude
if this effect is mainly driven by its age or its mass.

mortality; however, the impact of burn injury on tissue-specific insulin
sensitivity and its molecular mechanisms with consideration of insulin state
remains unknown in rodent models. This study was designed to characterize a
burn mouse model with tissue-specific insulin resistance under insulin clamp
conditions. C57BL6/J mice were subjected to 30% full-thickness burn injury and
underwent the combination of hyperinsulinemic isoglycemicclamp (HIC) and
positron emission tomography (PET). Hepatic glucose production (HGP) and
peripheral glucose disappearance rate (Rd) were measured at different time
points up to 7 days post injury. Burned mice showed a significant fasting
hypoglycemia and hypoinsulinemia (P < 0.01) on post-burn day (PBD) 3 and 7
along with significantly higher energy expenditure (P < 0.01). HICon PBD 3
demonstrated that burn injury induced systemic insulin resistance, resulting
from a significant decrease in insulin-stimulated Rd (33.0 +/- 10.2 vs 68.3 +/-
5.9 mg/kg/min; P < 0.05). In contrast, HGP of burned and sham mice was
comparable both in the basal and clamp period. PET on PBD 3 showed a lower

quadriceps of burned mice compared with sham-burned mice. Gastrocnemius muscle
harvested from burned mice on PBD 3 showed decreased insulin-stimulated

that impaired insulin-stimulated Rd in skeletal muscle, not elevated HGP, plays
a role in the development of burn-induced insulin resistance in a mouse model.

strategic setting. In this setting, a single supplier allocates
capacity-limited resources to requests that arrive in a sequential and
arbitrary manner. Each request is associated with an agent who may act
selfishly to misreport the requirement and valuation of her request. The
supplier charges payment from agents whose requests are satisfied, but incurs a
load-dependent supply cost. The goal is to design an incentive compatible
online mechanism, which determines not only the resource allocation of each
request, but also the payment of each agent, so as to (approximately) maximize
the social welfare (i.e., aggregate valuations minus supply cost). We study
this problem under the framework of competitive analysis. The major
contribution of this paper is the development of a unified approach that
achieves the best-possible competitive ratios for setups with different supply
costs. Specifically, we show that when there is no supply cost or the supply
cost function is linear, our model is essentially a standard 0-1 knapsack
problem, for which our approach achieves logarithmic competitive ratios that
match the state-of-the-art (which is optimal). For the more challenging setup
when the supply cost is strictly-convex, we provide online mechanisms, for the
first time, that lead to the optimal competitive ratios as well. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first approach that unifies the characterization of
optimal competitive ratios in online resource allocation for different setups
including zero, linear and strictly-convex supply costs.

Kaiser-Bessel transform pair, and estimates on sums over distorted sinc

We warm up with an elementary proof of the above but with half the rate, via a

$e^{ixt}$, we also prove another lower bound $(4/e\pi \alpha)^q$, up to
algebraic prefactors, which is stronger than the above for small $\alpha,

numerically-measured empirical asymptotic rate, uniformly over $(0,1)^2$, and
they become sharp in certain regions. However, our results are not asymptotic:
they apply to essentially all $N$, $p$, and $q$, and with all constants

introducing physical barriers between neighboring plants. Two clustering
processes are distinguished: i) one of cells with the presence of the pathogen,
detected on soil analysis; and ii) that of diseased plants, revealed from a
visual inspection of the plantation. The former is well described by the
standard site-bond percolation. In the latter, the percolation threshold is
fitted by a Tsallis distribution when no barriers are introduced. We provide,
for both cases, the formulae for the minimal barrier density to prevent the
emergence of the spanning cluster. Though this work is focused on a specific
pathogen, the model presented here can also be applied to prevent the spreading
of other pathogens that disseminate, by other means, from one plant to the

Wuhan, China. Since then, the disease has spread worldwide. As it currently
spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and
citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States
healthcare system. They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm
the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and
states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social
distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the
curve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people
hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given
that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we
model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the
theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates.
With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the
peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how
aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the
capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve
impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time
of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical
evidence from China, South Korea, Italy and the United States that supports the
insights from the model.

incorporate this test in structure learning of DAGs that contain both linear

agents has to persistently visit a finite set of targets. Each of these targets
has an internal state that evolves with linear stochastic dynamics. The agents
can observe these states, and the observation quality is a function of the
distance between the agent and a given target. The goal is then to minimize the
mean squared estimation error of these target states. We approach the problem
from an infinite horizon perspective, where we prove that, under some natural
assumptions, the covariance matrix of each target converges to a limit cycle.
The goal, therefore, becomes to minimize the steady state uncertainty. Assuming
that the trajectory is parameterized, we provide tools for computing the steady
state cost gradient. We show that, in one-dimensional (1D) environments with
bounded control and non-overlapping targets, when an optimal control exists it
can be represented using a finite number of parameters. We also propose an
efficient parameterization of the agent trajectories for multidimensional
settings using Fourier curves. Simulation results show the efficacy of the
proposed technique in 1D, 2D and 3D scenarios.

identify the integration constants in order to remove the conical singularity
sitting at the origin. In such a way we obtain a well defined Minkowski limit

sufficient to assume a finite size of the electric charge to obtain a short

(Jaksch et al., 2010) is a popular method to perform regret minimization in
unknown discrete Markov Decision Processes under the average-reward criterion.
Despite its nice and generic theoretical regret guarantees, this strategy and
its variants have remained until now mostly theoretical as numerical
experiments on simple environments exhibit long burn-in phases before the
learning takes place. Motivated by practical efficiency, we present UCRL3,
following the lines of UCRL2, but with two key modifications: First, it uses
state-of-the-art time-uniform concentration inequalities, to compute confidence
sets on the reward and transition distributions for each state-action pair. To
further tighten exploration, we introduce an adaptive computation of the
support of each transition distributions. This enables to revisit the extended
value iteration procedure to optimize over distributions with reduced support
by disregarding low probability transitions, while still ensuring
near-optimism. We demonstrate, through numerical experiments on standard
environments, that reducing exploration this way yields a substantial numerical
improvement compared to UCRL2 and its variants. On the theoretical side, these
key modifications enable to derive a regret bound for UCRL3 improving on UCRL2,
that for the first time makes appear a notion of local diameter and effective
support, thanks to variance-aware concentration bounds.

  Theories. A Review","  GR and other metric theories of gravity are formulated with an arbitrary
auxiliary curved background in a Lagrangian formalism. A new sketch of how to
include spinor fields is included. Conserved quantities are obtained using
Noether's theorem and expressed as divergences of antisymmetric densities,
connecting local perturbations with quasi-local conserved quantities. The
background's arbitrariness matches the so-called non-localizability of
gravitational energy (infinity of localizations). The formalism has two partly
overlapping uses: practical applications of pure GR (with fictitious
background) and foundational considerations in which background causality
facilitates quantization. The Schwarzschild solution is a primary application.
Various possibilities for calculating the mass using surface integration are
given. A field-theoretic curved spacetime is given from spatial infinity to the
horizon and even to the true singularity. Trajectories of test particles in the
Schwarzschild geometry are gauge-dependent in that even breakdowns at the
horizon can be suppressed (or generated) by naive gauge transformations. This
fact illustrates the auxiliary nature of the background metric and the need for
some notion of maximal extension---much as with coordinate transformations in
geometric GR. A continuous collapse to a point mass in the field-theoretic
framework is given. The field-theoretic method is generalized to arbitrary
metric theories in $D$ dimensions. The results are developed in the framework
of Lovelock gravity and applied to calculate masses of Schwarzschild-like black
holes. The bimetric formalism makes it natural to consider a graviton mass.
Babak and Grishchuk's numerical and hence nonperturbative work sheds light on
questions of a (dis)continuous massless limit for massive pure spin-2 and the
classical (in)stability of spin-2/spin-0 theory.

performance on several semi-supervised benchmark datasets. MT maintains a
teacher model's weights as the exponential moving average of a student model's
weights and minimizes the divergence between their probability predictions
under diverse perturbations of the inputs. However, MT is known to suffer from
confirmation bias, that is, reinforcing incorrect teacher model predictions. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective method called Local Clustering
(LC) to mitigate the effect of confirmation bias. In MT, each data point is
considered independent of other points during training; however, data points
are likely to be close to each other in feature space if they share similar
features. Motivated by this, we cluster data points locally by minimizing the
pairwise distance between neighboring data points in feature space. Combined
with a standard classification cross-entropy objective on labeled data points,
the misclassified unlabeled data points are pulled towards high-density regions
of their correct class with the help of their neighbors, thus improving model
performance. We demonstrate on semi-supervised benchmark datasets SVHN and
CIFAR-10 that adding our LC loss to MT yields significant improvements compared
to MT and performance comparable to the state of the art in semi-supervised
learning.

  Slide Images","  The rapidly emerging field of computational pathology has the potential to
enable objective diagnosis, therapeutic response prediction and identification
of new morphological features of clinical relevance. However, deep
learning-based computational pathology approaches either require manual
annotation of gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) in fully-supervised settings
or thousands of WSIs with slide-level labels in a weakly-supervised setting.
Moreover, whole slide level computational pathology methods also suffer from
domain adaptation and interpretability issues. These challenges have prevented
the broad adaptation of computational pathology for clinical and research
purposes. Here we present CLAM - Clustering-constrained attention multiple
instance learning, an easy-to-use, high-throughput, and interpretable WSI-level
processing and learning method that only requires slide-level labels while
being data efficient, adaptable and capable of handling multi-class subtyping
problems. CLAM is a deep-learning-based weakly-supervised method that uses
attention-based learning to automatically identify sub-regions of high
diagnostic value in order to accurately classify the whole slide, while also
utilizing instance-level clustering over the representative regions identified
to constrain and refine the feature space. In three separate analyses, we
demonstrate the data efficiency and adaptability of CLAM and its superior
performance over standard weakly-supervised classification. We demonstrate that
CLAM models are interpretable and can be used to identify well-known and new
morphological features. We further show that models trained using CLAM are
adaptable to independent test cohorts, cell phone microscopy images, and
biopsies. CLAM is a general-purpose and adaptable method that can be used for a
variety of different computational pathology tasks in both clinical and
research settings.

reliable model parameters. Uncertainty quantification and optimal experimental

in sub-optimal experimental designs and consequently, less-informative data,

proposed method avoids the simplifying assumption of output-parameter

information matrix-based experimental design strategies. Thus, the optimized
current input profile results in experimental data of higher information
content and in turn, in more precise parameter estimates.

LRCN-RetailNet: a recurrent neural network architecture capable of learning a

videos captured by low-cost surveillance cameras. The input video format
follows the recently proposed RGBP image format, which is comprised of color

two relevant aspects: spatial features extracted through convolutional layers
from the RGBP images; and the temporal coherence of the problem, which is
exploited by recurrent layers. We show that, through a supervised learning
approach, the trained models are capable of predicting the people count with
high accuracy. Additionally, we present and demonstrate that a straightforward
modification of the methodology is effective to exclude salespeople from the

and compare the proposed architecture. Results corroborated that LRCN-RetailNet
remarkably outperforms both the previous RetailNet architecture, which was

property of quantum information to copy-protect programs and was first put
forward by \cite{aaronson2009quantum}. The general goal is that a program
distributor can distribute a quantum state $|\Psi\rangle$, whose classical
description is secret to the users; a user can use this state to run the
program P on his own input, but not be able to pirate this program P or create
another state with the same functionality. In the copy-protection with oracle
setting, the user has access to a public oracle and can use the given quantum
state and the oracle to compute on his/her own input for polynomially many
times. However, the user is not able to produce an additional program(quantum
or classical) that computes the same as P on almost all inputs.
  We present a first quantum copy protection scheme with a classical oracle for
any unlearnable function families. The construction is based on membership
oracles for hidden subspaces in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$, an idea derived from the
public key quantum money scheme in \cite{aaronson2012quantum}. We prove the
security of the scheme relative to a classical oracle, namely, the subspace
membership oracle with the functionality of computing the secret function we
want to copy-protect. The security proof builds on the quantum lower bound for
the Direct-Product problem (\cite{aaronson2012quantum,ben2016quantum}) and the
quantum unlearnability of the copy-protected functions.
  We also show that existence of quantum copy protection and the quantum
hardness of Learning-with-Errors (LWE) will imply publicly verifiable quantum
money.

connectivity data to locate users to semantic indoor locations such as floors,
regions, rooms, etc. WiFi connectivity data consists of sporadic connections
between devices and nearby WiFi access points (APs), each of which may cover a
relatively large area within a building. Our system, entitled semantic LOCATion
cleanER (LOCATER), postulates semantic localization as a series of data
cleaning challenges - first, it treats the problem of determining the AP to
which a device is connected between any two of its connection events as a
missing value detection and repair problem. This allows the device to be
localized to the region covered by the AP. It then associates the device with
the semantic subregion (e.g., a conference room in the region) by postulating
it as a location disambiguation problem, akin to the entity resolution
challenge studied in database literature. We propose a bootstrapping
semi-supervised learning method for the coarse localization and
graph-based/rule-based methods to achieve finer localization. We show that
LOCATER can achieve significantly high accuracy at both the coarse and fine
levels. LOCATER offers several benefits over traditional indoor localization
approaches since it neither requires active cooperation from users (e.g.,
downloading code on a mobile device and communicating with the server) nor
installing external hardware (e.g., network monitors).

motivates us to model the correlation among feature channels, which implicitly

appearing in the mass renormalization of the scalar fields must inherit
corrections arising out of gravitational interactions. In this work we have
explicitly demonstrated that there are no such corrections of gravitational
origin to the quadratic divergences in the mass counter terms. This statement
holds true irrespective of the nature of the gravitational interaction, i.e.,
whether gravity is described by general relativity or f(R) theory.
Interestingly, it also turns out that the one loop effective action of
scalar-coupled-gravity system will be well-behaved \emph{if and only if} the
$f(R)$ theory is free from ghosts. In particular, the results derived in the
context of f(R) theory are shown to be in exact agreement with the
corresponding results derived from the equivalent scalar-tensor representation.
Our analysis suggests the tantalizing possibility that the masses of the scalar
fields can be consistently kept smaller than some Ultra Violet (UV) cutoff
scale and is independent of the nature of the gravity theory, which may involve
higher curvature corrections. All these will be true provided the matter fields
and the gravity theory can be embedded consistently into a UV complete theory
at the Planck scale.

  Training for Few-shot Skin Disease Classification","  Skin disease classification from images is crucial to dermatological
diagnosis. However, identifying skin lesions involves a variety of aspects in
terms of size, color, shape, and texture. To make matters worse, many
categories only contain very few samples, posing great challenges to
conventional machine learning algorithms and even human experts. Inspired by
the recent success of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) in natural image classification,
we propose to apply FSL to skin disease identification to address the extreme
scarcity of training sample problem. However, directly applying FSL to this
task does not work well in practice, and we find that the problem can be
largely attributed to the incompatibility between Cross Entropy (CE) and
episode training, which are both commonly used in FSL. Based on a detailed
analysis, we propose the Query-Relative (QR) loss, which proves superior to CE
under episode training and is closely related to recently proposed mutual
information estimation. Moreover, we further strengthen the proposed QR loss
with a novel adaptive hard margin strategy. Comprehensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of the proposed FSL scheme and the possibility to diagnosis
rare skin disease with a few labeled samples.

source map is a local homeomorphisms---and complete pseudogroups---which are
inverse monoids equipped with a particularly nice representation on a

  Our generalisation improves on the existing functorial correspondence in four
ways. Firstly, we enlarge the classes of maps appearing to each side. Secondly,
we generalise on one side from inverse monoids to inverse categories, and on
the other side, from \'etale groupoids to what we call partite \'etale
groupoids. Thirdly, we generalise from \'etale groupoids to source-\'etale
categories, and on the other side, from inverse monoids to restriction monoids.
Fourthly, and most far-reachingly, we generalise from topological \'etale
groupoids to \'etale groupoids internal to any join restriction category C with
local glueings; and on the other side, from complete pseudogroups to ``complete
C-pseudogroups'', i.e., inverse monoids with a nice representation on an object
of C. Taken together, our results yield an equivalence, for a join restriction
category C with local glueings, between join restriction categories with a
well-behaved functor to C, and partite source-\'etale internal categories in C.
In fact, we obtain this by cutting down a larger adjunction between arbitrary
restriction categories over C, and partite internal categories in C.
  Beyond proving this main result, numerous applications are given, which
reconstruct and extend existing correspondences in the literature, and provide
general formulations of completion processes.

  Marketing","  User marketing is a key focus of consumer-based internet companies. Learning
algorithms are effective to optimize marketing campaigns which increase user
engagement, and facilitates cross-marketing to related products. By attracting
users with rewards, marketing methods are effective to boost user activity in
the desired products. Rewards incur significant cost that can be off-set by
increase in future revenue. Most methodologies rely on churn predictions to
prevent losing users to make marketing decisions, which cannot capture up-lift
across counterfactual outcomes with business metrics. Other predictive models
are capable of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, but fail to capture
the balance of cost versus benefit. We propose a treatment effect optimization
methodology for user marketing. This algorithm learns from past experiments and
utilizes novel optimization methods to optimize cost efficiency with respect to
user selection. The method optimizes decisions using deep learning optimization
models to treat and reward users, which is effective in producing
cost-effective, impactful marketing campaigns. Our methodology demonstrates
superior algorithmic flexibility with integration with deep learning methods
and dealing with business constraints. The effectiveness of our model surpasses
the quasi-oracle estimation (R-learner) model and causal forests. We also
established evaluation metrics that reflect the cost-efficiency and real-world
business value. Our proposed constrained and direct optimization algorithms
outperform by 24.6% compared with the best performing method in prior art and
baseline methods. The methodology is useful in many product scenarios such as
optimal treatment allocation and it has been deployed in production world-wide.

methods are unable to capture continuous space treatment policies with a
measure of intensity. They also lack the capacity to consider the complexity of
treatment such as matching candidate treatments with the subject. We propose to
formulate the effectiveness of treatment as a parametrizable model, expanding
to a multitude of treatment intensities and complexities through the continuous
policy treatment function, and the likelihood of matching. Our proposal to
decompose treatment effect functions into effectiveness factors presents a

  New Framework","  Recent applications of autonomous agents and robots, for example,
self-driving cars, scenario-based trainers, exploration robots, service robots,
have brought attention to crucial trust-related problems associated with the
current generation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. AI systems
particularly dominated by the connectionist deep learning neural network
approach lack capabilities of explaining their decisions and actions to others,
despite their great successes. They are fundamentally non-intuitive black
boxes, which renders their decision or actions opaque, making it difficult to
trust them in safety-critical applications. The recent stance on the
explainability of AI systems has witnessed several works on eXplainable
Artificial Intelligence; however, most of the studies have focused on
data-driven XAI systems applied in computational sciences. Studies addressing
the increasingly pervasive goal-driven agents and robots are still missing.
This paper reviews works on explainable goal-driven intelligent agents and
robots, focusing on techniques for explaining and communicating agents
perceptual functions (for example, senses, vision, etc.) and cognitive
reasoning (for example, beliefs, desires, intention, plans, and goals) with
humans in the loop. The review highlights key strategies that emphasize
transparency and understandability, and continual learning for explainability.
Finally, the paper presents requirements for explainability and suggests a
roadmap for the possible realization of effective goal-driven explainable
agents and robots

  and variants: a restricted class of Bernoulli mixture models","  Statistical network analysis primarily focuses on inferring the parameters of
an observed network. In many applications, especially in the social sciences,
the observed data is the groups formed by individual subjects. In these
applications, the network is itself a parameter of a statistical model. Zhao
and Weko (2019) propose a model-based approach, called the hub model, to infer
implicit networks from grouping behavior. The hub model assumes that each
member of the group is brought together by a member of the group called the
hub. The hub model belongs to the family of Bernoulli mixture models.
Identifiability of parameters is a notoriously difficult problem for Bernoulli
mixture models. This paper proves identifiability of the hub model parameters
and estimation consistency under mild conditions. Furthermore, this paper
generalizes the hub model by introducing a model component that allows hubless
groups in which individual nodes spontaneously appear independent of any other
individual. We refer to this additional component as the null component. The
new model bridges the gap between the hub model and the degenerate case of the
mixture model -- the Bernoulli product. Identifiability and consistency are
also proved for the new model. Numerical studies are provided to demonstrate
the theoretical results.

cryptographic primitives, and weaknesses in protocols using both, can all lead
to exploitable vulnerabilities in software. Manually fixing such issues is
challenging and resource consuming, especially when maintaining legacy software
that contains broken or outdated cryptography, and for which source code may
not be available. While there is existing work on identifying cryptographic
primitives (often in the context of malware analysis), none of this prior work
has focused on replacing such primitives with stronger (or more secure ones)
after they have been identified. This paper explores feasibility of designing
and implementing a toolchain for Augmentation and Legacy-software
Instrumentation of Cryptographic Executables (ALICE). The key features of ALICE
are: (i) automatically detecting and extracting implementations of weak or
broken cryptographic primitives from binaries without requiring source code or
debugging symbols, (ii) identifying the context and scope in which such
primitives are used, and performing program analysis to determine the effects
of replacing such implementations with more secure ones, and (iii) replacing
implementations of weak primitives with those of stronger or more secure ones.
We demonstrate practical feasibility of our approach on cryptographic hash
functions with several popular cryptographic libraries and real-world programs
of various levels of complexity. Our experimental results show that ALICE can
locate and replace insecure hash functions, even in large binaries (we tested
ones of size up to 1.5MB), while preserving existing functionality of the
original binaries, and while incurring minimal execution-time overhead in the
rewritten binaries. We also open source ALICE's code at

  Approach with Novel Pilot Design","  This paper studies the massive machine-type communications (mMTC) for the
future Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where a large number of IoT
devices exist in the network and a random subset of them become active at each
time instant. Building upon the fact that the covariance matrix of the received
signal can be accurately estimated in the spatial domain if the base station
(BS) is equipped with a massive number of antennas, we propose a
covariance-based device activity detection and channel estimation strategy in a
massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) aided mMTC system. For this
strategy, a novel approach for the pilot sequence design is first provided,
where the pilot of each device is merely determined by a unique phase
parameter. Then, by estimating the phase parameters of the active pilot
sequences that contribute to the received covariance matrix, an efficient
algorithm is proposed to detect the active devices without the prior
information about the total number of active devices. At last, given the
estimation of active devices, channel estimation is conducted based on the
conventional minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) approach. It is worth noting
that our proposed strategy is able to obtain all the results in closed-forms,
and is thus of much lower complexity compared to the existing strategies that
are based on iterative algorithms for device detection and channel estimation.

  for Gamma-Ray Burst progenitors with the IllustrisTNG simulation","  The rate of long-duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) has been identified as a
potential proxy for the star formation rate (SFR) across redshift, but the
exact relationship depends on GRB progenitor models (single versus binary). The
single-progenitor collapsar model accounts for the preference towards
low-metallicity GRB progenitors, but is in apparent tension with some
high-metallicity GRB host galaxy measurements. As a possible solution, we
consider the scenario where high-metallicity GRB hosts harbour low metallicity
regions in which GRB progenitors form. For this, we use the IllustrisTNG
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to investigate the internal metallicity
distribution of GRB hosts, implementing in post-processing different GRB
formation models. Predictions (GRB rate, host metallicities and stellar masses)
are compared to the high-completeness GRB legacy surveys BAT6 and SHOALS and a
sample of high-redshift GRB-DLA metallicities, allowing us to compute their
relative likelihoods. When the internal metallicity distribution of galaxies is
ignored, the best-fitting model requires a metallicity-independent channel, as
previously proposed by Trenti, Perna & Jimenez. However, when the internal
metallicity distribution is considered, a basic metallicity bias model with a
cutoff at $Z_{max}=0.35Z_\odot$ is the best fitting one. Current data are
insufficient to discriminate among more detailed metallicity bias models, such
as weak metallicity dependence of massive binaries vs stronger metallicity bias
of collapsars. An increased sample of objects, and direct measurements of host
stellar masses at redshift $z>2$ would allow to further constrain the origin of
long GRBs.

  A New Data Driven Tool for Spatiotemporal Tipping Point","  In this paper, we introduce a new tool for data-driven discovery of early
warning signs of critical transitions in ice shelves, from remote sensing data.
Our approach adopts principles of directed spectral clustering methodology
considering an asymmetric affinity matrix and the associated directed graph
Laplacian. We applied our approach generally to both reprocessed the ice
velocity data, and also remote sensing satellite images of the Larsen C ice
shelf. Our results allow us to (post-cast) predict fault lines responsible for
the critical transitions leading to the break up of the Larsen C ice shelf
crack, which resulted in the A68 iceberg, and we are able to do so, months
earlier before the actual occurrence, and also much earlier than any other
previously available methodology, in particular those based on interferometry.

  Projects","  International stakeholders increasingly invest in offsetting carbon
emissions, for example, via issuing Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to
forest conservation projects. Issuing trusted payments requires a transparent
monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) process of the ecosystem services
(e.g., carbon stored in forests). The current MRV process, however, is either
too expensive (on-ground inspection of forest) or inaccurate (satellite).
Recent works propose low-cost and accurate MRV via automatically determining
forest carbon from drone imagery, collected by the landowners. The automation
of MRV, however, opens up the possibility that landowners report untruthful
drone imagery. To be robust against untruthful reporting, we propose
TrueBranch, a metric learning-based algorithm that verifies the truthfulness of
drone imagery from forest conservation projects. TrueBranch aims to detect
untruthfully reported drone imagery by matching it with public satellite
imagery. Preliminary results suggest that nominal distance metrics are not
sufficient to reliably detect untruthfully reported imagery. TrueBranch
leverages metric learning to create a feature embedding in which truthfully and
untruthfully collected imagery is easily distinguishable by distance
thresholding.

  turbulence laden with adhesive particles","  We carry out direct numerical simulation combined with adhesive discrete
element calculations to investigate collision-induced breakage of agglomerates
in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Based on extensive simulation runs, an
adhesion parameter Adn is constructed to quantify the possibility of occurrence
of sticking, rebound, and breakage events. The collision-induced breakage rate
is then formulated based on the Smoluchowski equation and a breakage fraction.
The breakage fraction, defined as the fraction of collisions that result in
breakage, is then analytically estimated by a convolution of the probability
distribution of collision velocity and a universal transfer function. It is
shown that the breakage rate decreases exponentially as the adhesion parameter
Adn increases for doublets and scales as linear functions of the agglomerate
size, with the slope controlled by Adn. These results allow one to estimate the
breakage rate for early-stage agglomerates of arbitrary size. Moreover, the
role of the flow structure on the collision-induced breakage is also examined.
Violent collisions and breakages are more likely caused by particles ejected
rapidly from strong vortices and happen in straining sheets. Our results extend
the findings of shear-induced fragmentation, forming a more complete picture of
breakage of agglomerates in turbulent flows.

neutron distributions are presented. First, the available experimental proton
distributions are used as a constraint rather than inferred from the
calculation. Second, the recently proposed distribution formula, d3pF, is used
for the neutron density, which is more detailed than the usual shapes, for the
first time in nuclear structure calculation. A semi-microscopic approach for
binding energy calculation is considered in this study, however, the proposed
improvements can be introduced to any other approach. The ground state binding
energy and neutron density distribution of $^{208}$Pb nucleus are calculated by
optimizing the binding energy considering three different distribution
formulae. The implementation of the proposed improvements leads to a
qualitative and quantitative improvement in the calculation of the binding
energy and neutron density distribution. The calculated binding energy agrees
with the experimental value, and the calculated neutron density shows
fluctuations within the nuclear interior, which agrees with the predictions of
self-consistent approaches.

resulting in finite conduction band population. Such a redistribution of
electrons results in the generation of current which can be manipulated by the
angle of incidence of the pulse. For the normal incidence, the current along a
direction transverse to the polarization of the optical pulse is zero. However,
the interlayer symmetry is broken up by a finite angle of incidence which
causes induction of electric current in the direction perpendicular to the

be manipulated by tuning the angle of incidence of the laser pulse. Further,
the symmetry of the system prohibits the generation of transverse current if

the small in-domain supervised data scale of fine-tuning, the two-stage models
typically cannot capture the domain-specific and task-specific language
patterns well. In this paper, we propose a selective masking task-guided
pre-training method and add it between the general pre-training and
fine-tuning. In this stage, we train the masked language modeling task on
in-domain unsupervised data, which enables our model to effectively learn the
domain-specific language patterns. To efficiently learn the task-specific
language patterns, we adopt a selective masking strategy instead of the
conventional random masking, which means we only mask the tokens that are
important to the downstream task. Specifically, we define the importance of
tokens as their impacts on the final classification results and use a neural
model to learn the implicit selecting rules. Experimental results on two
sentiment analysis tasks show that our method can achieve comparable or even
better performance with less than 50\% overall computation cost, which
indicates our method is both effective and efficient. The source code will be

consisting of an encoder, which compresses an input vector of dimension $D$ to
a vector of low dimension $d$, and a decoder which transforms the
low-dimensional vector back to the original input vector (or one that is very
similar). In this paper we explore the compressive power of autoencoders that
are Boolean threshold networks by studying the numbers of nodes and layers that
are required to ensure that the numbers of nodes and layers that are required
to ensure that each vector in a given set of distinct input binary vectors is
transformed back to its original. We show that for any set of $n$ distinct
vectors there exists a seven-layer autoencoder with the smallest possible
middle layer, (i.e., its size is logarithmic in $n$), but that there is a set
of $n$ vectors for which there is no three-layer autoencoder with a middle
layer of the same size. In addition we present a kind of trade-off: if a
considerably larger middle layer is permissible then a five-layer autoencoder
does exist. We also study encoding by itself. The results we obtain suggest
that it is the decoding that constitutes the bottleneck of autoencoding. For
example, there always is a three-layer Boolean threshold encoder that
compresses $n$ vectors into a dimension that is reduced to twice the logarithm
of $n$.

with $s \geq 0$; that is, we show that, for any pair of Borel sets $A,B \subset

linear quivers) and the associated mirror dualities have a particularly simple
realization in terms of a Type IIB system of D3-D5-NS5-branes. In this paper,
we present a systematic field theory prescription for constructing 3d mirror
pairs beyond the $ADE$ quiver gauge theories, starting from a dual pair of
$A$-type quivers with unitary gauge groups. The construction involves a certain
generalization of the $S$ and the $T$ operations, which arise in the context of

We implement this construction in terms of two supersymmetric observables --
the round sphere partition function and the superconformal index on $S^2 \times
S^1$. We discuss explicit examples of various (non-$ADE$) infinite families of
mirror pairs that can be obtained in this fashion. In addition, we use the

  Reviews in Software Engineering","  Context: When conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), researchers
usually face the challenge of designing a search strategy that appropriately
balances result quality and review effort. Using digital library (or database)
searches or snowballing alone may not be enough to achieve high-quality
results. On the other hand, using both digital library searches and snowballing
together may increase the overall review effort.
  Objective: The goal of this research is to propose and evaluate hybrid search
strategies that selectively combine database searches with snowballing.
  Method: We propose four hybrid search strategies combining database searches
in digital libraries with iterative, parallel, or sequential backward and
forward snowballing. We simulated the strategies over three existing SLRs in SE
that adopted both database searches and snowballing. We compared the outcome of
digital library searches, snowballing, and hybrid strategies using precision,
recall, and F-measure to investigate the performance of each strategy.
  Results: Our results show that, for the analyzed SLRs, combining database
searches from the Scopus digital library with parallel or sequential
snowballing achieved the most appropriate balance of precision and recall.
  Conclusion: We put forward that, depending on the goals of the SLR and the
available resources, using a hybrid search strategy involving a representative
digital library and parallel or sequential snowballing tends to represent an
appropriate alternative to be used when searching for evidence in SLRs.

effect is quantum by nature because of its deep connection with the Berry
curvature dipole. However, a full quantum description is still absent. Here we
construct the quantum theory of the nonlinear Hall effect by using the
diagrammatic techniques. We figure out totally 100 diagrams in 9 types that
contribute to the leading nonlinear response in the weak-disorder limit. We
show both qualitative and quantitative differences between the quantum theory
and the semiclassical Boltzmann formulism. As an application of the
diagrammatic results, we propose an experimental scheme to realize a pure
electric detection of the Berry curvature distribution near the band edge. This
work will be instructive for experimental and theoretical explorations of the
topological physics beyond the linear regime.

  flagellated bacteria motility","  The behavior of flagellated bacteria swimming in non-Newtonian media remains
an area with contradictory and conflicting results. We report on the behavior
of wild-type and smooth-swimming E. coli in Newtonian, shear thinning and
viscoelastic media, measuring their trajectories and swimming speed using a
three dimensional real-time tracking microscope. We conclude that the speed
enhancement in Methocel solution at higher concentration is due to
shear-thinning and an analytical model is used to support our experimental
result. We argue that shear-induced normal stresses reduce the wobbling
behavior during cell swimming but do not significantly affect swimming speed.
However, the normal stresses play an important role in decreasing the flagellar
bundling time which changes the swimming speed distribution. A dimensionless
number, the ""Strangulation number"" (Str) is proposed and used to characterize
this effect.

dense full-azimuth sampling. Unfortunately, the costs of acquiring densely
sampled data rapidly become prohibitive and we need to look for ways to
sparsely collect data, e.g. from sparsely distributed ocean bottom nodes, from
which we then derive densely sampled surveys through the method of wavefield
reconstruction. Because of their relatively cheap and simple calculations,
wavefield reconstruction via matrix factorizations has proven to be a viable
and scalable alternative to the more generally used transform-based methods.
While this method is capable of processing all full azimuth data frequency by
frequency slice, its performance degrades at higher frequencies because
monochromatic data at these frequencies is not as well approximated by low-rank
factorizations. We address this problem by proposing a recursive recovery
technique, which involves weighted matrix factorizations where recovered
wavefields at the lower frequencies serve as prior information for the recovery
of the higher frequencies. To limit the adverse effects of potential
overfitting, we propose a limited-subspace recursively weighted matrix
factorization approach where the size of the row and column subspaces to
construct the weight matrices is constrained. We apply our method to data
collected from the Gulf of Suez, and our results show that our limited-subspace
weighted recovery method significantly improves the recovery quality.

data for political purposes. It has raised questions regarding the ways and the
extent to which data can be used to create psychographical profiles to
determine what kind of advertisement would be most effective to persuade a
particular person in a particular location for some political event. In this
work, we study the political ads dataset collected by ProPublica, an American
nonprofit newsroom, using a network of volunteers in the period before the 2018
US midterm elections. We first describe the main characteristics of the data
and explore the user attributes including age, region, activity, and more, with
a series of interactive illustrations. Furthermore, an important first step
towards understating of political manipulation via user targeting is to
identify politically related ads, yet manually checking ads is not feasible due
to the scale of social media advertising. Consequently, we address the
challenge of automatically classifying between political and non-political ads,
demonstrating a significant improvement compared to the current text-based
classifier used by ProPublica, and study whether the user targeting attributes
are beneficial for this task. Our evaluation sheds light on questions, such as
how user attributes are being used for political ads targeting and which users
are more prone to be targeted with political ads. Overall, our contribution of
data exploration, political ad classification and initial analysis of the
targeting attributes, is designed to support future work with the ProPublica
dataset, and specifically with regard to the understanding of political

  without Conditioning on Signs","  In the past few years, Selective Inference (SI) has been actively studied for
inference on the features of linear models that are adaptively selected by
feature selection methods. A seminal work is proposed by Lee et al. (2016) in
the case of the Lasso. The basic idea of SI is to make inference conditional on
the selection event. In Lee et al. (2016), the authors proposed a tractable way
to conduct inference conditional on the selected features and their signs.
Unfortunately, additionally conditioning on the signs leads to low statistical
power because of over-conditioning. To improve the power, a current available
possible solution is to remove the conditioning on signs by considering the
union of an exponentially large number of all possible sign vectors, which
leads to an unrealistically large amount of computational cost unless the
number of selected features is sufficiently small. To address this problem, we
propose an efficient method to characterize the selection event without
conditioning on signs by using parametric programming. The main idea is to
compute the continuum path of Lasso solutions in the direction of a test
statistic, and identify the subset of data space corresponding to the feature
selection event by following the solution path. We conduct several experiments
to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.

laborious, time-consuming and complicated manual process that is in short
supply. Deep learning based computer-aided screening, e.g., infection
segmentation, is thus viewed as an alternative due to its great successes in
medical imaging. However, the publicly available COVID-19 training data are
limited, which would easily cause overfitting of traditional deep learning
methods that are usually data-hungry with millions of parameters. On the other
hand, fast training/testing and low computational cost are also important for
quick deployment and development of computer-aided COVID-19 screening systems,
but traditional deep learning methods, especially for image segmentation, are
usually computationally intensive. To address the above problems, we propose
MiniSeg, a lightweight deep learning model for efficient COVID-19 segmentation.
Compared with traditional segmentation methods, MiniSeg has several significant
strengths: i) it only has 472K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii)
it has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical
deployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private
COVID-19 data for further improving performance. In addition, we build a
comprehensive COVID-19 segmentation benchmark for comparing MiniSeg with
traditional methods. Code and models will be released to promote the research
and practical deployment for computer-aided COVID-19 screening.

severe liver damage or cancer. Over the past two decades a large number of
dynamic models have been presented based on experimental data to predict the
HBV infection behavior. Besides, several kinds of controllers have been
employed to obtain effective solutions from the HBV treatment. In this essay we
consider the nonlinear HBV dynamic model which subjected to both parametric and
non-parametric uncertainties without using any linearization. In previous
control methods three HBV dynamic states should be measured virus safe, and
infected cells. However in most of the biological systems, the amount of virus
is experimentally measured. Accordingly, the necessity to seek a method that
can estimate the amount of required drug by receiving the virus data emerges.
An ANFIS method is developed in this work to provide an intelligent controller
for the drug dosage based on the number of viruses together with an estimator
for the amount of infected and uninfected cells. This controller is trained
first using the data provided from a previous adaptive control strategy. After
that to improve the closed-loop system capabilities two unmeasured state
variables of fundamental dynamics are estimated through the training phase of
the ANFIS observer. The results of simulations demonstrated that the accuracy
of the proposed intelligent controller is high in the tracking of the desired

excellent platform to study 2D flows. Here we study the spatiotemporal film
thickness dynamics of bubbles subjected to evaporation driven Marangoni flows.
Initially, we demonstrate how bubble stability can be dramatically tuned with
the help of evaporation driven flows. Subsequently, we reveal that the spatial
symmetry of thickness profiles evolves non-monotonically with the volatile
species concentration, with profiles being axisymmetric at the two extremes in
concentration. At $50\%$ concentration, spatial symmetry breaks down and
thickness fluctuations are chaotic everywhere in space, with the fluctuation
statistics becoming spatially invariant and ergodic. For these cases, the power
spectrum of thickness fluctuations follow the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ scaling - a
first such demonstration for forcing by evaporation. These results along with
the reported setup provide an excellent framework to further investigate 2D
chaotic flows.

obtained using relativistic mean field theory of nuclear force, QHD-I in
particular. The narrow range of cubic and quartic couplings $\kappa$ and
$\lambda$ allows to obtain both very stiff and very soft equations of state,
including the equations of state of physical interest with incompessibility
K$_{0}$=240-260 MeV. The values of couplings $g_{v}$, $g_{s}$ are lower than

of the rest mass of pseudoscalar particle from physical value $m_{\pi}$=135 MeV
to $m_{X}$=17 MeV is equivalent to reduction of the quark mass from dynamical
value around 310 MeV down to current quark mass around 5 MeV ($\frac{m_{X}^2}
{m_{q,curr}} \simeq \frac{m_{\pi}^2} {m_{q,dyn}}$). Results from both
relativistic mean field theory of nuclear force and from instanton liquid model
thus point towards apparent restoration of chiral symmetry in nucleon-nucleon

  with Non-Ideal Hardware","  Large reflecting surface (LRS) has emerged as a new solution to improve the
energy and spectrum efficiency of wireless communication system. Most existing
studies were conducted with an assumption of ideal hardware, and the impact of
hardware impairments receives little attention. However, the non-negligible
hardware impairments should be taken into consideration when we evaluate the
system performance. In this paper, we consider an LRS assisted communication
system with hardware impairments, and focus on the channel estimation study and
the power scaling law analysis. First, with linear minimum mean square error
estimation, we theoretically characterize the relationship between channel
estimation performance and impairment level, number of reflecting elements, and
pilot power. After that, we analyze the power scaling law and reveal that if
the base station (BS) has perfect channel state information, the transmit power
of user can be made inversely proportional to the number of BS antennas and the
square of the number of reflecting elements with no reduction in performance;
If the BS has imperfectly estimated channel state information, to achieve the
same performance, the transmit power of user can be made inversely proportional
to the square-root of the number of BS antennas and the square of the number of
reflecting elements.

bounded below is Gromov-Hausdorff close to a (lower dimensional) manifold with
bounded geometry, and has the difference of their first Betti numbers equal to

generation, however, there are two long-standing problems: information
under-representation and posterior collapse. The former arises from the fact
that only the last hidden state from the encoder is transformed to the latent
space, which is insufficient to summarize data. The latter comes as a result of
the imbalanced scale between the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence in
the objective function. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose the
discrete variational attention model with categorical distribution over the
attention mechanism owing to the discrete nature in languages. Our approach is
combined with an auto-regressive prior to capture the sequential dependency
from observations, which can enhance the latent space for language generation.
Moreover, thanks to the property of discreteness, the training of our proposed
approach does not suffer from posterior collapse. Furthermore, we carefully
analyze the superiority of discrete latent space over the continuous space with
the common Gaussian distribution. Extensive experiments on language generation
demonstrate superior advantages of our proposed approach in comparison with the
state-of-the-art counterparts.

measurement as an instantaneous collapse. In reality however, no physical
process can occur over a truly infinitesimal time interval. A more subtle
investigation of open quantum systems lead to the theory of continuous
measurement and quantum trajectories, in which wave function collapse occurs
over a finite time scale associated with an interaction. Within this formalism,
it becomes possible to ask many new questions that would be trivial or even
ill-defined in the context of the more basic measurement model. In this thesis,
we investigate both theoretically and experimentally what fundamentally new
capabilities arise when an experimental apparatus can resolve the continuous
dynamics of a measurement. Theoretically, we show that when one can perform
feedback operations on the timescale of the measurement process, the resulting
tools provide significantly more control over entanglement generation, and in
some settings can generate it optimally. We derive these results using a novel
formalism which encompasses most known quantum feedback protocols.
Experimentally, we show that continuous measurement allows one to observe the
dynamics of a system undergoing simultaneous non-commuting measurements, which
provides a reinterpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Finally,
we combine the theoretical focus on quantum feedback with the experimental
capabilities of superconducting circuits to implement a feedback controlled
quantum amplifier. The resulting system is capable of adaptive measurement,
which we use to perform the first canonical phase measurement.

absorption lines in stellar spectra, varying during the activity cycle. This
also influences the information that we derive through spectroscopic analysis.
In this study we analyse high-resolution spectra of 211 Sun-like stars observed
at different phases of their activity cycles, in order to investigate how
stellar activity affects the spectroscopic determination of stellar parameters
and chemical abundances. We observe that equivalent widths of lines can
increase as a function of the activity index log R$^\prime_{\rm HK}$ during the
stellar cycle, which also produces an artificial growth of the stellar
microturbulence and a decrease in effective temperature and metallicity. This
effect is visible for stars with activity indexes log R$^\prime_{\rm
HK}$$\geq$$-$5.0 (i.e., younger than 4-5 Gyr) and it is more significant at
higher activity levels. These results have fundamental implications on several
topics in astrophysics that are discussed in the paper, including stellar
nucleosynthesis, chemical tagging, the study of Galactic chemical evolution,
chemically anomalous stars, the structure of the Milky Way disk, stellar
formation rates, photoevaporation of circumstellar disks, and planet hunting.

implies the existence of a $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}$ bound state with a binding energy

PDEs describing the dynamics of fluid mixtures. While the incompressible case
with constant density was enlighted well enough due to results by Chen and
J\""ungel (isothermal case), or Marion and Temam, some open questions remain for
the weak solution theory of gas mixtures with their corresponding equations of
mixed parabolic-hyperbolic type. For instance, Mucha, Pokorny and Zatorska
showed the possibility to stabilise the hyperbolic component by means of the
Bresch-Desjardins technique and a regularisation of pressure preventing vacuum.
The result by Dreyer, Druet, Gajewski and Guhlke avoids ex machina
stabilisations, but the mathematical assumption that the Onsager matrix is
uniformly positive on certain subspaces leads, in the dilute limit, to infinite
diffusion velocities which are not compatible with the Maxwell-Stefan form of
diffusion fluxes. In this paper, we prove the existence of global weak
solutions for isothermal and ideal compressible mixtures with natural

on the binary Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities, which compensates possibly extreme

  Routing in SDN","  Dynamic routing in software-defined networking (SDN) can be viewed as a
centralized decision-making problem. Most of the existing deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) agents can address it, thanks to the deep neural network
(DNN)incorporated. However, fully-connected feed-forward neural network (FFNN)
is usually adopted, where spatial correlation and temporal variation of traffic
flows are ignored. This drawback usually leads to significantly high
computational complexity due to large number of training parameters. To
overcome this problem, we propose a novel model-free framework for dynamic
routing in SDN, which is referred to as spatio-temporal deterministic policy
gradient (STDPG) agent. Both the actor and critic networks are based on
identical DNN structure, where a combination of convolutional neural network
(CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) with temporal attention
mechanism, CNN-LSTM-TAM, is devised. By efficiently exploiting spatial and
temporal features, CNNLSTM-TAM helps the STDPG agent learn better from the
experience transitions. Furthermore, we employ the prioritized experience
replay (PER) method to accelerate the convergence of model training. The
experimental results show that STDPG can automatically adapt for current
network environment and achieve robust convergence. Compared with a number
state-ofthe-art DRL agents, STDPG achieves better routing solutions in terms of
the average end-to-end delay.

hindsight. They are a major alternative to classic worst-case competitive
analysis, of particular importance in the design and analysis of simple
(posted-price) incentive compatible mechanisms with provable approximation
guarantees.
  A central open problem in this area concerns subadditive combinatorial
auctions. Here $n$ agents with subadditive valuation functions compete for the
assignment of $m$ items. The goal is to find an allocation of the items that
maximizes the total value of the assignment. The question is whether there
exists a prophet inequality for this problem that significantly beats the best
known approximation factor of $O(\log m)$.
  We make major progress on this question by providing an $O(\log \log m)$
prophet inequality. Our proof goes through a novel primal-dual approach. It is
also constructive, resulting in an online policy that takes the form of static
and anonymous item prices that can be computed in polynomial time given
appropriate query access to the valuations. As an application of our approach,
we construct a simple and incentive compatible mechanism based on posted prices
that achieves an $O(\log \log m)$ approximation to the optimal revenue for
subadditive valuations under an item-independence assumption.

on EUV intensity changes. We also look at the evolution of the corona in
equatorial and polar regions and compare them at different phases of the solar
cycle, as well as with sunspot number evolution and with the PROBA2/Lyman-Alpha

series (SWAP on-disk average brightness, sunspot number and LYRA irradiance)
are very well correlated, with correlation coefficients around 0.9. The average
rotation rate of bright features at latitudes of +15, 0, and -15 degrees was
around 15 degree/day throughout the period studied. A secondary peak in EUV
averaged intensity at the Poles was observed on the descending phase of SC24.
These peaks (at North and South poles respectively) seem to be associated with
the start of the development of the (polar) coronal holes. Large-scale off-limb

days. Our regression analysis shows that the number of chat messages is the
best predictor and predicts productivity measured both in the number of commits

  Context-Aware Learning from 7T Diffusion MRI","  Deep cerebellar nuclei are a key structure of the cerebellum that are
involved in processing motor and sensory information. It is thus a crucial step
to precisely segment deep cerebellar nuclei for the understanding of the
cerebellum system and its utility in deep brain stimulation treatment. However,
it is challenging to clearly visualize such small nuclei under standard
clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and therefore an automatic
patient-specific segmentation is not feasible. Recent advances in 7 Tesla (T)
MRI technology and great potential of deep neural networks facilitate
automatic, fast, and accurate segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel
deep learning framework (referred to as DCN-Net) for the segmentation of deep
cerebellar dentate and interposed nuclei on 7T diffusion MRI. DCN-Net
effectively encodes contextual information on the image patches without
consecutive pooling operations and adding complexity via proposed dilated dense
blocks. During the end-to-end training, label probabilities of dentate and
interposed nuclei are independently learned with a hybrid loss, handling highly
imbalanced data. Finally, we utilize self-training strategies to cope with the
problem of limited labeled data. To this end, auxiliary dentate and interposed
nuclei labels are created on unlabeled data by using DCN-Net trained on manual
labels. We validate the proposed framework using 7T B0 MRIs from 60 subjects.
Experimental results demonstrate that DCN-Net provides better segmentation than
atlas-based deep cerebellar nuclei segmentation tools and other
state-of-the-art deep neural networks in terms of accuracy and consistency. We
further prove the effectiveness of the proposed components within DCN-Net in
dentate and interposed nuclei segmentation.

  Gaps in Lunar Digital Elevation Maps","  With the advent of NASA's lunar reconnaissance orbiter (LRO), a large amount
of high-resolution digital elevation maps (DEMs) have been constructed by using
narrow-angle cameras (NACs) to characterize the Moon's surface. However, NAC
DEMs commonly contain no-data gaps (voids), which makes the map less reliable.
To resolve the issue, this paper provides a deep-learning-based framework for
the probabilistic reconstruction of no-data gaps in NAC DEMs. The framework is
built upon a state of the art stochastic process model, attentive neural
processes (ANP), and predicts the conditional distribution of elevation on the
target coordinates (latitude and longitude) conditioned on the observed
elevation data in nearby regions. Furthermore, this paper proposes sparse
attentive neural processes (SANPs) that not only reduces the linear
computational complexity of the ANP O(N) to the constant complexity O(K) but
enhance the reconstruction performance by preventing overfitting and
over-smoothing problems. The proposed method is evaluated on the Apollo 17
landing site (20.0{\deg}N and 30.4{\deg}E), demonstrating that the suggested
approach successfully reconstructs no-data gaps with uncertainty analysis while
preserving the high resolution of original NAC DEMs.

is critical to understand the dynamical behavior of networked systems, ranging
from the Internet and the World Wide Web to biological networks and social
networks. Prior studies usually focus on the structure-based estimation to
infer network sizes, degree distributions, average degrees, and more. Little
effort attempted to estimate the specific degree of each vertex from a sampled
induced graph, which prevents us from measuring the lethality of nodes in
protein networks and influencers in social networks. The current approaches
dramatically fail for a tiny sampled induced graph and require a specific
sampling method and a large sample size. These approaches neglect information
of the vertex state, representing the dynamical behavior of the networked
system, such as the biomass of species or expression of a gene, which is useful
for degree estimation. We fill this gap by developing a framework to infer
individual vertex degrees using both information of the sampled topology and
vertex state. We combine the mean-field theory with combinatorial optimization
to learn vertex degrees. Experimental results on real networks with a variety
of dynamics demonstrate that our framework can produce reliable degree
estimates and dramatically improve existing link prediction methods by
replacing the sampled degrees with our estimated degrees.

essentials of a given document. Conventional methods normally apply an
encoder-decoder architecture to generate the output keyphrases for an input
document, where they are designed to focus on each current document so they
inevitably omit crucial corpus-level information carried by other similar
documents, i.e., the cross-document dependency and latent topics. In this
paper, we propose CDKGen, a Transformer-based keyphrase generator, which
expands the Transformer to global attention with cross-document attention
networks to incorporate available documents as references so as to generate
better keyphrases with the guidance of topic information. On top of the
proposed Transformer + cross-document attention architecture, we also adopt a
copy mechanism to enhance our model via selecting appropriate words from
documents to deal with out-of-vocabulary words in keyphrases. Experiment
results on five benchmark datasets illustrate the validity and effectiveness of
our model, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all datasets.
Further analyses confirm that the proposed model is able to generate keyphrases
consistent with references while keeping sufficient diversity. The code of
CDKGen is available at https://github.com/SVAIGBA/CDKGen.

Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high

cross-entropy loss sometimes assisted with auxiliary loss functions like center
loss, contrastive loss and triplet loss. These auxiliary loss functions
facilitate better discrimination between the different classes of interest.
However, recent studies hint at the fact that these loss functions do not take
into account the intrinsic angular distribution exhibited by the low-level and
high-level feature representations. This results in less compactness between
samples from the same class and unclear boundary separations between data
clusters of different classes. In this paper, we address this issue by
proposing the use of geometric constraints, rooted in Riemannian geometry.
Specifically, we propose Angular Margin Contrastive Loss (AMC-Loss), a new loss
function to be used along with the traditional cross-entropy loss. The AMC-Loss
employs the discriminative angular distance metric that is equivalent to
geodesic distance on a hypersphere manifold such that it can serve a clear
geometric interpretation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMC-Loss by
providing quantitative and qualitative results. We find that although the
proposed geometrically constrained loss-function improves quantitative results
modestly, it has a qualitatively surprisingly beneficial effect on increasing
the interpretability of deep-net decisions as seen by the visual explanations
generated by techniques such as the Grad-CAM. Our code is available at

the problem, this paper proposes an automatic registration method based on
structural features and three-dimension (3D) phase correlation. In the proposed
method, the LiDAR point cloud data is first transformed into the intensity map,
which is used as the reference image. Then, we employ the Fast operator to
extract uniformly distributed interest points in the aerial image by a
partition strategy and perform a local geometric correction by using the
collinearity equation to eliminate scale and rotation difference between
images. Subsequently, a robust structural feature descriptor is build based on
dense gradient features, and the 3D phase correlation is used to detect control
points (CPs) between aerial images and LiDAR data in the frequency domain,
where the image matching is accelerated by the 3D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
Finally, the obtained CPs are employed to correct the exterior orientation
elements, which is used to achieve co-registration of aerial images and LiDAR
data. Experiments with two datasets of aerial images and LiDAR data show that
the proposed method is much faster and more robust than state of the art

phase transitions arising in the steady state of transverse-field Ising models
after a quantum quench. Starting from a fully polarized ferromagnetic initial
condition these transitions separate a phase with nonvanishing magnetization
along the ordering direction from a symmetric phase upon increasing the
transverse field. We consider two paradigmatic cases, a one-dimensional
long-range model with power-law interactions $\propto 1/r^{\alpha}$ decaying
algebraically as a function of distance $r$ and a two-dimensional system with
short-range nearest-neighbour interactions. In the former case we identify
dynamical phase transitions for $\alpha \lesssim 2$ and we extract the critical
exponents from a data collapse of the steady state magnetization for up to 1200
lattice sites. We find identical exponents for $\alpha \lesssim 1$, suggesting
that the dynamical transitions in this regime fall into the same universality
class as the nonergodic mean-field limit. The two-dimensional Ising model is
believed to be thermalizing, which we also confirm using exact diagonalization
for small system sizes. Thus, the dynamical transition is expected to
correspond to the thermal phase transition, which is consistent with our data
upon comparing to equilibrium quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. We further test
the accuracy of the discrete truncated Wigner approximation by comparing
against numerically exact methods such as exact diagonalization, tensor network
as well as artificial neural network states and we find good quantitative
agreement on the accessible time scales.

  scalar field and matter","  A matter-coupled scalar field model is presented in obtaining a scalar fifth
force when the constraint of the current cosmological constant is satisfied.
The interaction potential energy density between the scalar field and matter
has a symmetry-breaking form with two potential wells. The cosmological
constant is proven to be a value of the scalar-field's self-interaction
potential energy density at the minimum of an effective
matter-density-dependent potential energy density. The effective potential is a
sum of the interaction potential and the self-interaction potential of the
scalar field. The scalar field can stably sit at the minimum and then the
time-dependent cosmological `constant' behaves like a constant. The observed
cosmic acceleration can be accounted for the scalar field. The scalar field is
also extrapolated to account for inflation at the inflationary era of the
Universe. In this era matter fluid is relativistic and then the interaction
potential wells vanish. The unconfined quintessence therefore dominates the
evolution of the Universe. It is concluded that `Planck 2018 results' favour
the closed space of the Universe. The reasons are not only the measured value
of the current Hubble constant, but also the observed feature of a concave
potential in the framework of single-field inflationary models. By invoking a
pseudo-potential in the inflationary era, the concave feature can be attributed
to the pseudo-potential although the self-interaction potential is a convex
function. The pseudo-potential is defined by a sum of the self-interaction
potential and the energy density scale of the curvature of the Universe. It is
that the positive curvature leads to the concave feature of the
pseudo-potential.

privacy-sensitive data on mobile devices while retaining all the data on their
local storages. However, FL asks the mobile devices to perform heavy
communication and computation tasks, i.e., devices are requested to upload and
download large-volume NN models and train them. This paper proposes a novel
unsupervised pre-training method adapted for FL, which aims to reduce both the
communication and computation costs through model compression. Since the
communication and computation costs are highly dependent on the volume of NN
models, reducing the volume without decreasing model performance can reduce
these costs. The proposed pre-training method leverages unlabeled data, which
is expected to be obtained from the Internet or data repository much more
easily than labeled data. The key idea of the proposed method is to obtain a
``good'' subnetwork from the original NN using the unlabeled data based on the
lottery hypothesis. The proposed method trains an original model using a
denoising auto encoder with the unlabeled data and then prunes small-magnitude
parameters of the original model to generate a small but good subnetwork. The
proposed method is evaluated using an image classification task. The results
show that the proposed method requires 35\% less traffic and computation time
than previous methods when achieving a certain test accuracy.

field S0 galaxy, NGC 3115, out to $\sim6.5$ half-light radii ($R_\mathrm{e}$)
from its stars (integrated starlight), globular clusters (GCs) and planetary
nebulae (PNe). We find evidence of three kinematic regions with an inner
transition at $\sim0.2\ R_\mathrm{e}$ from a dispersion-dominated bulge
($V_\mathrm{rot}/\sigma <1$) to a fast-rotating disk ($V_\mathrm{rot}/\sigma
>1$), and then an additional transition from the disk to a slowly rotating
spheroid at $\sim2-2.5\, R_\mathrm{e}$, as traced by the red GCs and PNe (and
possibly by the blue GCs beyond $\sim5\, R_\mathrm{e}$). From comparison with
simulations, we propose an assembly history in which the original progenitor
spiral galaxy undergoes a gas-rich minor merger that results in the embedded
kinematically cold disk that we see today in NGC 3115. At a later stage, dwarf
galaxies, in mini mergers (mass-ratio $<$ 1:10), were accreted building-up the
outer slowly rotating spheroid, with the central disk kinematics largely
unaltered. Additionally, we report new spectroscopic observations of a sample
of ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) around NGC 3115 with the Keck/KCWI instrument.
We find that five UCDs are inconsistent with the general rotation field of the
GCs, suggesting an \textit{ex-situ} origin for these objects, i.e. perhaps the
remnants of tidally stripped dwarfs. A further seven UCDs follow the GC
rotation pattern, suggesting an \textit{in-situ} origin and, possibly a GC-like
nature.

chosen to be the mean of those in the pool. This allows us to preserve the
building thermal dynamics of the pool. We then apply inverse optimization to
estimate the homothetic parameters with bilevel programming. The lower level
characterizes the price-response of the ensemble by a set of marginal utility
curves and a homothet of the prototype building, which, in turn, are inferred
in the upper-level problem. The upper level minimizes the mean absolute error
over a training sample. This bilevel program is transformed into a regularized
nonlinear problem in which the homothetic parameters stemming from a heuristic
are fixed, and the remaining variables initialized to the values resulting from
that heuristic. This heuristic consists in solving two linear programs and its
solution is deemed a suitable proxy for the original bilevel problem. The
results have been compared to state-of-the-art methodologies.

  Training Method for Extremely Imbalanced Data Sets","  Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning is widely used in many applications, where a
binary classifier is trained on the datasets consisting of only positive and
unlabeled samples. In this paper, we improve PU learning over state-of-the-art
from two aspects. Firstly, existing model evaluation methods for PU learning
requires ground truth of unlabeled samples, which is unlikely to be obtained in
practice. In order to release this restriction, we propose an asymptotic
unbiased practical AUL (area under the lift) estimation method, which makes use
of raw PU data without prior knowledge of unlabeled samples.
  Secondly, we propose ProbTagging, a new training method for extremely
imbalanced data sets, where the number of unlabeled samples is hundreds or
thousands of times that of positive samples. ProbTagging introduces probability
into the aggregation method. Specifically, each unlabeled sample is tagged
positive or negative with the probability calculated based on the similarity to
its positive neighbors. Based on this, multiple data sets are generated to
train different models, which are then combined into an ensemble model.
Compared to state-of-the-art work, the experimental results show that
ProbTagging can increase the AUC by up to 10%, based on three industrial and
two artificial PU data sets.

signs of compositeness. One such state is a pseudo-scalar boson resulting from
the breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry common to most composite setups, and whose

operate at low centre-of-mass energies. We present a simplified outline of a

physics, but its formulation inside media is still controversial and unclear.
The textbook-accepted formulation of electromagnetic force was proposed by
Lorentz in the 19th century, but its validity has been challenged due to
incompatibility with the special relativity and momentum conservation. The
Einstein-Laub formulation, which can reconcile those conflicts, was suggested
as an alternative to the Lorentz formulation. However, intense debates on these
two formulations are still going on due to lack of experimental evidences.
Here, we report the first experimental investigation of topological charge of
optical force inside a solid dielectric, aiming to distinguish the two
formulations. The experimental results show that the optical force exerted by a
Gaussian beam has components with the topological charge of both 2 and 0, which
cannot be supported solely by the Lorentz or the Einstein-Laub formulation.
Instead, we found a modified Helmholtz theory could explain our experimental
results. The unraveled topological charge of optical force will not only
contribute to the ultimate determination of the correct force formulation in
classical electrodynamics, but also have broad and far-reaching impact on many
science and engineering branches involving electromagnetic forces.

correntropy measure is used instead of utilizing Frobenius norm error to
improve the robustness of motion averaging against outliers. According to the
half-quadratic technique, the correntropy measure based optimization problem
can be solved by the alternating minimization procedure, which includes
operations of weight assignment and weighted motion averaging. Further, we
design a selection strategy of adaptive kernel width to take advantage of
correntropy. Experimental results on benchmark data sets illustrate that the

crucial to aid in disentangling these signals from that of a planet's Doppler
wobble. In this work, we investigate activity related features as seen in
disk-integrated spectra from the HARPS-N solar telescope. We divide
high-activity spectral echelle orders by low-activity master templates (as
defined using both log R'HK and images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory,
SDO), creating ""relative spectra"". With resolved images of the surface of the
Sun (via SDO), the faculae and spot filling factors can be calculated, giving a
measure of activity independent of, and in addition to, log R'HK. We find
pseudo-emission (and pseudo-absorption) features in the relative spectra that
are similar to those reported in our previous work on alpha Cen B. In alpha Cen
B, the features are shown to correlate better to changes in faculae filling
factor than spot filling factor. In this work we more confidently identify
changes in faculae coverage of the visible hemisphere of the Sun as the source
of features produced in the relative spectra. Finally, we produce trailed
spectra to observe the RV component of the features, which show that the
features move in a redward direction as one would expect when tracking active
regions rotating on the surface of a star.

Scrum Master performs a set of 9 leadership roles which are transferred to the
team over time (Spiegler et al., 2019). We aimed at conducting a quantitative
exploration that examines the presence and change of the 9-Factory Theory in

Scrum Master role is most often distributed in teams that had been working
between 3 and 5 months in an agile manner. Yet, we also find that the
leadership roles predominantly remain with one dedicated Scrum Master. Based on
our results we suggest to group the 9-Factor Theory into three clusters: the
Scrum Master is rather linked to psychological team factors (1), while the team
tends to be linked to rather product-related factors (2). Organizational
factors (3) are less often present. Our practical implications suggest an
extension of the Scrum Master description. Furthermore, our study lays

Respiratory information is extracted from multiple sources and fed into an RR

data from 30 healthy adults who performed diverse controlled breathing tasks
while lying supine in a dark room and reproduced central and obstructive apneic

improved the root mean square error (RMSE) accuracy of the RR estimation from

this drawback has been the object of numerous solution attempts in the standard
low-frequency breakdown regime for scattering problems, the eddy-current regime
requires a specific treatment. In this contribution, we present an extension of
the recently introduced quasi-Helmholtz projectors based preconditioning of the
PMCHWT to obtain an equation stable at low frequencies and specifically in
three regimes relevant for eddy currents analyses: (i) when the frequency
decreases with a constant conductivity, (ii) when the conductivity increases at
fixed frequency and (iii) when the frequency decreases while keeping the
product of the frequency and the conductivity constant. Being based on
quasi-Helmholtz projectors our new strategy does not further degrade the
conditioning of the original equation and is compatible with existing fast
solvers. The resulting full-wave formulation is capable of smoothly
transitioning from simulations at high frequencies to the different

applications. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of our approach in all

the spin-orbit coupling at the Pt/CoO$_x$ interface. In contrast to the
Pt/CoO$_x$/Co film, the SOTs in the Pt/PyO$_x$/Py film are dominated by the
bulk spin-orbit coupling. Our result shows that the interfacial oxidation of
the Pt/Py film suppresses the DL-SOT and reverses the sign of the FL-SOT. The
change of the SOTs can be attributed to the change of the real and imaginary
parts of the spin mixing conductance induced by the insertion of the insulating
PyO$_x$ layer. These results show that the interfacial oxidation provides an
effective way to manipulate the strength and sign of the SOTs.

interaction between a free fluid and a fluid in a poroelastic medium on
isotropic meshes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in\{2,3\}$. The approach utilizes the

suitable evaluation on the residual of the finite element solution. It is
proven that the a posteriori error estimate provided in this paper is both
reliable and efficient. The proof of reliability makes use of suitable
auxiliary problems, diverse continuous inf-sup conditions satisfied by the
bilinear forms involved, Helmholtz decomposition, and local approximation
properties of the Cl\'ement interpolant. On the other hand, inverse
inequalities, and the localization technique based on simplexe-bubble and
face-bubble functions are the main tools for proving the efficiency of the
estimator. Up to minor modifications, our analysis can be extended to other
finite element subspaces yielding a stable Galerkin scheme.

notably look at the impact on jet collimation of a misalignment between the
outflow, as it stems from the source, and the magnetic field. For small
misalignments, a magnetic nozzle forms and redirects the outflow in a
collimated jet. For growing misalignments, this nozzle becomes increasingly
asymmetric, disrupting jet formation. Our results thus suggest outflow/magnetic

a variety of objects. Furthermore, they provide a possible interpretation for
the observed structuring of astrophysical jets. Jet modulation could be
interpreted as the signature of changes over time in the outflow/ambient field

changes in the direction of the ambient field.

remarkable performance on analysis of surgical videos, however, heavily relying
on large-scale labelled datasets. Unfortunately, the annotation is not often

In this paper, we propose a novel active learning method for cost-effective

convolutional network (NL-RCNet), which introduces non-local block to capture
the long-range temporal dependency (LRTD) among continuous frames. We then
formulate an intra-clip dependency score to represent the overall dependency
within this clip. By ranking scores among clips in unlabelled data pool, we
select the clips with weak dependencies to annotate, which indicates the most
informative ones to better benefit network training. We validate our approach
on a large surgical video dataset (Cholec80) by performing surgical workflow
recognition task. By using our LRTD based selection strategy, we can outperform
other state-of-the-art active learning methods. Using only up to 50% of
samples, our approach can exceed the performance of full-data training.

transition between the two lowest rotational levels of the ground vibrational
state, one can generate two dressed states of mixed parity using a microwave
laser. These dressed states are then used as the two lower states of a
$\Lambda$-type three-level scheme using two infra-red lasers to couple them to
another ro-vibrational level in the ground-state manifold. Our analytical and
numerical results show that, when one of infra-red lasers used as a probe and
the other as a control field with a fixed detuning, there are two distinct
probe detuning regimes where the system can exhibit NRI with figure of merit
reaching as high as 10. The first regime dubbed as NRI-I is the red-detuned
side of the probe field and away from the two-photon or dark-state resonance.
The other regime called as NRI-II is close to the dark-state resonance or
electro-magnetically induced transparency (EIT). While the first regime has a
broad frequency span the second one has relatively narrow width. We interpret
our results in terms of the proximity of EIT, quantum interference and

  predicts survival in paediatric brain tumours","  Background Brain tumours represent the highest cause of mortality in the
paediatric oncological population. Diagnosis is commonly performed with
magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Survival biomarkers are
challenging to identify due to the relatively low numbers of individual tumour
types, especially for rare tumour types such as atypical rhabdoid tumours.
  Methods 69 children with biopsy-confirmed brain tumours were recruited into
this study. All participants had both perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging
performed at diagnosis. Data were processed using conventional methods, and a
Bayesian survival analysis performed. Unsupervised and supervised machine
learning were performed with the survival features, to determine novel
sub-groups related to survival. Sub-group analysis was undertaken to understand
differences in imaging features, which pertain to survival.
  Findings Survival analysis showed that a combination of diffusion and
perfusion imaging were able to determine two novel sub-groups of brain tumours
with different survival characteristics (p <0.01), which were subsequently
classified with high accuracy (98%) by a neural network. Further analysis of
high-grade tumours showed a marked difference in survival (p=0.029) between the
two clusters with high risk and low risk imaging features.
  Interpretation This study has developed a novel model of survival for
paediatric brain tumours, with an implementation ready for integration into
clinical practice. Results show that tumour perfusion plays a key role in
determining survival in brain tumours and should be considered as a high
priority for future imaging protocols.

programs. We argue that a key limitation of existing systems is that they use
entailment to guide the hypothesis search. This approach is limited because
entailment is a binary decision: a hypothesis either entails an example or does
not, and there is no intermediate position. To address this limitation, we go
beyond entailment and use \emph{example-dependent} loss functions to guide the
search, where a hypothesis can partially cover an example. We implement our
idea in Brute, a new ILP system which uses best-first search, guided by an
example-dependent loss function, to incrementally build programs. Our
experiments on three diverse program synthesis domains (robot planning, string
transformations, and ASCII art), show that Brute can substantially outperform
existing ILP systems, both in terms of predictive accuracies and learning

  gears","  The miniaturization of gears towards the nanoscale is a formidable task
posing a variety of challenges to current fabrication technologies. In context,
the understanding, via computer simulations, of the mechanisms mediating the
transfer of rotational motion between nanoscale gears can be of great help to
guide the experimental designs. Based on atomistic molecular dynamics
simulations in combination with a nearly rigid-body approximation, we study the
transmission of rotational motion between molecule gears and solid-state gears,
respectively. For the molecule gears under continuous driving, we identify
different regimes of rotational motion depending on the magnitude of the
external torque. In contrast, the solid-state gears behave like ideal gears
with nearly perfect transmission. Furthermore, we simulate the manipulation of
the gears by a scanning-probe tip and we find that the mechanical transmission
strongly depends on the center of mass distance between gears. A new regime of
transmission is found for the solid-state gears.

deformation of the matrix assuming that the fractures are open and filled by
the fluids, as well as small deformations and a linear elastic constitutive

facilitating an efficient and low-loss ring-to-ring energy transfer. We show
that energy shifts, radiative lifetimes, and emission patterns of excitons and
biexcitons in such rings can be tailored via the orientation of the individual
dipoles. Tilting the polarization from perpendicular to tangential to the ring
dramatically changes the lifetime of the symmetric exciton state from
superradiance to subradiance with the radiated field acquiring orbital angular
momentum. At a magic tilt angle all excitons are degenerate and the transport
fidelity between two rings exhibits a minimum. Further simulations suggest
that, for certain parameters, the decay decreases double-exponentially with the
emitter's density. Disorder in the rings' structure can even enhance radiative
lifetimes. The transport efficiency strongly depends on polarization and size,
which we demonstrate by simulating a bio-inspired example of two rings with 9

field distribution in the most superradiant state in a full LHC multi-ring

early phase after core bounce. As expected, we find that the time evolution of
gravitational wave frequencies depends strongly on the dimension of numerical
simulation as well as the equation of state for high density matter. Even so,
we find that the fundamental frequency as a function of PNS average density and
the ratio of the specific eigenfrequencies to the fundamental frequency as a
function of PNS properties are independent of the dimension of the numerical
simulations, where the dependence of the equation of state is also very weak in
this early postbounce phase. Thus, one can safely discuss the gravitational
wave frequencies of the PNSs as a function of the PNS average density or

tightly correlated with the host galaxy's star-formation rate (SFR). We explore
this connection at sub-galactic scales spanning ${\sim}$7 dex in SFR and
${\sim}$8 dex in specific SFR (sSFR). There is good agreement with established
relations down to ${\rm SFR {\simeq} 10^{-3}\,M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$, below which
an excess of X-ray luminosity emerges. This excess likely arises from low mass
X-ray binaries. The intrinsic scatter of the $L_X$-SFR relation is constant,
not correlated with SFR. Different star formation indicators scale with $L_X$
in different ways, and we attribute the differences to the effect of star
formation history. The SFR derived from H$\alpha$ shows the tightest
correlation with X-ray luminosity because H$\alpha$ emission probes stellar
populations with ages similar to HMXB formation timescales, but the
H$\alpha$-based SFR is reliable only for $\rm sSFR{>}10^{-12}\,M_\odot \,

considering the direct interaction between the bodies inolved, thus treating
the effect of an intervening solvent implicitly by a rescaling of the
corresponding Hamaker constant. Here, we provide a generalization of DA to the
case of a molecular medium between the bodies, as is the case in most
applications. The derivation is based on an explicit statistical-mechanical
treatment of the contribution to the interaction force from a molecular solvent
using a general expression for intermolecular and molecule-surface
interactions. Starting from an exact expression for the force, DA is arrived at
by a series of well-defined approximations. Our results show that DA remains
valid in a molecular solvent as long as (i) the surface-molecule interactions
are of much shorter range than the radius $R$ of the sphere and (ii) the
density correlation length in the solvent is smaller than $R$. We furthermore
show that DA remains valid for forces due to capillary induced phase

resonance-free formulation, suffers from an ill-conditioning that strongly
depends on the frequency and discretization density, both in the low- and

cures the low- and the high-frequency as well as the dense discretization

report an idealized numerical study of phase changes between a solid and an
adjacent turbulent, stratified shear flow. We use the phase-field method to
dynamically couple the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid with the heat
equation for the solid. We investigate the evolution of an initially-flat solid
boundary overlying a pressure-driven turbulent flow. We assume a linear
equation of state and change the sign of the thermal expansion coefficient,
such that the background density stratification is either stable, neutral or
unstable. We find that channels aligned with the direction of the mean flow are
generated spontaneously by phase changes at the fluid-solid interface.
Streamwise vortices in the fluid, the interface topography and the temperature
field in the solid influence each other and adjust until a statistical steady
state is obtained. The crest-to-trough amplitude of the channels are larger
than about 10$\delta_{\nu}$ in all cases, with $\delta_{\nu}$ the viscous
length scale, but are much larger and more persistent for an unstable
stratification than for a neutral or stable stratification. This happens
because a stable stratification makes cool melt water buoyant such that it
shields the channel from further melting, whereas an unstable stratification
makes cool melt water sink, allowing further melting by rising hot plumes. The
statistics of flow velocities and melt rates are investigated, and we find that
channels and keels emerging in our simulations do not significantly change the
mean drag coefficient.

  leptons from $Z^0$ decay and charmed mesons","  Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions are expected to generate a huge
electromagnetic field, $eB \approx 10^{18}\, Gauss$, that induces a splitting
of the directed flow, $v_1=\left\langle p_x/p_T \right\rangle $, of charged
particles and anti-particles. Such a splitting for charmed meson manifests even
for neutral particle/anti-particles pairs ($D^0, \overline{D}^0$), hence being
also a unique probe of the formation of the quark plasma phase. For the first
time here we show that specific time evolution of the electromagnetic field may
generate a $v_1(D^0) - v_1( \overline{D}^0)$ as huge as the one recently
observed at LHC against early expectations.
  Within this new research topic we point out a novel measurement: the directed
flow $v_1$ of leptons from $Z^0$ decay and its correlation to the $D$ mesons
one. Such a correlation between the $\Delta v_1$ of $l^{+} - l^{-}$ and
$D^0-\overline{D}^0$ would provide a strong probe of the electromagnetic origin
of the splitting and hence of the formation of a quark plasma phase with charm
quarks as degrees of freedom. The case of the $v_1({l^{\pm}})$ presents
features due to the peculiar form of the $p_T$ spectrum never appreciated
before in the study of heavy-ion collisions. We specifically predict a sign
change of the $\Delta v_1(p_T)$ of leptons at $p_T=45$ GeV$/c$, that can be
traced back to a universal relation of $\Delta v_1$ with the slope of the $p_T$
particle distribution and the integrated effect of the Lorentz force.

The time discretization of the TD-EFIE can be achieved by a space-time Galerkin

using the Marching-On-in-Time (MOT) algorithm. The differentiated TD-EFIE has
two problems: (i) the system matrix suffers from ill-conditioning when the time

solenoidal currents that grow slowly in the solution. In this work, we show
that (i) and (ii) can be alleviated by leveraging quasi-Helmholtz projectors to
separate the Helmholtz components of the induced current and rescale them

all maximal induced subgraphs of $G$ that belong to a certain hereditary graph
class. While its optimization version, known as the minimum vertex deletion
problem in literature, has been intensively studied, enumeration algorithms are
known for a few simple graph classes, e.g., independent sets, cliques, and
forests, until very recently [Conte and Uno, STOC 2019]. There is also a
connected variation of this problem, where one is concerned with only those
induced subgraphs that are connected. We introduce two new approaches, which
enable us to develop algorithms that solve both variations for a number of
important graph classes. A general technique that has been proved very powerful
in enumeration algorithms is to build a solution map, i.e., a multiple digraph
on all the solutions of the problem, and the key of this approach is to make
the solution map strongly connected, so that a simple traversal of the solution
map solves the problem. We introduce retaliation-free paths to certificate
strong connectedness of the solution map we build. Generalizing the idea of
Cohen, Kimelfeld, and Sagiv [JCSS 2008], we introduce the $t$-restricted
version, $t$ being a positive integer, of the maximal (connected) induced
subgraphs problem, and show that it is equivalent to the original problem in
terms of solvability in incremental polynomial time. Moreover, we give
reductions between the two variations, so that it suffices to solve one of the
variations for each class we study. Our work also leads to direct and simpler
proofs of several important known results.

new phenomenon has been transposed to the classical domain in electromagnetics

these macroscopic analogues are photonic/phononic crystals which are

typically constructed via a variable transformation of a uniform experimental
design. The inverse distribution function is one such transformation. The
discrepancy is a measure of how well the empirical distribution of any design
matches its target distribution. This chapter addresses the question of whether
a variable transformation of a low discrepancy uniform design yields a low
discrepancy design for the desired target distribution. The answer depends on
the two kernel functions used to define the respective discrepancies. If these
kernels satisfy certain conditions, then the answer is yes. However, these
conditions may be undesirable for practical reasons. In such a case, the
transformation of a low discrepancy uniform design may yield a design with a
large discrepancy. We illustrate how this may occur. We also suggest some
remedies. One remedy is to ensure that the original uniform design has optimal
one-dimensional projection, but this remedy works best if the design is dense,
or in other words, the ratio of sample size divided by the dimension of the
random variable is relatively large. Another remedy is to use the transformed
design as the input to a coordinate-exchange algorithm that optimizes the
desired discrepancy, and this works for both dense or sparse designs. The
effectiveness of these two remedies is illustrated via simulation.

  Recognition","  Emotion is an essential part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and human mental
health. Current emotion recognition research mainly focuses on single modality
(e.g., facial expression), while human emotion expressions are multi-modal in
nature. In this paper, we propose a hybrid emotion recognition system
leveraging two emotion-rich and tightly-coupled modalities, i.e., facial
expression and body gesture. However, unbiased and fine-grained facial
expression and gesture recognition remain a major problem. To this end, unlike
our rivals relying on contact or even invasive sensors, we explore the
commodity WiFi signal for device-free and contactless gesture recognition,
while adopting a vision-based facial expression. However, there exist two
design challenges, i.e., how to improve the sensitivity of WiFi signals and how
to process the large-volume, heterogeneous, and non-synchronous data
contributed by the two-modalities. For the former, we propose a signal
sensitivity enhancement method based on the Rician K factor theory; for the
latter, we combine CNN and RNN to mine the high-level features of bi-modal
data, and perform a score-level fusion for fine-grained recognition. To
evaluate the proposed method, we build a first-of-its-kind Vision-CSI Emotion
Database (VCED) and conduct extensive experiments. Empirical results show the
superiority of the bi-modality by achieving 83.24\% recognition accuracy for
seven emotions, as compared with 66.48\% and 66.67\% recognition accuracy by
gesture-only based solution and facial-only based solution, respectively. The

provides explanations on discrete language data, e.g. by removing a language
unit from an input and measuring the impact on a model's decision. We argue
that current occlusion-based methods often produce invalid or syntactically
incorrect language data, neglecting the improved abilities of recent NLP
models. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation methods disregard the discrete
distribution of data in NLP. Thus, we propose OLM: a novel explanation method
that combines occlusion and language models to sample valid and syntactically

other explanation methods in NLP and provide results that underline the

eliminates the linear and nonlinear distortions, while the followed DFE

algorithm exploits two equivalent decoding graphs.For each graph, the inner
code part, which consists of independent component codes, is decoded in

iteratively exchanged between the graphs until convergence. This algorithm
enjoys a higher decoding parallelism than the previous successive cancellation
algorithms, due to the avoidance of serial outer code processing. In this work,

  formation","  The dissolution of a body into quiescent water leads to density
stratifications at the interfaces that drive buoyant flows. Where the
stratification is unstable, the flow destabilizes into convective solute
plumes. By analogy with the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability where concentration
replaces temperature, this phenomenon is known as the solutal Rayleigh-B\'enard
instability. Here we report experiments of the dissolution of inclined
rectangular blocks made of salt, caramel or plaster in aqueous solutions of
various concentrations. The solute flows along the block while forming plumes
before they detach and sink. This flow along the block organizes the emission
of plumes within longitudinal parallel stripes with a well-defined millimeter
scale wavelength. The instability of the flow reflects on the concentration
field in the boundary layer, which engraves longitudinal grooves onto the
block. These grooves interact with the flow and turn into a paving of 3
dimensional cup like patterns that grow in size and propagate upstream. These
bedforms are reminiscent of the scallop bedforms observed on the walls of cave
or icebergs. Whereas the block interface is highly dynamical and evolves
through time, it remains flat on the global scale and recedes at a stationary
rate. We derive scaling laws for the receding velocity and the pattern genesis
at the inclined interface that is based on a concentration boundary layer of
constant thickness, which is controlled by the flow instability, but where the
patterns nor the flow along the block do not play any role. We apply these
results to the formation of sublimation patterns.

thereby the instants at which emails reach recipients (it is assumed email is
received instantaneously from the send time). However, they do not control the
duration it takes for recipients to open emails, labeled as time-to-open.
Importantly, among emails that are opened, most occur within a short window
from their send times. We posit that emails are likely to be opened sooner when
send times are convenient for recipients, while for other send times, emails
can get ignored. Thus, to compute appropriate send times it is important to
predict times-to-open accurately. We propose a recurrent neural network (RNN)
in a survival model framework to predict times-to-open, for each recipient.
Using that we compute appropriate send times. We experiment on a data set of
emails sent to a million customers over five months. The sequence of emails
received by a person from a sender is a result of interactions with past emails
from the sender, and hence contain useful signal that inform our model. This
sequential dependence affords our proposed RNN-Survival (RNN-S) approach to
outperform survival analysis approaches in predicting times-to-open. We show
that best times to send emails can be computed accurately from predicted
times-to-open. This approach allows a firm to tune send times of emails, which
is in its control, to favorably influence open rates and engagement.

spontaneous emission from a dye-embedded in a Metal/Insulator/Metal (d-MIM)

embedded in a MIM cavity whose resonances are tuned with the spectral emission
band of the chromophore. Angular and polarization resolved spectroscopy
experiments reveal that the radiated field is reshaped according to the angular
dispersion of the nanocavity, and that its spectrum manifests two bands with
different polarization corresponding to the p- and s-polarized resonances of
the cavity. The d-MIM cavities are a highly versatile system for polarization
and wavelength division multiplexing applications at the nanoscale, as well as
for near-field focused emission and nanolenses.

Specifically, we wish to compute $M\geq 2$ sums
$s_m=\sum_{k\in\mathcal{D}m}x_k$ over a shared complex-valued MAC at once with
minimal mean-squared error ($\mathsf{MSE}$). Finding appropriate Tx-Rx scaling
factors balance between a low error in the computation of $s_n$ and the
interference induced by it in the computation of other sums $s_m$, $m\neq n$.
In this paper, we are interested in designing an optimal Tx-Rx scaling policy
that minimizes the mean-squared error $\max_{m\in[1:M]}\mathsf{MSE}_m$ subject
to a Tx power constraint with maximum power $P$. We show that an optimal design
of the Tx-Rx scaling policy $\left(\bar{\mathbf{a}},\bar{\mathbf{b}}\right)$
involves optimizing (a) their phases and (b) their absolute values in order to
(i) decompose the computation of $M$ sums into, respectively, $M_R$ and $M_I$
($M=M_R+M_I$) calculations over real and imaginary part of the Rx signal and
(ii) to minimize the computation over each part -- real and imaginary --
individually. The primary focus of this paper is on (b). We derive conditions
(i) on the feasibility of the optimization problem and (ii) on the Tx-Rx
scaling policy of a local minimum for $M_w=2$ computations over the real
($w=R$) or the imaginary ($w=I$) part. Extensive simulations over a single Rx
chain for $M_w=2$ show that the level of interference in terms of $\Delta
D=|\mathcal{D}_2|-|\mathcal{D}_1|$ plays an important role on the ergodic
worst-case $\mathsf{MSE}$. At very high $\mathsf{SNR}$, typically only the
sensor with the weakest channel transmits with full power while all remaining
sensors transmit with less to limit the interference. Interestingly, we observe
that due to residual interference, the ergodic worst-case $\mathsf{MSE}$ is not
vanishing; rather, it converges to $\frac{|\mathcal{D}_1||\mathcal{D}_2|}{K}$
as $\mathsf{SNR}\rightarrow\infty$.

nanometric light confinement and waveguiding, and their optical properties are
mostly interpreted in terms of surface plasmon polaritons. Although classic
electromagnetic theory accurately describes their behavior, it often lacks
physical insight, letting some fundamental aspects of light interaction with
these structures unexplored. In this work, we elaborate a quantum mechanical
description of the MIM cavity as a double barrier quantum well. We identify the
square of the imaginary part of the refractive index of the metal as the
optical potential, and find that MIM cavity resonances are suppressed if the
ratio n/\k{appa} exceeds a certain limit, which shows that low n and high
\k{appa} are desired for strong and sharp cavity resonances. Interestingly, the
spectral regions of cavity mode suppression correspond to the interband
transitions of the metals, where the optical processes are intrinsically
non-Hermitian. The quantum treatment allows to describe the tunnel effect for
photons, and reveals that the MIM cavity resonances can be excited by resonant
tunneling via illumination through the metal, without the need of momentum
matching techniques such as prisms or grating couplers. By combining this
analysis with spectroscopic ellipsometry on experimental MIM structures, and by
developing a simple harmonic oscillator model of the MIM for the calculation of
its effective permittivity, we show that the cavity eigenmodes coincide with
low-loss zeros of the effective permittivity.

to reductions in fever incidences, as captured by smart thermometers, after a
mean lag of 6.5 days ($90\%$ within 3--10 days) that is consistent with the

mobility subsequently achieved greater reductions in fevers ($p<0.01$), with
the notable exception of New York City and its immediate vicinity. These
results indicate that social distancing has reduced the transmission of

proposed is based on the available facts like the onset of lockdown (as
announced by the Government on 25th day, {\tau}0 and the recovery pattern
dictated by a mean life recovery time of {\tau}1 ( normally said to be around
14 days). The data of infected COVID-19 patients from March 2, to April 16,

A slow rising exponential growth, with R0 close to 1/6, is found to represent
the infected counts indicating almost a linear rise. The rest of growth,
saturation and decay of data is comprehensibly modelled by incorporating
lockdown time controlled R0, having a normal error function like behaviour
decaying to zero in some time frame of {\tau}2 . The recovery mean life time
{\tau}1 dictates the peak and decay. The results predicted for coming days are
interesting and optimistic. The introduced time constants based on experimental
data for both the recovery rate as well as for determining the time span of
activity of R0 after the lockdown are subject of debate and provide possibility
to introduce trigger factors to alter these to be more suited to the model. The
model can be extended to other communities with their own R0 and recovery time
parameters.

constitute a highly versatile and very interesting model system to study and
engineer such mode coupling, since they can be realized by lithography-free
fabrication methods with fine control on the optical and geometrical
parameters. The resonant modes of such MIM cavities are epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)
resonances, which are appealing for non-linear photophysics and a variety of
applications. Here we study the hybridization of ENZ resonances in MIMIM
nanocavities, obtaining a very large mode splitting reaching 0.477 eV, Q
factors of the order of 40 in the visible spectral range, and fine control on
the resonance wavelength and mode linewidth by tuning the thickness of the
dielectric and metallic layers. A semi-classical approach that analyses the
MIMIM structure as a double quantum well system allows to derive the exact
analytical dispersion relation of the ENZ resonances, achieving perfect
agreement with numerical simulations and experiments. Interestingly, the
asymmetry of the mode splitting in a symmetric MIMIM cavity is not reflected in
the classical model of coupled oscillators, which can be directly related to
quantum mechanical tunneling for the coupling of the two cavities. Interpreting
the cavity resonances as resonant tunneling modes elucidates that can be
excited without momentum matching techniques. The broad tunability of
high-quality ENZ resonances together with their strong coupling efficiency
makes such MIMIM cavities an ideal platform for exploring light-matter
interaction, for example, by integration of quantum emitters in the dielectric
layers.

no suitable system that focuses on the ranking of countries based on the

region can indicate the growth of interests in science among the people of that
land. This paper introduces a novel ranking mechanism based on the rankings of
universities. Firstly, we introduce and discuss two new rankings of countries,
based on the rank of their universities. Secondly, we create rankings of
countries according to the selected method, based on the top 12000 universities
in webometrics.info (January 2012) and compare rankings of countries in 4
editions (January 2012 to July 2013). Firstly, we introduce two new methods of
ranking countries based on their university rankings, Weighted Ranking (WR) and
Average Ranking (AR). Secondly, we discuss how the introduced ranking systems,
perform in ranking countries based on the two years of data. Thirdly, we choose
QS (http://www.topuniversities.com) and webometrics.info as two different
classification systems for comparing rankings of countries, based on the top
500 universities in these rankings. Results indicate that the methodology can
be used to show the quality of the whole universities of each country used to
compare rankings of countries in practice compare to other countries in the
world.

past the rapid mass transfer stage. From the light curve and radial-velocity
modelling we find KIC 10736223 to be a detached Algol system with the
less-massive secondary nearly filling its Roche lobe. Based on the
short-cadence Kepler data, we analyzed intrinsic oscillations of the pulsator
and identified six secured independent $\delta$ Scuti-type pulsation modes
($f_{1}$, $f_3$, $f_{9}$, $f_{19}$, $f_{42}$, and $f_{48}$). We compute two
grids of theoretical models to reproduce the $\delta$ Scuti freqiencies, and
find fitting results of mass-accreting models meet well with those of
single-star evolutionary models. The fundamental parameters of the primary star
yielded with asteroseismology are $M$ = $1.57^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$ $M_{\odot}$, $Z$
= 0.009 $\pm$ 0.001, $R$ = $1.484^{+0.016}_{-0.028}$ $R_{\odot}$, $\log g$ =
$4.291^{+0.004}_{-0.009}$, $T_{\rm eff}$ = $7748^{+230}_{-378}$ K, $L$ =
$7.136^{+1.014}_{-1.519}$ $L_{\odot}$. The asteroseismic parameters match well
with the dynamical parameters derived from the binary model. Moreover, our
asteroseismic results show that the pulsator is an almost unevolved star with
an age between 9.46-11.65 Myr for single-star evolutionary models and 2.67-3.14
Myr for mass-accreting models. Thereofore, KIC 10736223 may be an Algol system
that has just undergone the rapid mass-transfer process.

cyclotron resonance ion source (ECRIS) with a minimum-B quadrupole magnetic
field topology. The magnetic field is made to conform to conventional ECRIS
with $B_\textrm{min}/B_\textrm{ECR}$ of 0.67 and a last closed magnetic
isosurface of 1.86$B_\textrm{ECR}$ at 10 GHz. The distribution of magnetic
field gradients parallel to the field, affecting the electron heating
efficiency, cover a range from 0 to 13 T/m, being similar to conventional
ECRIS. Therefore it is expected that the novel ion source produces warm
electrons and high charge state ions in significant number. Single electron
tracking simulations are used to estimate plasma flux distribution on the
plasma chamber walls and to provide an estimate of the ion density profile at
the extraction slit then used in ion optical simulations demonstrating high
transmission through the low energy beam transport. The designed ion source is
intended to study if the quadrupole field topology could produce high charge
state beams in comparable intensities to conventional ECRIS and efficiently
transport them through a low energy beamline, thus paving the way for a
superconducting ARC-ECRIS using the same field topology. Furthermore, the
prospects of the presented ion source design as an injector of a single-ended
accelerator for ion beam analysis are discussed.

nanostructured planar metallic or dielectric surfaces that can replace bulky
optical elements and enhance the capabilities of traditional far-field optics.
Furthermore, the potential of flat optics can go far beyond far-field
modulation, and can be exploited for functionality in the near-field itself.
Here, we design metasurfaces based on aperiodic arrays of plasmonic Au
nanostructures for tailoring the optical near-field in the visible and
near-infrared spectral range. The basic element of the arrays is a rhomboid
that is modulated in size, orientation and position to achieve the desired
functionality of the micron-size metasurface structure. Using
two-photon-photoluminescence as a tool to probethe near-field profiles in the
plane of the metasurfaces, we demonstrate the molding of light into different
near-field intensity patterns and active pattern control via the far-field
illumination. Finite element method simulations reveal that the near-field
modulation occurs via a combination of the plasmonic resonances of the
rhomboids and field enhancement in the nanoscale gaps in between the elements.
This approach enables optical elements that can switch the near-field
distribution across the metasurface via wavelength and polarization of the
incident far-field light, and provides pathways for light matter interaction in
integrated devices.

  Memories","  Data copy is a widely-used memory operation in many programs and operating
system services. In conventional computers, data copy is often carried out by
two separate read and write transactions that pass data back and forth between
the DRAM chip and the processor chip. Some prior mechanisms propose to avoid
this unnecessary data movement by using the shared internal bus in the DRAM
chip to directly copy data within the DRAM chip (e.g., between two DRAM banks).
While these methods exhibit superior performance compared to conventional
techniques, data copy across different DRAM banks is still greatly slower than
data copy within the same DRAM bank. Hence, these techniques have limited
benefit for the emerging 3D-stacked memories (e.g., HMC and HBM) that contain
hundreds of DRAM banks across multiple memory controllers. In this paper, we
present Network-on-Memory (NoM), a lightweight inter-bank data communication
scheme that enables direct data copy across both memory banks of a 3D-stacked
memory. NoM adopts a TDM-based circuit-switching design, where circuit setup is
done by the memory controller. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, NoM
enables both fast data copy between multiple DRAM banks and concurrent data
transfer operations. Our evaluation shows that NoM improves the performance of
data-intensive workloads by 3.8X and 75%, on average, compared to the baseline

showed that on input regular languages $L$ and $R$ it is decidable whether
there is a generalized sequential machine which maps $L$ onto $R$, and noticed
that the results cannot be extended to context-free languages. We investigate
regular matching problems with respect to substitutions. Conway studied the
problem ""$\exists\sigma:\sigma(L)\subseteq R$?"". He showed that there are
finitely many maximal solutions which are effectively computable, that every
solution is included in a maximal one, and $\sigma(x)$ is regular for all $x\in
X$.
  We generalize this type of results to infinite trees. For a regular tree
language given by a parity NTA, we can define an equivalence of finite index
which has the desired saturation property. For languages over infinite trees,
we define a notion of choice function $\gamma$ which for any tree $s$ over
$\Sigma\cup X$ and position $u$ labeled by variable $x\in X$ selects at most
one tree $\gamma(u)$ in $\sigma(x)$. In this way we define $\gamma_\infty(s)$
as the limit of a Cauchy sequence; and the union over all these
$\gamma_\infty(s)$ leads to a natural notion of $\sigma(s)$. Since or
definition coincides with the classical IO substitutions, we write
$\sigma_{io}(L)$ instead of $\sigma(L)$. By using choice functions, we obtain a
smooth generalization of Conway's results for infinite trees. This includes the
decidability of ""$\exists\sigma:\sigma_{io}(L)=R$?"", although it is not true in
general that $\sigma_{io}(L)$ is regular as soon as $\sigma(x)$ is regular for
all $x\in X$. As a special case, for $L$ context-free and $R$ regular
""$\exists\sigma:\sigma_{io}(L)\subseteq R$?"" is decidable, but
""$\exists\sigma:\sigma_{io}(L)=R$?"" is not. In this sense the decidability of
""$\exists\sigma:\sigma_{io}(L)=R$?"" if both $L$ and $R$ are regular can be
viewed as optimal.

a fine-grained manner, each agent in the cooperative group evaluates the
instance by calculating a continuous confidence score from its own perspective;
To leverage the correlations between these two extraction tasks, a confidence
consensus module is designed to gather the wisdom of all agents and
re-distribute the noisy training set with confidence-scored labels. Further,
the confidences are used to adjust the training losses of extractors.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets verify the benefits of
re-labeling noisy instance, and show that the proposed model significantly

mesoscopic ensembles of 1-5 atoms when they are detected by the selective field
ionization method. We investigated the spectra of the three-photon laser
excitation $ 5S_{1/2} \to 5P_{3/2} \to 6S_{1/2} \to nP_{3/2} $ of cold Rb
Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap. We have found that for mesoscopic
ensembles this method allows only a partial dipole blockage to be observed.
This is most likely related to the presence of parasitic electric fields
reducing the interaction energy of Rydberg atoms, the decrease in the
probability of detecting high states, and the strong angular dependence of the
interaction energy of Rydberg atoms in a single interaction volume.

  Photoplethmogram Derived Respiratory Rate","  Respiratory rate (RR) can be estimated from the photoplethmogram (PPG)
recorded by optical sensors in wearable devices. The fusion of estimates from
different PPG features has lead to an increase in accuracy, but also reduced
the numbers of available final estimates due to discarding of unreliable data.
We propose a novel, tunable fusion algorithm using covariance intersection to
estimate the RR from PPG (CIF). The algorithm is adaptive to the number of
available feature estimates and takes each estimates' trustworthiness into
account. In a benchmarking experiment using the CapnoBase dataset with
reference RR from capnography, we compared the CIF against the state-of-the-art
Smart Fusion (SF) algorithm. The median root mean square error was 1.4
breaths/min for the CIF and 1.8 breaths/min for the SF. The CIF significantly
increased the retention rate distribution of all recordings from 0.46 to 0.90
(p $<$ 0.001). The agreement with the reference RR was high with a Pearson's
correlation coefficient of 0.94, a bias of 0.3 breaths/min, and limits of
agreement of -4.6 and 5.2 breaths/min. In addition, the algorithm was
computationally efficient. Therefore, CIF could contribute to a more robust RR
estimation from wearable PPG recordings.

  Ultrafast Hole-Routing in Electronic-Doped Nanocrystals","  Low power photon upconversion (UC) based on sensitized triplet-triplet
annihilation (sTTA) is considered as the most promising upwards
wavelength-shifting technique to enhance the light harvesting capability of
solar devices by recovering the low-energy tail of the solar spectrum.
Semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) with conjugated organic ligands have been
proposed as broadband sensitizers for extending the light-harvesting capability
of sTTA-UC molecular absorbers. Key to their functioning is efficient energy
transfer (ET) from the NC to the triplet state of the ligands that sensitizes
the triplet state of free emitters, whose annihilation generates the
upconverted emission. To date, the triplet sensitization efficiency in such
systems is limited by parasitic processes, such as charge transfer (typically
of the photohole) to the organic ligand due to the disadvantageous band
alignment of typical NCs and organic moieties. Available strategies only
partially mitigate such losses and intrinsically limit the ET yield. Here we
demonstrate a new exciton-manipulation approach that enables loss-free ET
without detrimental side-effects. Specifically, we use CdSe NCs doped with gold
atoms featuring a hole-accepting state in the NC bandgap at a higher energy
than the HOMO level of the ligand 9-anthracene acid. Upon photoexcitation, the
NC photoholes are routed to the Au-state faster than their transfer to the
ligand, producing a long-lived bound exciton in perfect resonance with its
triplet state. This hinders hole-transfer losses and results in ~100% efficient
ET, over 50-fold higher than in standard NCs. By combining our hybrid
sensitizers with an annihilator moiety, we achieved an sTTA-UC efficiency of
~12% (~24% in the normalized definition), which is the highest value for hybrid
upconverters based on sTTA reported to date and approaches optimized organic
systems.

stability towards short-range van der Waals attractive and steric repulsive

colloidal silica, the sodium ions provide stability to the silica
nanoparticles. To understand the interaction among the silica and magnetite
nanoparticles, both, colloidal silica and magnetic fluid, were mixed in

using FTIR, TGA, and magnetic field induced microscopy. The FTIR and TGA data
reveal that silica interacts with the outer layer of lauric acid through the

lauric acid sheath varies with the concentration of silica nanoparticles. The
SEM images indicate nanorod formation, and its structure dimensions vary with

extremal form of dynamic linear functions. We find that moderately increased
population sizes extend the range of efficient algorithm configurations, and
that crossover boosts this positive effect substantially. Remarkably, similar
to the static setting of monotone functions in [Lengler, Zou, FOGA 2019], the
hardest region of optimization for $(\mu+1)$-EA is not close the optimum, but
far away from it. In contrast, for the $(\mu+1)$-GA, the region around the

  component of the magnetic field -- Analysis of ground-based data from the
  GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph","  The vertical component of the magnetic field ($B_\perp$) was found to reach a
constant value at the umbra-penumbra boundary of stable sunspots in a recent
statistical study of Hinode/SP data. The objective of this work is to verify
the existence of a constant value for $B_\perp$ at the umbra-penumbra boundary
from ground-based data in the near-infrared wavelengths and to determine its
value for GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) data. This is the first
statistical study on the Jurcak criterion with ground-based data, and we
compare it with the results from Hinode and HMI data. Eleven
spectropolarimetric data sets from the GRIS slit-spectograph containing stable
sunspots were selected from the GRIS archive (sdc.leibniz-kis.de). SIR
inversions including a polarimetric straylight correction are used to produce
maps of the magnetic field vector using the Fe 1564.8 and 1566.2 nm lines.
Averages of $B_\perp$ along umbra-penumbra boundaries are analyzed for the 11
data sets. Geometric differences between contours at the resulting
$B_\perp^{\rm const}$ value and contours in intensity, $\Delta P$, are
calculated. Averaged over the 11 sunspots, we find a value of
$B_\perp=1787\pm100$ gauss. Contours at $B_\perp=B_\perp^{\rm const}$ and
contours calculated in intensity maps match from a visual inspection and the
geometric distance $\Delta P$ was found to be on the order of 2 pixels.
Furthermore, the standard deviation between different data sets of averages
along umbra--penumbra contours is smaller for $B_\perp$ than for $B_\parallel$
by a factor of 2.4. Our results provide further support to the Jurcak criterion
with the existence of an invariable value $B_\perp^{\rm const}$ at the
umbra--penumbra boundary. We also found that the geometric difference, $\Delta
P$, between intensity contours and contours at $B_\perp=B_\perp^{\rm const}$
acts as an index of stability for sunspots.

the time horizon, so that trying each slate as a separate arm in a traditional

of algorithms that still have sub-linear regret with respect to the time

technique for preserving the divergence-free condition of magnetic field to

Godunov-type, or upwind, conservative codes. The evolution of the different
magnetic field components, located at zone interfaces using a staggered
representation, is achieved by calculating the electric field components at
cell edges, in a way that has to be consistent with the Riemann solver used for
the update of cell-centered fluid quantities at interfaces. Albeit several
approaches have been undertaken, the purpose of this work is, on the one hand,
to compare existing methods in terms of robustness and accuracy and, on the
other, to extend the upwind contrained transport (UCT) method by Londrillo &

schemes, either based on finite volumes or finite differences, and to other
physical systems retaining the same structure of the equations, such as that of

improvements in Low-Carbon Energy Technologies (LCETs). An efficient allocation
of R&D budgets to accelerate technological advancement necessitates a better
understanding of how LCETs rely on scientific knowledge. In this paper, we
sketch for the first time the evolution of knowledge bases for key LCETs and
show how technological interdependencies change in time. We use data covering
almost all US patents as well as scientific articles published in the past two
centuries to quantify the history of LCETs and their dependence on science. We
show how the drivers of low-carbon innovations shifted from Hydro and Wind
energy to Nuclear fission, and more recently to Solar PV and back to Wind. Our
analysis demonstrates that 1) LCETs rely increasingly on science, 2) Solar PV
and Nuclear fusion depend heavily on science, while Hydro energy does not, 3)
renewable and nuclear energy technologies rely on a strikingly different kind
of science, and 4) there is a remarkable convergence of scientific knowledge
bases of renewables over recent decades. These findings suggest a need for
technology-specific research policies, although targeted research in renewables
is likely to cross-fertilize a wider range of LCETs.

purposes. Those sensors are more expensive than visual (RGB) sensors, and
usually produce images with lower resolution. To this end, Cross-Modality
Super-Resolution methods were introduced, where an RGB image of a
high-resolution assists in increasing the resolution of the low-resolution
modality. However, fusing images from different modalities is not a trivial
task; the output must be artifact-free and remain loyal to the characteristics
of the target modality. Moreover, the input images are never perfectly aligned,
which results in further artifacts during the fusion process.
  We present CMSR, a deep network for Cross-Modality Super-Resolution, which
unlike previous methods, is designed to deal with weakly aligned images. The
network is trained on the two input images only, learns their internal
statistics and correlations, and applies them to up-sample the target modality.
CMSR contains an internal transformer that is trained on-the-fly together with
the up-sampling process itself, without explicit supervision. We show that CMSR
succeeds to increase the resolution of the input image, gaining valuable
information from its RGB counterpart, yet in a conservative way, without
introducing artifacts or irrelevant details.

  Recommendation","  With the uptake of algorithmic personalization in the news domain, news
organizations increasingly trust automated systems with previously considered
editorial responsibilities, e.g., prioritizing news to readers. In this paper
we study an automated news recommender system in the context of a news
organization's editorial values. We conduct and present two online studies with
a news recommender system, which span one and a half months and involve over
1,200 users. In our first study we explore how our news recommender steers
reading behavior in the context of editorial values such as serendipity,
dynamism, diversity, and coverage. Next, we present an intervention study where
we extend our news recommender to steer our readers to more dynamic reading
behavior. We find that (i) our recommender system yields more diverse reading
behavior and yields a higher coverage of articles compared to non-personalized
editorial rankings, and (ii) we can successfully incorporate dynamism in our
recommender system as a re-ranking method, effectively steering our readers to
more dynamic articles without hurting our recommender system's accuracy.

underlying Milky Way (MW) model or from N-body data. We used an updated
Besan\c{c}on Galactic model together with the latest PARSEC stellar
evolutionary tracks, now also including white dwarfs. We added the Magellanic
clouds and realistic open clusters with internal rotation. We empirically
modelled uncertainties based on Gaia DR2 (GDR2) and scaled them according to
the longer baseline in Gaia EDR3. The apparent magnitudes were reddened
according to a new selection of 3D extinction maps.
  To help with the Gaia selection function we provide all-sky magnitude limit
maps in G and BP for a few relevant GDR2 subsets together with the routines to
produce these maps for user-defined subsets. We supplement the catalog with
photometry and extinctions in non-Gaia bands. The catalog is available in the
Virtual Observatory and can be queried just like the actual Gaia EDR3 will be.
We highlight a few capabilities of the Astronomy Data Query Language (ADQL)
with educative catalog queries. We use the data extracted from those queries to
compare GeDR3mock to GDR2, which emphasises the importance of adding
observational noise to the mock data. Since the underlying truth, e.g. stellar
parameters, is know in GeDR3mock, it can be used to construct priors as well as
mock data tests for parameter estimation.
  All code, models and data used to produce GeDR3mock are linked and contained
in galaxia_wrap, a python package, representing a fast galactic forward model,
able to project MW models and N-body data into realistic Gaia observables.

  Shape Representation Learning","  Demand for efficient 3D shape representation learning is increasing in many
3D computer vision applications. The recent success of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from
CNN to 3D shapes. However, unlike images that are Euclidean structured, 3D
shape data are irregular since each node's neighbors are inconsistent. Various
convolutional graph neural networks for 3D shapes have been developed using
isotropic filters or using anisotropic filters with predefined local coordinate
systems to overcome the node inconsistency on graphs. However, isotropic
filters or predefined local coordinate systems limit the representation power.
In this paper, we propose a permutable anisotropic convolutional operation
(PAI-Conv) that learns adaptive soft-permutation matrices for each node
according to the geometric shape of its neighbors and performs shared
anisotropic filters as CNN does. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our
model produces significant improvement in 3D shape reconstruction compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

binary neutron stars (BNSs) with the LIGO and Virgo detectors,
neutron-star--black-holes (NSBHs) are the natural next class of binary systems
to be observed. In this work, we develop a waveform model for aligned-spin
neutron-star--black-holes (NSBHs) combining a binary black-hole baseline
waveform (available in the effective-one-body approach) with a phenomenological
description of tidal effects (extracted from numerical-relativity simulations),
and correcting the amplitude during the late inspiral, merger and ringdown to
account for the NS's tidal disruption. In particular, we calibrate the
amplitude corrections using NSBH waveforms obtained with the
numerical-relativity spectral Einstein code (SpEC) and the SACRA code. Based on
the simulations used, and on checking that sensible waveforms are produced, we
recommend our model to be employed with NS's mass in the range $1-3 M_\odot$,
tidal deformability $0\mbox{-}5000$, and (dimensionless) BH's spin magnitude up
to $0.9$. We also validate our model against two new, highly accurate NSBH
waveforms with BH's spin 0.9 and mass ratios 3 and 4, characterized by tidal
disruption, produced with SpEC, and find very good agreement. Furthermore, we
compute the unfaithfulness between waveforms from NSBH, BBH, and BNS systems,
finding that it will be challenging for the advanced LIGO-Virgo--detector
network at design sensitivity to distinguish different source classes. We
perform a Bayesian parameter-estimation analysis on a synthetic
numerical-relativity signal in zero noise to study parameter biases. Finally,
we reanalyze GW170817, with the hypothesis that it is a NSBH. We do not find
evidence to distinguish the BNS and NSBH hypotheses, however the posterior for
the mass ratio is shifted to less equal masses under the NSBH hypothesis.

chronic diseases. Given the high prevalence of sedentary behavior in daily
life, light-weight solutions for behavior change are needed to avoid
detrimental health effects. The mobile app SedVis was developed based on the
Health Action Process Approach. The app provides personal mobility pattern
visualization (for both physical activity and sedentary behavior) and action
planning for sedentary behavior change. The primary aim of the study was to
investigate the effect of mobility visualization on users' action planning for
changing their sedentary behavior. The secondary aim was to evaluate user
engagement with the visualization and user experience of the app. A three-week
pilot study was conducted with 16 participants who had the motivation to reduce
their sedentary behavior. The results showed that the visualizations in SedVis
had no statistically significant effect on the participants' action planning.
The intervention involving the visualizations and action planning in SedVis had
a positive effect on reducing participants' sedentary hours with weak evidence
(mean -0.40, SD 0.63), while the active control condition did not decrease
sedentary time (mean 0.17, SD 1.65). The results also suggested that the more
frequently the users checked the app, the more they might reduce their
sedentary behavior; however, this finding did not reach statistical
significance. The visualizations in the app also led to higher user-perceived
novelty. No participant complained about the interruption, while some
participants commented that making action plans every day was boring. Using a
smartphone app to collect mobility data and provide feedback in real-time using
visualizations might be a promising method to induce changes in sedentary
behavior and might be more effective than action planning alone.

were recently discovered to be active catalysts in photocatalytic water

the water structure in the vicinity of the nanoparticle surface with the
photocatalytic activity of these materials in light induced proton reduction.
The results presented herein allow to explain the catalytic activity of these
Weyl semimetals: the most active material, NbP, exhibits a particularly low
water coordination near the surface of the nanoparticle, whereas for
1T-TaS$_2$, with the lowest catalytic activity, the water structure at the
surface is most ordered. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of several
organic and metalorganic photosensitizers in the hydrogen evolution reaction
was experimentally investigated with NbP as proton reduction catalyst.
Unexpectedly, the charge of the photosensitizer plays a decisive role for the
photocatalytic performance.

fusion between features on social media, especially between posts and comments.
Generally, in fake news, there are emotional associations and semantic
conflicts between posts and comments. How to represent and fuse the
cross-interaction between both is a key challenge. In this paper, we propose
Adaptive Interaction Fusion Networks (AIFN) to fulfill cross-interaction fusion
among features for fake news detection. In AIFN, to discover semantic

combining the low (~2000 $k_{B}{\mu}m^{-2}$) electronic specific heat of high
mobility (> 50000 $cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}$) hBN-encapsulated graphene with the
asymmetric field-enhancement produced by a bow-tie antenna resonating at 3 THz.
This produces a strong photo-thermoelectric conversion, which simultaneously
leads to a combination of high sensitivity (NEP $\leq$ 160 $pWHz^{-1/2}$), fast
response time ($\leq 3.3 ns$) and a four orders of magnitude dynamic range,
making our devices the fastest, broadband, low noise, room temperature THz PD
to date.

that produce a signal appearing solely or primarily in a single detector. Past
analyses have heavily relied on coincidence between multiple detectors to
reduce non-astrophysical background. However, for $\sim40\%$ of the total time
of the 2015-2017 LIGO-Virgo observing runs only a single detector was
operating. We discuss the difficulties in assigning significance and
calculating the probability of astrophysical origin for candidates observed
primarily by a single detector, and suggest a straightforward resolution using
a noise model designed to provide a conservative assessment given the observed
data. We also describe a procedure to assess candidates observed in a single
detector when multiple detectors are observing. We apply these methods to
search for binary black hole (BBH) and binary neutron star (BNS) mergers in the
open LIGO data spanning 2015-2017. The most promising candidate from our search
is 170817+03:02:46UTC (probability of astrophysical origin $p_{\rm astro} \sim
0.4$): if astrophysical, this is consistent with a BBH merger with primary mass
$67_{-15}^{+21}\,M_{\odot}$, suggestive of a hierarchical merger origin. We
also apply our method to the analysis of GW190425 and find $p_{\rm astro} \sim
0.5$, though this value is highly dependent on assumptions about the noise and

source dataset to make predictions on an unlabeled target dataset by aligning
the two data distributions. In robotics, DA is used to take advantage of
automatically generated synthetic data, that come with ""free"" annotation, to
make effective predictions on real data. However, existing DA methods are not
designed to cope with the multi-modal nature of RGB-D data, which are widely
used in robotic vision. We propose a novel RGB-D DA method that reduces the
synthetic-to-real domain shift by exploiting the inter-modal relation between
the RGB and depth image. Our method consists of training a convolutional neural
network to solve, in addition to the main recognition task, the pretext task of
predicting the relative rotation between the RGB and depth image. To evaluate
our method and encourage further research in this area, we define two benchmark
datasets for object categorization and instance recognition. With extensive
experiments, we show the benefits of leveraging the inter-modal relations for
RGB-D DA.

  Estimation and Pilot Design for Large-Scale MIMO Systems","  The doubly selective (DS) channel estimation in the large-scale
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is a challenging problem due to
the large number of the channel coefficients to be estimated, which requires
unaffordable and prohibitive pilot overhead. In this paper, firstly we conduct
the analysis about the common sparsity of the basis expansion model (BEM)
coefficients among all the BEM orders and all the transmit-receive antenna
pairs. Then a novel pilot pattern is proposed, which inserts the guard pilots
to deal with the inter carrier interference (ICI) under the superimposed pilot
pattern. Moreover, by exploiting the common sparsity of the BEM coefficients
among different BEM orders and different antennas, we propose a block
distributed compressive sensing (BDCS) based DS channel estimator for the
large-scale MIMO systems. Its structured sparsity leads to the reduction of the
pilot overhead under the premise of guaranteeing the accuracy of the
estimation. Furthermore, taking consideration of the block structure, a pilot
design algorithm referred to as block discrete stochastic optimization (BDSO)
is proposed. It optimizes the pilot positions by reducing the coherence among
different blocks of the measurement matrix. Besides, a linear smoothing method
is extended to large-scale MIMO systems to improve the accuracy of the
estimation. Simulation results verify the performance gains of our proposed
estimator and the pilot design algorithm compared with the existing schemes.

likely, artifacts of applying a biologically substantiated transfer function,
the underlying solar input signal with a dominant 11.04 years periodicity can
well be considered as mainly phase-coherent over the 1000 years period in the
early Holocene. For more recent times, we show that the re-introduction of a
hypothesized ""lost cycle"" at the beginning of the Dalton minimum would lead to
a real phase jump. Similarly, by analyzing various series of $^{14}$C and
$^{10}$Be data and comparing them with Schove's historical cycle maxima, we
support the existence of another ""lost cycle"" around 1565, also connected with
a phase jump. Viewed synoptically, our results lend greater plausibility to the

undergo phase jumps, although the competing explanation in terms of a
self-synchronizing solar dynamo cannot be completely ruled out.

generalizes function-free Horn rules by allowing existentially quantified
variables in rule heads. This family of languages has recently attracted
significant interest in the context of ontology-mediated query answering.
Forward chaining, also known as the chase, is a fundamental tool for computing
universal models of knowledge bases, which consist of existential rules and
facts. Several chase variants have been defined, which differ on the way they
handle redundancies. A set of existential rules is bounded if it ensures the
existence of a bound on the depth of the chase, independently from any set of
facts. Deciding if a set of rules is bounded is an undecidable problem for all
chase variants. Nevertheless, when computing universal models, knowing that a
set of rules is bounded for some chase variant does not help much in practice
if the bound remains unknown or even very large. Hence, we investigate the
decidability of the k-boundedness problem, which asks whether the depth of the
chase for a given set of rules is bounded by an integer k. We identify a
general property which, when satisfied by a chase variant, leads to the
decidability of k-boundedness. We then show that the main chase variants
satisfy this property, namely the oblivious, semi-oblivious (aka Skolem), and
restricted chase, as well as their breadth-first versions. This paper is under
consideration for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming.

increases in the presence of positive Gauss-Bonnet parameter. Finally, we show
how the magnetic interaction and Gauss-Bonnet parameter may mimic the effect of

non-thermal radiative model for the wind-collision region. We establish a
conservative upper limit for the fraction of the wind kinetic power that is
converted into relativistic electron acceleration, $f_\mathrm{NT,e} < 0.02$. In
addition, we set a lower limit for the magnetic field in the wind-collision

  HPC:The Global Virtual Time Case","  High-performance computing on shared-memory/multi-core architectures could
suffer from non-negligible performance bottlenecks due to coordination
algorithms, which are nevertheless necessary to ensure the overall correctness
and/or to support the execution of housekeeping operations, e.g. to recover
computing resources (e.g., memory). Although more complex in
design/development, a paradigm switch from classical coordination algorithms to
wait-free ones could significantly boost the performance of HPC applications.
  In this paper we explore the relevance of this paradigm shift in
shared-memory architectures, by focusing on the context of Parallel Discrete
Event Simulation, where the Global Virtual Time (GVT) represents a fundamental
coordination algorithm. It allows to compute the lower bound on the value of
the logical time passed through by all the entities participating in a
parallel/distributed computation. Hence it can be used to discriminate what
events belong to the past history of the computation---thus being considered as
committed---and allowing for memory recovery (e.g. of obsolete logs that were
taken in order to support state recoverability) and non-revokable operations
(e.g. I/O).
  We compare the reference (blocking) algorithm for shared memory, the one
proposed by by Fujimoto and Hybinette \cite{Fuj97}, with an innovative
wait-free implementation, emphasizing on what design choices must be made to
enforce this paradigm shift, and what are the performance implications of
removing critical sections in coordination algorithms.

query on the other hand. Over the past two decades, a significant body of works
has advanced technical retrieval prowess while several studies have shed light
on issues pertaining to human search behavior. We believe that these efforts
should be conjoined, in the sense that automated retrieval systems have to
fully emulate human search behavior and thus consider the procedure according
to which users incrementally enhance their initial query. To this end,
cognitive reformulation patterns that mimic user search behaviour are
highlighted and enhancement terms which are statistically collocated with or
lexical-semantically related to the original terms adopted in the retrieval
process. We formalize the application of these patterns by considering a query
conceptual representation and introducing a set of operations allowing to
operate modifications on the initial query. A genetic algorithm-based weighting
process allows placing emphasis on terms according to their conceptual
role-type. An experimental evaluation on real-world datasets against relevance,
language, conceptual and knowledge-based models is conducted. We also show,
when compared to language and relevance models, a better performance in terms

(one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many). Specifically, in our
model, a relation is a linear function of two low-dimensional vector-presented
entities with two weight vectors and a bias vector. Since the vectors are
defined in a real number space and the scoring function of the model is linear,
our model is simple and scalable to large KGs. Experimental results on four
datasets show that the proposed LineaRE significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models for link prediction task.

  plasma turbulence in numerical simulations","  Turbulent space and astrophysical plasmas exhibit a complex dynamics, which
involves nonlinear coupling across different temporal and spatial scales. There
is growing evidence that impulsive events, such as magnetic reconnection
instabilities, lead to a spatially localized enhancement of energy dissipation,
thus speeding up the energy transfer at small scales. Capturing such a diverse
dynamics is challenging. Here, we employ the Multidimensional Iterative
Filtering (MIF) method, a novel technique for the analysis of nonstationary
multidimensional signals. Unlike other traditional methods (e.g., based on
Fourier or wavelet decomposition), MIF does not require any previous assumption
on the functional form of the signal to be identified. Using MIF, we carry out
a multiscale analysis of Hall-magnetohydrodynamic (HMHD) and hybrid
particle-in-cell (HPIC) numerical simulations of decaying plasma turbulence.
The results assess the ability of MIF to spatially identify and separate the
different scales (the MHD inertial range, the sub-ion kinetic, and the
dissipation scales) of the plasma dynamics. Furthermore, MIF decomposition
allows to detect localized current structures and to characterize their
contribution to the statistical and spectral properties of turbulence. Overall,
MIF arises as a very promising technique for the study of turbulent plasma
environments.

  model","  We study the effect of the early kinetic decoupling in a model of fermionic
dark matter (DM) that interacts with the standard model particles only by
exchanging the Higgs boson. There are two DM-Higgs couplings, namely
CP-conserving and CP-violating couplings. If the mass of the DM is slightly
below half of the Higgs boson mass, then the couplings are suppressed to obtain
the measured value of the DM energy density by the freeze-out mechanism. In
addition, the scattering processes of DM off particles in the thermal bath are
suppressed by the small momentum transfer if the CP-violating DM-Higgs coupling
is larger than the CP-conserving one. Due to the suppression, the temperature
of the DM can differ from the temperature of the thermal bath. By solving
coupled equations for the number density and temperature of the DM, we
calculate the DM-Higgs couplings that reproduce the right amount of the DM
relic abundance. We find that the couplings have to be larger than the one
obtained without taking into account the difference in the temperatures. A
consequence of the enhancement of the DM-Higgs couplings is the enhancement of
the Higgs invisible decay branching ratio. The enhancement is testable at
current and future collider experiments.

increase optimization difficulty, e.g., shift for anti centering effect and
rotation for anti dimension sensitivity. Despite testing the transformation
invariance, however, such operations do not really change the landscape's
""shape"", but rather than change the ""view point"". For instance, after rotated,
ill conditional problems are turned around in terms of orientation but still
keep proportional components, which, to some extent, does not create much
obstacle in optimization. In this paper, inspired from image processing, we
investigate a novel graphic conformal mapping transformation on benchmark
problems to deform the function shape. The bending operation does not alter the
function basic properties, e.g., a unimodal function can almost maintain its
unimodality after bent, but can modify the shape of interested area in the
search space. Experiments indicate the same optimizer spends more search budget
and encounter more failures on the conformal bent functions than the rotated
version. Several parameters of the proposed function are also analyzed to
reveal performance sensitivity of the evolutionary algorithms.

texture and visual features serving human visual perception and machine
intelligence respectively, much less work has been dedicated to studying the
interactions between them. Here we investigate the integration of feature and

information representation can be achieved in a hierarchical way. In
particular, we study the feature and texture compression in a scalable coding

enhancement layer targets to perfectly reconstruct the texture. Based on the
strong generative capability of deep neural networks, the gap between the base
feature layer and enhancement layer is further filled with the feature level
texture reconstruction, aiming to further construct texture representation from
feature. As such, the residuals between the original and reconstructed texture
could be further conveyed in the enhancement layer. To improve the efficiency
of the proposed framework, the base layer neural network is trained in a
multi-task manner such that the learned features enjoy both high quality
reconstruction and high accuracy analysis. We further demonstrate the framework
and optimization strategies in face image compression, and promising coding
performance has been achieved in terms of both rate-fidelity and rate-accuracy.

  by Evolutionary Optimization","  Achieving peak performance in a computer system requires optimizations in
every layer of the system, be it hardware or software. A detailed understanding
of the underlying hardware, and especially the processor, is crucial to
optimize software. One key criterion for the performance of a processor is its
ability to exploit instruction-level parallelism. This ability is determined by
the port mapping of the processor, which describes the execution units of the
processor for each instruction.
  Processor manufacturers usually do not share the port mappings of their
microarchitectures. While approaches to automatically infer port mappings from
experiments exist, they are based on processor-specific hardware performance
counters that are not available on every platform.
  We present PMEvo, a framework to automatically infer port mappings solely
based on the measurement of the execution time of short instruction sequences.
PMEvo uses an evolutionary algorithm that evaluates the fitness of candidate
mappings with an analytical throughput model formulated as a linear program.
Our prototype implementation infers a port mapping for Intel's Skylake
architecture that predicts measured instruction throughput with an accuracy
that is competitive to existing work. Furthermore, it finds port mappings for
AMD's Zen+ architecture and the ARM Cortex-A72 architecture, which are out of

  Relation Extraction","  Relation ties, defined as the correlation and mutual exclusion between
different relations, are critical for distant supervised relation extraction.
Existing approaches model this property by greedily learning local
dependencies. However, they are essentially limited by failing to capture the
global topology structure of relation ties. As a result, they may easily fall
into a locally optimal solution. To solve this problem, in this paper, we
propose a novel force-directed graph based relation extraction model to
comprehensively learn relation ties. Specifically, we first build a graph
according to the global co-occurrence of relations. Then, we borrow the idea of
Coulomb's Law from physics and introduce the concept of attractive force and
repulsive force to this graph to learn correlation and mutual exclusion between
relations. Finally, the obtained relation representations are applied as an
inter-dependent relation classifier. Experimental results on a large scale
benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model is capable of modeling global
relation ties and significantly outperforms other baselines. Furthermore, the
proposed force-directed graph can be used as a module to augment existing
relation extraction systems and improve their performance.

(BP), can effectively compute the marginal posteriors. Nonetheless, it is still
difficult to interpret the inference outcomes for important human decision
making. There is no existing method to rigorously attribute the inference
outcomes to the contributing factors of the graphical models. Shapley values
provide an axiomatic framework, but naively computing or even approximating the

GraphShapley to integrate the decomposability of Shapley values, the structure

  application to the string percolation model","  In string percolation model, the study of colliding systems at high energies
is based on a continuum percolation theory in two dimensions where the number
of strings distributed in the surface of interest is strongly determined by the
size and the energy of the colliding particles. It is also expected that the
surface where the disks are lying be finite, defining a system without periodic
boundary conditions. In this work, we report modifications to the fraction of
the area covered by disks in continuum percolating systems due to a finite
number of disks and bounded by different geometries: circle, ellipse, triangle,
square and pentagon, which correspond to the first Fourier modes of the shape
fluctuation of the initial state after the particle collision. We find that the
deviation of the fraction of area covered by disks from its corresponding value
in the thermodynamic limit satisfies a universal behavior, where the free
parameters depend on the density profile, number of disks and the shape of the
boundary. Consequently, it is also found that the color suppression factor of
the string percolation model is modified by a damping function related to the
small-bounded effects. Corrections to the temperature and the speed of sound

component and sparse component from multidimensional data, which has been used
successfully in several image applications. Its performance varies with
different kinds of tensor decompositions, and the tensor singular value
decomposition (t-SVD) is a popularly selected one. The standard t-SVD takes the
discrete Fourier transform to exploit the residual in the 3rd mode in the
decomposition. When minimizing the tensor nuclear norm related to t-SVD, all
the frontal slices in frequency domain are optimized equally. In this paper, we
incorporate frequency component analysis into t-SVD to enhance the RTPCA
performance. Specially, different frequency bands are unequally weighted with
respect to the corresponding physical meanings, and the frequency-weighted
tensor nuclear norm can be obtained. Accordingly we rigorously deduce the
frequency-weighted tensor singular value threshold operator, and apply it for
low rank approximation subproblem in RTPCA. The newly obtained
frequency-weighted RTPCA can be solved by alternating direction method of
multipliers, and it is the first time that frequency analysis is taken in
tensor principal component analysis. Numerical experiments on synthetic 3D
data, color image denoising and background modeling verify that the proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms both in accuracy and
computational complexity.

  of thick, hydrated organic materials (revised)","  Electron and x-ray microscopes allow one to image the entire, unlabeled
structure of hydrated materials at a resolution well beyond what visible light
microscopes can achieve. However, both approaches involve ionizing radiation,
so that radiation damage must be considered as one of the limits to imaging.
Drawing upon earlier work, we describe here a unified approach to estimating
the image contrast (and thus the required exposure and corresponding radiation
dose) in both x-ray and electron microscopy. This approach accounts for factors
such as plural and inelastic scattering, and (in electron microscopy) the use
of energy filters to obtain so-called ""zero loss"" images. As expected, it shows
that electron microscopy offers lower dose for specimens thinner than about 1
micron (such as for studies of macromolecules, viruses, bacteria and
archaebacteria, and thin sectioned material), while x-ray microscopy offers
superior characteristics for imaging thicker specimen such as whole eukaryotic
cells, thick-sectioned tissues, and organs. The required radiation dose scales
strongly as a function of the desired spatial resolution, allowing one to
understand the limits of live and frozen hydrated specimen imaging. Finally, we
consider the factors limiting x-ray microscopy of thicker materials, suggesting
that specimens as thick as a whole mouse brain can be imaged with x-ray
microscopes without significant image degradation should appropriate image
reconstruction methods be identified. The as-published article [Ultramicroscopy

destroying the crystalline symmetries, as opposed to the 2D BCSMs caused by the
accidental band crossing. Through group theory analysis, we find that 2D SSP
BCSMs can only exist at the K (K') point of Brillouin zone (BZ) of four layer
groups and identify nonmagnetic 2D FeB2 as a candidate. Interestingly,
nonmagnetic 2D SSP BCSMs can host a single pair of band crossing points (BCPs),
whereas nonmagnetic three-dimensional (3D) Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have at least
two pairs of band crossing Weyl points. It is found that the single pair of
BCPs are robust against any kinds of strain. Furthermore, our calculation

temperature gradient driven plasma instability that leads to fine scale tearing
of the magnetic flux surfaces thereby resulting in reconnection of magnetic
field lines and formation of magnetic islands. In slab geometry it has
previously been shown that the drive mechanism requires a finite collision
frequency. However, recent gyrokinetic simulations in toroidal systems have
found a microtearing mode existing at low and zero collision frequency. It is
shown here that linear gyrokinetic simulations can demonstrate a collisionless
fine-scale tearing parity instability even in slab geometry. Detailed studies
reveal that these slab modes are sensitive to electron finite Larmor radius
effects, and have a radial wavenumber much smaller than the binormal
wavenumber, which is comparable to the ion Larmor radius. Furthermore, they
exist even in the electrostatic limit and electromagnetic effects actually have
a stabilising influence on this collisionless tearing mode. An analytic model
shows that this collisionless small scale tearing mode is consistent with a
tearing parity slab electron temperature gradient (ETG) mode, which can be more
unstable than the twisting parity ETG mode that is often studied. This
small-scale tearing parity mode can lead to magnetic islands, which, in turn,
can influence turbulent transport in magnetised plasmas.

  Clinical Trials","  Imbalance in baseline characteristics due to chance is common in randomized
clinical trials. Regression adjustment such as the analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) is often used to account for imbalance and increase precision of the
treatment effect estimate. An objective alternative is through inverse
probability weighting (IPW) of the propensity scores. Although IPW and ANCOVA
are asymptotically equivalent, the former may demonstrate inferior performance
in finite samples. In this article, we point out that IPW is a special case of
the general class of balancing weights, and propose the overlap weighting (OW)
method for covariate adjustment. The OW approach has a unique advantage of
completely removing chance imbalance when the propensity score is estimated by
logistic regression. We show that the OW estimator attains the same
semiparametric variance lower bound as the most efficient ANCOVA estimator and
the IPW estimator with a continuous outcome, and derive closed-form variance
estimators for OW when estimating additive and ratio estimands. Through
extensive simulations, we demonstrate OW consistently outperforms IPW in finite
samples and improves the efficiency over ANCOVA and augmented IPW when the
degree of treatment effect heterogeneity is moderate or when the outcome model
is incorrectly specified. We apply the proposed OW estimator to the Best Apnea
Interventions for Research (BestAIR) randomized trial to evaluate the effect of
continuous positive airway pressure on patient health outcomes.

multi-intent SLU faces an unique challenges: how to effectively incorporate
multiple intents information to guide the slot prediction. In this paper, we
propose a Token-level Dynamic Graph-Interactive Network (TD-GIN) for joint

With graph interaction mechanism, our framework has the advantage to
automatically extract the relevant intents information to guide each token slot

maximizing the marginal likelihood. Bayesian optimization is a popular
iterative method where a Gaussian process posterior of the underlying function
is sequentially updated by new function evaluations. An acquisition strategy
uses this posterior distribution to decide where to place the next function
evaluation. We propose a novel Bayesian optimization framework for situations
where the user controls the computational effort, and therefore the precision
of the function evaluations. This is a common situation in econometrics where
the marginal likelihood is often computed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods, with the precision of the marginal likelihood estimate determined by
the number of MCMC draws. The proposed acquisition strategy gives the optimizer
the option to explore the function with cheap noisy evaluations and therefore
finds the optimum faster. Prior hyperparameter estimation in the steady-state
Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model on US macroeconomic time series
data is used for illustration. The proposed method is shown to find the optimum
much quicker than traditional Bayesian optimization or grid search.

protoplanetary discs. In a recent first, an azimuthally elongated AU-scale
blob, possibly a planet, was resolved with ALMA in TW Hya. The blob is at the
edge of a cliff-like rollover in the dust disc rather than inside a dark ring.
Here we build time-dependent models of TW Hya disc. We find that the classical
paradigm cannot account for the morphology of the disc and the blob. We propose
that ALMA-discovered blob hides a Neptune mass planet losing gas and dust. We
show that radial drift of mm-sized dust particles naturally explains why the
blob is located on the edge of the dust disc. Dust particles leaving the planet
perform a characteristic U-turn relative to it, producing an azimuthally
elongated blob-like emission feature. This scenario also explains why a 10 Myr
old disc is so bright in dust continuum. Two scenarios for the dust-losing
planet are presented. In the first, a dusty pre-runaway gas envelope of about
40 Earth mass Core Accretion planet is disrupted, e.g., as a result of a
catastrophic encounter. In the second, a massive dusty pre-collapse gas giant
planet formed by Gravitational Instability is disrupted by the energy released
in its massive core. Future modelling may discriminate between these scenarios
and allow us to study planet formation in an entirely new way -- by analysing
the flows of dust and gas recently belonging to planets, informing us about the

  Utilities in Incomplete Markets","  This paper establishes a new decomposition of optimal dynamic portfolio
choice under general incomplete-market diffusion models by disentangling the
fundamental impacts on optimal policy from market incompleteness and flexible
wealth-dependent utilities. We derive explicit dynamics of the components for
the optimal policy, and obtain an equation system for solving the shadow price
of market incompleteness, which is found to be dependent on both market state
and wealth level. We identify a new important hedge component for non-myopic
investors to hedge the uncertainty in shadow price due to variation in wealth
level. As an application, we establish and compare the decompositions of
optimal policy under general models with the prevalent HARA and CRRA utilities.
Under nonrandom but possibly time-varying interest rate, we solve in
closed-form the HARA policy as a combination of a bond holding scheme and a
corresponding CRRA strategy. Finally, we develop a simulation method to
implement the decomposition of optimal policy under the general incomplete
market setting, whereas existing approaches remain elusive.

the cosmic origin of the first 21cm detections. As some of the widest fields
available, comprising thousands of sources with reasonably known redshifts,
narrow-band Lyman alpha emitter (LAE) surveys are an obvious choice for such
cross-correlation. Here we revisit the 21cm -- LAE cross-correlation, relaxing
the common assumption of reionization occurring in a pre-heated intergalactic
medium (IGM). Using specifications from the Square Kilometre Array and the
Subary Hyper Supreme-Cam, we present new forecasts of the 21cm -- LAE
cross-correlation function at $z\sim7$. We sample a broad parameter space of
the mean IGM neutral fraction and spin temperature, ($\bar{x}_{\rm{HI}}$,
$\bar{T}_{\rm S}$). The sign of the cross-correlation roughly follows the sign
of the 21cm signal: ionized regions which surround LAEs correspond to relative
hot spots in the 21cm signal when the neutral IGM is colder than the CMB, and
relative cold spots when the neutral IGM is hotter than the CMB. The amplitude
of the cross-correlation function generally increases with increasing
$\bar{x}_{\rm{HI}}$, following the increasing bias of the cosmic HII regions.
As is the case for 21cm, the strongest cross signal occurs when the IGM is
colder than the CMB, providing a large contrast between the neutral regions and
the ionized regions which host LAEs. We also vary the topology of reionization
and the epoch of X-ray heating. The cross-correlation during the first half of
reionization is sensitive to these topologies, and could thus be used to
constrain them.

for simplicity, regardless of how complex the incoming task is. Instead, we
propose a principled Bayesian nonparametric approach based on the Indian Buffet
Process (IBP) prior, letting the data determine how much to expand the model
complexity. We pair this with a factorization of the neural network's weight

weight matrix to the complexity of the task, while the IBP prior imposes weight
factor sparsity and encourages factor reuse, promoting positive knowledge
transfer between tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a

We regard these searchers as Web searchers who are suspicious of their own

WSSCI are compared with the actual location of the known two clusters. [Result

confirm several WSSCI, which demonstrated the basic feasibility of our

was biased after the public announcement of the cluster development. For the
case where the other cluster-related resources, such as fine-grained population
statistics, are not available, the proposed metric would be helpful to catch
the hint of emerging clusters.

high-resolution N-body simulations. More specifically, we use the weak field
limit of two modified gravity theories, i.e., nonlocal gravity (NLG) and
scalar-tensor-vector gravity known as MOG, and ignore the existence of dark
matter halo. On the other hand, we construct the same models in the standard
dark matter model and compare their dynamics with the galactic models in
modified gravity. It turns out that there are serious differences between
galactic models in these different viewpoints. For example, we explicitly show
that the galactic models in modified gravity, host faster bars compared to the
dark matter case. On the other hand, final stellar bars are weaker in modified
gravity. These facts are not new and have already been reported in our previous
simulations for exponential galactic models. Therefore, our main purpose in
this study is to show that the above-mentioned differences, with emphasis on
the speed of the bars, are independent of the initial density profile of the
adopted disk/halo. To do so, we employ different profiles for the disk and halo
and show that the results remain qualitatively independent of the initial
galactic models. Moreover, a more accurate method has been used to quantify the
kinematic properties of the stellar bar. Our results imply that contrary to the
dark matter models, bars in modified gravity are fast rotators which never
leave the fast-bar region until the end of the simulation.

$\gamma$-ray bursts and BNS mergers. It also confirmed the forging of heavy
elements in the ejecta (a so-called kilonova) via the r-process
nucleosynthesis. The appearance of non-thermal radio and X-ray emission, as
well as the brightening, which lasted more than 100 days, were somewhat
unexpected. Current theoretical models attempt to explain this temporal
behavior as either originating from a relativistic off-axis jet or a
kilonova-like outflow. In either scenario, there is some ambiguity regarding
how much energy is transported in the non-thermal electrons versus the magnetic
field of the emission region. Combining the VLA (radio) and Chandra (X-ray)
measurements with observations in the GeV-TeV domain can help break this
ambiguity, almost independently of the assumed origin of the emission. Here we

to elucidate the balance between investments in telescope time versus
scientific yield. We use the supervised machine learning method of the random
forest to perform an information content analysis on a 11-parameter model of
transmission spectra from the various NIRSpec modes. The three bluest
medium-resolution NIRSpec modes (0.7 - 1.27 microns, 0.97 - 1.84 microns, 1.66
- 3.07 microns) are insensitive to the presence of CO. The reddest
medium-resolution mode (2.87 - 5.10 microns) is sensitive to all of the
molecules assumed in our model: CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, H2O, HCN and NH3. It
competes effectively with the three bluest modes on the information encoded on
cloud abundance and particle size. It is also competitive with the
low-resolution prism mode (0.6 - 5.3 microns) on the inference of every
parameter except for the temperature and ammonia abundance. We recommend
astronomers to use the reddest medium-resolution NIRSpec mode for studying the
atmospheric chemistry of 800-1200 K warm Neptunes; its corresponding
high-resolution counterpart offers diminishing returns. We compare our findings
to previous JWST information content analyses that favor the blue orders, and
suggest that the reliance on chemical equilibrium could lead to biased outcomes
if this assumption does not apply. A simple, pressure-independent diagnostic
for identifying chemical disequilibrium is proposed based on measuring the
abundances of H2O, CO and CO2.

between 1 AGeV and 2 AGeV. We compare and validate two different methods to
extract the yields of $\Delta$(1232) resonances in such low energy nuclear
collisions: Firstly, the $\pi^-$ spectra at low $p_\mathrm{T}$ are used to
infer the $\Delta$(1232) yield in A+A collisions, a method employed by the
GSI/FOPI experiment. Secondly, we employ the invariant mass method used by the
HADES collaboration, which has recently reported data in the
$\Delta^{++}\rightarrow\pi^++p$ channel. We show that both methods are
compatible with each other and with the theoretical calculations, indicating
that the new HADES results are compatible with the previous FOPI measurements.
Then we use the $\Delta/nucleon$ ratio to extract the kinetic decoupling
temperatures of the $\Delta$(1232) resonances. We find that the extracted
temperatures are consistent with the predicted mass shift of the $\Delta$
resonance and the freeze-out parameters estimated from complementary studies
(blast wave fits, coarse graining).

transfer rates rely on integrals over wavenumber triads $(\textbf{k,p,q})$
satisfying $\textbf{k+p+q=0}$. As an example $S_E^{uu}(\textbf{k|p,q})$ denotes
the kinetic energy transfer rate to the mode $\textbf{k}$, from the two other
modes in the triad, $\textbf{p}$ and $\textbf{q}$. As noted by Kraichnan
(1958), in $S_E^{uu}(\textbf{k|p,q})$, what fraction of the energy transferred
to the mode $\textbf{k}$ originated from $\textbf{p}$ and which from
$\textbf{q}$ is unknown . Such an expression is thus incongruent with the
customary description of turbulence in terms of two-scale energy exchange.
Notwithstanding this issue, Dar etal. (2001) further decomposed these transfers
into separate contributions from $\textbf{p}$-to-$\textbf{k}$ and
$\textbf{q}$-to-$\textbf{k}$, thus introducing the concept of mode-to-mode
transfers that they applied to MHD turbulence. Doing so, they had to set aside
additional transfers circulating within each triad, but failed to calculate
them.
  In the present paper we explain how to derive the complete expressions of the
mode-to-mode transfers, including the circulating transfers. We do it for
kinetic energy and kinetic helicity in hydrodynamic turbulence, for kinetic
energy, magnetic energy and magnetic helicity in MHD turbulence. Separating the
contribution of magnetic advection from magnetic stretching, the energy
mode-to-mode transfer rates involving the magnetic field become uniquely
defined, in striking contrast to the hydrodynamic case. The magnetic helicity
mode-to-mode transfer rate is also found to be uniquely defined, contrary to
kinetic helicity in hydrodynamics. We find that shell-to-shell transfer rates
have the same properties as mode-to-mode transfer rates. Finally calculating
the fluxes, we show how the circulating transfers cancel in accordance with
conservation laws.

treatments. Our goal is to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects among
patients. Traditionally, one can fit standard regressions in which models for
the main effect and the treatment effects are specified. However,
mis-specification of either the main or the treatment effects could severely
undermine the estimation. A set of recent proposals directly estimate the
treatment effect, avoiding the potential mis-specification issue for the main
effect. However, performance of these methods rely on either a known or
accurate estimator of the propensity score. In this paper, we propose a doubly
robust direct learning method (RD-Learning) to estimate the treatment effect.
The double robustness comes form the fact that it is robust to the two issues
of (1) main effect mis-specification and (2) inaccurate propensity score
estimates. As long as these two do not occur at the same time, our estimate is
consistent and has a smaller variance than competing methods. It can be used in
both the binary and the multi-arm settings. As a by-product, we develop a
competitive statistical inference tool for the treatment effect, assuming the
propensity score is known. We provide theoretical insights to the proposed
method using risk bounds under both linear and non-linear settings. Our method
is further demonstrated by simulation studies and a real data example.

antisymmetric tensor field, known as Kalb-Ramond (KR) field, on cosmological
particle production as well as on quantum entanglement for a massive scalar
field propagating in a four dimensional FRW spacetime evolves through a
symmetric bounce. For this purpose, the scalar field is considered to be
coupled with the KR field and also with the Ricci scalar via the term $\sim \xi
R\Phi^2$ (with $\xi$ be the coupling). The presence of KR field spoils the
conformal symmetry of a massless scalar field even for $\xi = 1/6$ in four
dimensional context, which has interesting consequences on particle production
and consequently on quantum entanglement as we will discuss. In particular, the
presence of KR field in a FRW bouncing universe allows a greater particle
production and consequently the upper bound of the entanglement entropy becomes
larger in comparison to the case when the KR field is absent. This may provide
an interesting testbed for the existence of Kalb-Ramond field in our universe.

if the Ricci curvature of $N$ is positive then the minmax Allen--Cahn solutions
concentrate around a multiplicity-$1$ hypersurface, that may have a singular

of the solutions. As immediate corollary we obtain that every closed Riemannian

two-sided closed minimal hypersurface, possibly with a singular set of

  Image Data","  Purpose. Localizing structures and estimating the motion of a specific target
region are common problems for navigation during surgical interventions.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality with a high spatial
and temporal resolution that has been used for intraoperative imaging and also
for motion estimation, for example, in the context of ophthalmic surgery or
cochleostomy. Recently, motion estimation between a template and a moving OCT
image has been studied with deep learning methods to overcome the shortcomings
of conventional, feature-based methods.
  Methods. We investigate whether using a temporal stream of OCT image volumes
can improve deep learning-based motion estimation performance. For this
purpose, we design and evaluate several 3D and 4D deep learning methods and we
propose a new deep learning approach. Also, we propose a temporal
regularization strategy at the model output.
  Results. Using a tissue dataset without additional markers, our deep learning
methods using 4D data outperform previous approaches. The best performing 4D
architecture achieves an correlation coefficient (aCC) of 98.58% compared to
85.0% of a previous 3D deep learning method. Also, our temporal regularization
strategy at the output further improves 4D model performance to an aCC of
99.06%. In particular, our 4D method works well for larger motion and is robust
towards image rotations and motion distortions.
  Conclusions. We propose 4D spatio-temporal deep learning for OCT-based motion
estimation. On a tissue dataset, we find that using 4D information for the
model input improves performance while maintaining reasonable inference times.
Our regularization strategy demonstrates that additional temporal information
is also beneficial at the model output.

global Kato smoothing and Strichartz estimates for the solution to the

global Kato smoothing estimates for $e^{itH}$ are first established based on
the uniform resolvent estimates of Kato-Yajima type for the absolutely
continuous part of $H$. As a consequence, the optimal local decay estimates are
also obtained. Then, with the aid of such local decay estimates,the full set of
Strichartz estimates (including the endpoint case) have been proved. In
particular, we have obtained Strichartz estimates with sharp smoothing effects
for higher-order cases with rough potentials, which will be useful to the study
of nonlinear higher-order Schr\""odinger equations. Finally, we point out that
the new uniform Sobolev estimates of Kenig-Ruiz-Sogge type with extra

a one size fits all to a set of different slices where each slice is
responsible for specific network requirements. In the same light, the
micro-operator concept is targeted at local deployment of 5G for vertical
specific services. When a network slice instance (NSI) is created across the
access and core networks, it is important to understand how the communication
service from the created slice instance will be distributed to different
tenants and their end-users. In this vein, we propose a network slice
communication service distribution technique for local 5G micro-operator
deployment scenarios. This is achieved by expanding or leveraging the
communication service management function (CSMF) defined by 3GPP into a
multi-tenant manager and a communication services orchestrator. We further
describe how the communication service orchestrator will address all the
possible multitenant-slice situations that can exist during the distribution of
a network slice instance to multiple tenants. The generic technique introduced
in this paper will proffer a researchable solution for not only network slice
communication service distribution across different micro-operator tenants but
pave the way to support future use cases especially when the allocated slice is

Preventing hyperinflammation is key to avoiding this progression to severe
stages of COVID-19. We have previously demonstrated that alpha-1 adrenergic
receptor ($\alpha$1-AR) antagonists can prevent cytokine storms and resulting
death in mice. Here we present a retrospective study of outcomes in patients
with ARDS (n = 13,125) or pneumonia (n = 108,956). Patients who were taking
$\alpha$1-AR antagonists for other conditions had lower probability of needing
invasive mechanical ventilation and dying in the hospital compared to
non-users, both in ARDS (adjusted OR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.34-0.95, p = 0.021) and
in pneumonia (adjusted OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.94, p = 0.007). By contrast, no
significant effect was observed for beta-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$-AR)

trials of $\alpha$1-AR antagonists to assess their efficacy in preventing

model. We assume knowledge of the query dataset and the distribution of a
model's output activations. We establish statistical methods that compare the
outputs of the target with outputs of models trained with different datasets.
We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and
SVHN) and on a cardiac pathology diagnosis task using data from the Automated
Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC). We hope to encourage investigations on what
information a model retains and inspire extensions in more complex settings.

  Damaged Region using Grad-CAM","  Recent years, typhoon damages has become social problem owing to climate
change. Especially, 9 September 2019, Typhoon Faxai passed on the south Chiba
prefecture in Japan, whose damages included with electric and water provision
stop and house roof break because of strong wind recorded on the maximum 45
meter per second. A large amount of tree fell down, and the neighbor electric
poles also fell down at the same time. These disaster features have caused that
it took eighteen days for recovery longer than past ones. Initial responses are
important for faster recovery. As long as we can, aerial survey for global
screening of devastated region would be required for decision support to
respond where to recover ahead. This paper proposes a practical method to
visualize the damaged areas focused on the typhoon disaster features using
aerial photography. This method can classify eight classes which contains land
covers without damages and areas with disaster, where an aerial photograph is
partitioned into 4,096 grids that is 64 by 64, with each unit image of 48 meter
square. Using target feature class probabilities, we can visualize disaster
features map to scale the color range from blue to red or yellow. Furthermore,
we can realize disaster feature mapping on each unit grid images to compute the
convolutional activation map using Grad-CAM based on deep neural network layers
for classification. This paper demonstrates case studies applied to aerial
photographs recorded at the south Chiba prefecture in Japan after typhoon
disaster.

yields from the literature which are considered the best to reproduce the
abundance patterns in the solar vicinity. We find that in general the predicted
trends nicely reproduce the data but in some cases either the trend or the
absolute values of the predicted abundances need to be corrected, even by large
factors, in order to reach the best agreement. We suggest how the current
stellar yields should be modified to reproduce the data and we discuss whether
such corrections are reasonable in the light of the current knowledge of
stellar nucleosynthesis. However, we also critically discuss the observations.
Our results suggest that Si, Ca, Cr and Ni are the elements for which the
required corrections are the smallest, while for Mg and Al moderate
modifications are necessary. On the other hand, O and K need the largest
corrections to reproduce the observed patterns, a conclusion already reached
for solar vicinity abundance patterns, with the exception of oxygen. For Mn we
apply corrections already suggested in previous works. \end{abstract}

individuals, but real interactions are not random pairwise encounters : they
occur within clearly defined higher-order structures such as workplace,
households, schools, and concerts. We model contagion on networks with
higher-order structures using clique-based approximate master equations, in
which we track all states and interactions within a clique and assume a
mean-field coupling between them. Using the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible
dynamics, our approach allows us to show the existence of a mesoscopic
localization regime, where a disease can concentrate and self-sustain only
around large substructures in the network. In this regime, the phase transition
is smeared, characterized by an inhomogeneous activation of the various
higher-order structures. At the mesoscopic level, we observe that the
distribution of infected nodes within cliques of a same size can be very
dispersed, even bimodal. When considering networks heterogeneous both at the
level of nodes and cliques, we characterize analytically the region associated
with mesoscopic localization in the structural parameter space. We put in
perspective this phenomenon with eigenvector localization and discuss how a
focus on higher-level structures is needed to discern the more subtle
localization at the mesoscopic level. Finally, we discuss how mesoscopic
localization affects the response to structural interventions and how this
framework could provide important insights for a broad range of dynamics.

which interpolates between honeycomb lattice ($\alpha=0$) and dice lattice
($\alpha=1$), the Dirac cones move toward each other along a given direction,
merge and a gap opens while the flat band remains unchanged. Therefore, the
low-energy spectrum, along this merging direction, exhibits a transition from a
linear dispersion in the Dirac phase to a quadratic dispersion in the gapped
phase. However, along the perpendicular direction the spectrum remains linear.
Here we theoretically study the tunneling properties of particles through a
$\mathit{np}$ junction in deformed $\alpha-T_3$ lattice. In the Dirac phase, we
find that the tunneling properties are similar to those of undeformed
$\alpha-T_3$ lattice such as the perfect Klein tunneling at normal incidence
for all values of $\alpha$ and the total transparency of the junction, i.e. the
super-Klein tunneling, for $\alpha=1$ when the energy is equal to half of the
junction height. In the gapped phase, we obtain an opposite behavior when the
junction is oriented perpendicular to the deformation direction where the
perfect Klein tunneling turns into the anti-Klein tunneling effect for all
parameters $\alpha$ and the super-Klein tunneling effect transits to the
anti-super Klein tunneling effect, i.e. the junction is totally opaque.

amplitude motions is both central features in the fields of nuclear structure
and reactions. From a theoretical point of view, describing such phenomena
requires increasing the complexity of the many-body wavefunction of the system,
to account for long-range correlations. One of the challenges when going in
this direction is to keep the approach tractable within our current
computational resources while gaining the maximum of predictive power for the
phenomenon under study. In the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM), the many-body
wave function is a linear superposition of (generally non-orthogonal) many-body
states (the generator states) labeled by a few collective coordinates. Such a
method has been widely used in structure studies to restore the symmetries
broken by single-reference approaches. In the domain of reactions, its
time-dependent version (TDGCM) has been developed and applied to predict the
dynamics of heavy-ion collisions or fission where the collective fluctuations
play an essential role. In this review, we present the recent developments and
applications of the TDGCM in the context of nuclear reactions. We recall the
formal derivations of the TDGCM and its most common approximate treatment, the
Gaussian Overlap Approximation. We also emphasize the Schr\""odinger
Collective-Intrinsic Model (SCIM) variant focused on the inclusion of
quasiparticle excitations into the description. Finally, we highlight several

The CP domain wall profiles and tensions are obtained by numerically solving
the relevant field equations. The explicit CP violation terms are then
introduced to the potential as biased terms to make the domain walls unstable
and collapse, The BBN bound on the magnitude of the energy bias is taken into
account. To achieve sufficiently strong gravitational wave signals, the domain
wall tension $\sigma$ is required to be at least $\sigma/{\rm TeV}^3 \sim
\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. We find that the gravitational wave spectrum can be probed
in the future SKA and/or DECIGO programs, when the typical mass scale is at
least $\sim \mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV and the explicit CP violation terms are as
small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-29}) - \mathcal{O}(10^{-27}) $. The gravitational
waves from collapsing domain walls thus provide a complementarity to the probe
of extremely small CP violation at high-energy scale.

  expansion","  Relations between moments and cumulants play a central role in both classical
and non-commutative probability theory. The latter allows for several distinct
families of cumulants corresponding to different types of independences: free,
Boolean and monotone. Relations among those cumulants have been studied
recently. In this work we focus on the problem of expressing with a closed
formula multivariate monotone cumulants in terms of free and Boolean cumulants.
In the process we introduce various constructions and statistics on
non-crossing partitions. Our approach is based on a pre-Lie algebra structure
on cumulant functionals. Relations among cumulants are described in terms of
the pre-Lie Magnus expansion combined with results on the continuous
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula due to A. Murua.

  Libraries in Replicated Systems","  Geo-replicated systems provide a number of desirable properties such as
globally low latency, high availability, scalability, and built-in fault
tolerance. Unfortunately, programming correct applications on top of such
systems has proven to be very challenging, in large part because of the weak
consistency guarantees they offer. These complexities are exacerbated when we
try to adapt existing highly-performant concurrent libraries developed for
shared-memory environments to this setting. The use of these libraries,
developed with performance and scalability in mind, is highly desirable. But,
identifying a suitable notion of correctness to check their validity under a
weakly consistent execution model has not been well-studied, in large part
because it is problematic to naively transplant criteria such as
linearizability that has a useful interpretation in a shared-memory context to
a distributed one where the cost of imposing a (logical) global ordering on all
actions is prohibitive.
  In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing appropriate semantics and
specifications for highly-concurrent libraries in a weakly-consistent,
replicated setting. We use these specifications to develop a static analysis
framework that can automatically detect correctness violations of library
implementations parameterized with respect to the different consistency
policies provided by the underlying system. We use our framework to analyze the
behavior of a number of highly non-trivial library implementations of stacks,
queues, and exchangers. Our results provide the first demonstration that
automated correctness checking of concurrent libraries in a weakly
geo-replicated setting is both feasible and practical.

  laryngeal cancer detection","  Early detection of head and neck tumors is crucial for patient survival.
Often, diagnoses are made based on endoscopic examination of the larynx
followed by biopsy and histological analysis, leading to a high inter-observer
variability due to subjective assessment. In this regard, early non-invasive
diagnostics independent of the clinician would be a valuable tool. A recent
study has shown that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) can be used for non-invasive
detection of head and neck tumors, as precancerous or cancerous lesions show
specific spectral signatures that distinguish them from healthy tissue.
However, HSI data processing is challenging due to high spectral variations,
various image interferences, and the high dimensionality of the data.
Therefore, performance of automatic HSI analysis has been limited and so far,
mostly ex-vivo studies have been presented with deep learning. In this work, we
analyze deep learning techniques for in-vivo hyperspectral laryngeal cancer
detection. For this purpose we design and evaluate convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) with 2D spatial or 3D spatio-spectral convolutions combined
with a state-of-the-art Densenet architecture. For evaluation, we use an
in-vivo data set with HSI of the oral cavity or oropharynx. Overall, we present
multiple deep learning techniques for in-vivo laryngeal cancer detection based
on HSI and we show that jointly learning from the spatial and spectral domain
improves classification accuracy notably. Our 3D spatio-spectral Densenet
achieves an average accuracy of 81%.

adoption in safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars, drones, and
healthcare. Notably, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in which small
input perturbations can produce catastrophic misclassifications. In this work,
we propose EMPIR, ensembles of quantized DNN models with different numerical
precisions, as a new approach to increase robustness against adversarial
attacks. EMPIR is based on the observation that quantized neural networks often
demonstrate much higher robustness to adversarial attacks than full precision
networks, but at the cost of a substantial loss in accuracy on the original
(unperturbed) inputs. EMPIR overcomes this limitation to achieve the 'best of
both worlds', i.e., the higher unperturbed accuracies of the full precision
models combined with the higher robustness of the low precision models, by
composing them in an ensemble. Further, as low precision DNN models have
significantly lower computational and storage requirements than full precision
models, EMPIR models only incur modest compute and memory overheads compared to
a single full-precision model (<25% in our evaluations). We evaluate EMPIR
across a suite of DNNs for 3 different image recognition tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10
and ImageNet) and under 4 different adversarial attacks. Our results indicate
that EMPIR boosts the average adversarial accuracies by 42.6%, 15.2% and 10.5%
for the DNN models trained on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets
respectively, when compared to single full-precision models, without
sacrificing accuracy on the unperturbed inputs.

distributions are identical, it is possible to design a stopping time that
achieves a $\beta \approx 0.745$ fraction of the maximum value (the ``prophet''
benchmark), matching an upper bound of Hill and Kertz. In 2019, Correa et al.
showed that when the distributions differ, it is no longer possible to achieve
this bound: they prove an upper bound of $\sqrt{3} - 1 < 0.74$ on the best

  We show that it is possible to asymptotically achieve the $\beta \approx

allowed to remove a small constant number of distributions. Formally, we show
that for any $\varepsilon$, there exists a constant $C_{\varepsilon} =

  iPTF16geu","  We report the results from spectroscopic observations of the multiple images
of the strongly lensed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), iPTF16geu, obtained with
ground based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). From a single
epoch of slitless spectroscopy with HST, we can resolve spectra of individual
lensed supernova images for the first time. This allows us to perform an
independent measurement of the time-delay between the two brightest images,
$\Delta t = 1.4 \pm 5.0$ days, which is consistent with the time-delay measured
from the light-curves.
  We also present measurements of narrow emission and absorption lines
characterizing the interstellar medium in the host galaxy at z=0.4087, as well
as in the foreground lensing galaxy at z=0.2163. We detect strong Na ID
absorption in the host galaxy, indicating that iPTF16geu belongs to a subclass
of SNe Ia displaying ""anomalously"" large Na ID column densities in comparison
to the amount of dust extinction derived from their light curves. For the
deflecting galaxy, we refine the measurement of the velocity dispersion,
$\sigma = 129 \pm 4$ km/s, which significantly constrains the lens model.
  Since the time-delay between the SN images is negligible, we can use
unresolved ground based spectroscopy, boosted by a factor ~70 from lensing
magnification, to study the properties of a high-z SN Ia with unprecedented
signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral properties of the supernova, such as
pseudo-Equivalent widths of several absorption features and velocities of the
Si II-line indicate that iPTF16geu, besides being lensed, is a normal SN Ia,
indistinguishable from well-studied ones in the local universe, providing
support for the use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We do not detect any
significant deviations of the SN spectral energy distribution from microlensing
of the SN photosphere by stars and compact objects in the lensing galaxy.

[6,6]-phenyl-C$_{61}$-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Microscopic
understanding of the energy conversion mechanism in this system involves the
relationship between the electronic structure and the atomistic geometry of
P3HT:PCBM interfaces. In this work, the effect of the number of P3HT layers on
the electronic structure of the P3HT:PCBM interface is studied by means of
first-principles $GW$. We apply the substrate screening approach to accelerate
such calculations and to better understand the many-body dielectric screening
at the interface. The quasiparticle band gap of the entire interface is found
to decrease as the number of P3HT layers increases. The gaps of the individual
components of the interface are found to be smaller than their isolated

when comparing the system of P3HT:PCBM - where a single interface is present -
and the system of P3HT:PCBM:P3HT, where an interface is formed on either side
of PCBM, we find that the two systems exhibit very different quasiparticle

distribution protocol, that we call MUB-\textit{Quantum Computational Timelock}
(MUB-QCT) where one bit is encoded on a qudit state chosen among $d+1$ mutually
unbiased bases (MUBs). Short-term-secure encryption is used to share the basis
information with legitimate users while keeping it unknown from Eve until after
her quantum memory decoheres. This allows reducing Eve's optimal attack to an
immediate measurement followed by post-measurement decoding. \par We
demonstrate that MUB-QCT enables everlasting secure key distribution with input
states containing up to $O(\sqrt{d})$ photons. This leads to a series of
important improvements when compared to QKD: on the functional side, the
ability to operate securely between one sender and many receivers, whose
implementation can moreover be untrusted; significant performance increase,
characterized by a $O(\sqrt{d})$ multiplication of key rates and an extension
by $25 {\rm} km \times \log(d)$ of the attainable distance over fiber.
Implementable with a large number of modes with current or near-term multimode
photonics technologies, the MUB-QCT construction has the potential to provide a
radical shift to the performance and practicality of quantum key distribution.

is more than the prescribed range, set by government the ignition will be made
off provided either his heart beat abnormal or the driver is drowsy. In both
the cases there will be a message sent to the App and from the App you can send
it to family, friend, and well-wisher or nearest cop for the help. The system
is developed considering the fact if driver is drunk and he needs a help, his
friend can drive the car if he is not drunk. The safety of both the driver and
the surroundings are aimed by this system and this aids in minimizing death
cases by drunken driving and also burden on the cops.

benefit from greater mRNA secondary structure folding stability and optimal
codon usage. However, sequence design remains a hard problem due to the
exponentially many synonymous mRNA sequences that encode the same protein. We
show that this design problem can be reduced to a classical problem in formal
language theory and computational linguistics that can be solved in O(n3) time,
where n is the mRNA sequence length. This algorithm could still be too slow for
large n (e.g., n = 3, 822 nucleotides for the spike protein of SARS-CoV- 2), so
we further developed a linear-time approximate version, LinearDesign, inspired
by our recent work, LinearFold. This algorithm, LinearDesign, can compute the
approximate minimum free energy mRNA sequence for this spike protein in just 16
minutes using beam size b = 1, 000, with only 0.6% loss in free energy change
compared to exact search (i.e., b = infinity, which costs 1.6 hours). We also
develop two algorithms for incorporating the codon optimality into the design,
one based on k-best parsing to find alternative sequences and one directly
incorporating codon optimality into the dynamic programming. Our work provides
efficient computational tools to speed up and improve mRNA vaccine development.

and transmittance spectroscopy. The optical band gap is found to be very
sensitive to temperature, and to the monoclinic-to-tetragonal ferroelastic
transition at 523K. The anisotropy, as measured by the difference in absorption
edge for light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the principal axis, is
reduced from 0.2 eV in the high-temperature tetragonal phase to 0.1 eV at
ambient temperature. We show that this evolution is dominantly controlled by
the ferroelastic shear strain. These findings provide a route for further
optimization of bismuth-vanadate-based light absorbers in photocatalytic
devices.

  levels of renewables and sector integration","  Achieving climate targets requires to replace fossil fuels with renewables as
a primary source of energy. This implies to extend the use of electricity
generated from wind and solar beyond the power sector, either directly or
indirectly via synthetic fuels. Modelling the transformation towards such an
energy system is challenging, because it demands to account for fluctuations of
wind and solar and the manifold ways the system could adjust to these
fluctuations. This paper introduces the anyMOD framework and its graph-based
approach to address these challenges. By organizing sets in rooted trees, two
features to facilitate modelling high shares of renewables and sector
integration are enabled. First, the level of temporal and spatial detail can be
varied by energy carrier. As a result, model size can be reduced without
reducing the level of detail applied to fluctuating renewables. In addition, a
system's inherent flexibility, for example in the gas network, can be accounted
for. Second, substitution of energy carriers can be modelled to depend on the
respective context - conversion, storage, transport or demand. This achieves an
extensive representation of how integration of sectors is able to provide
flexibility.

environments. Despite this potential, most of the robot learning systems today
are deployed as a fixed policy and they are not being adapted after their
deployment. Can we efficiently adapt previously learned behaviors to new
environments, objects and percepts in the real world? In this paper, we present
a method and empirical evidence towards a robot learning framework that
facilitates continuous adaption. In particular, we demonstrate how to adapt
vision-based robotic manipulation policies to new variations by fine-tuning via
off-policy reinforcement learning, including changes in background, object
shape and appearance, lighting conditions, and robot morphology. Further, this
adaptation uses less than 0.2% of the data necessary to learn the task from
scratch. We find that our approach of adapting pre-trained policies leads to
substantial performance gains over the course of fine-tuning, and that
pre-training via RL is essential: training from scratch or adapting from
supervised ImageNet features are both unsuccessful with such small amounts of
data. We also find that these positive results hold in a limited continual
learning setting, in which we repeatedly fine-tune a single lineage of policies
using data from a succession of new tasks. Our empirical conclusions are
consistently supported by experiments on simulated manipulation tasks, and by
52 unique fine-tuning experiments on a real robotic grasping system pre-trained
on 580,000 grasps.

$\sim$6-55 times higher space density of such distant dusty systems within the

these $z$$>$5 galaxies show star-formation rate surface densities consistent
with so-called ""maximum"" starbursts, but we find significant differences in CO

the massive gas reservoirs are located in the dense, star-forming nuclear
regions - consistent with the more extended sizes of the [CII] emission
compared to the dust continuum and higher [CII]-to-far-infrared luminosity
ratios in those galaxies with lower gas excitation. We thus find substantial
variations in the conditions for star formation between $z$$>$5 dusty
starbursts, which typically have dust temperatures $\sim$57%$\pm$25% warmer
than starbursts at $z$=2-3 due to their enhanced star formation activity.

the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary matches that of the outer

significant effort to: understand what drives the intrinsic scatter of SN Ia
distance modulus residuals after standardization, characterize the distribution
of SN Ia colors, and explain why properties of the host galaxies of the SNe
correlate with SN Ia distance modulus residuals. We use a compiled sample of
$\sim1450$ spectroscopically confirmed, photometric light-curves of SN Ia and
propose a solution to these three problems simultaneously that also explains an
empirical 11$\sigma$ detection of the dependence of Hubble residual scatter on
SN Ia color. We introduce a physical model of color where intrinsic SN Ia
colors with a relatively weak correlation with luminosity are combined with
extrinsic dust-like colors ($E(B-V)$) with a wide range of extinction parameter
values ($R_V$). This model captures the observed trends of Hubble residual
scatter and indicates that the dominant component of SN Ia intrinsic scatter is
from variation in $R_V$. We also find that the recovered $E(B-V)$ and $R_V$
distributions differ based on global host-galaxy stellar mass and this explains
the observed correlation ($\gamma$) between mass and Hubble residuals seen in
past analyses as well as an observed 4.5$\sigma$ dependence of $\gamma$ on SN
Ia color. This finding removes any need to prescribe different intrinsic
luminosities to different progenitor systems. Finally we measure biases in the
equation-of-state of dark energy ($w$) up to $|\Delta w|=0.04$ by replacing
previous models of SN color with our dust-based model; this bias is larger than
any systematic uncertainty in previous SN Ia cosmological analyses.

  Signal from Reionization","  We examine the impact of the baryon-dark matter relative velocity on
intergalactic small-scale structure and the 21 cm signal during the epoch of
reionization (EoR). Streaming velocities reduced the clumping of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) on mass scales of $\sim 10^4 - 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$.
This effect produced a distinct baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in
the EoR 21 cm power spectrum at wave numbers $k\sim 0.1$ h/Mpc, near which
forthcoming surveys will be most sensitive. In contrast to the highly uncertain
impact of streaming velocities on star formation, the effect on clumping can be
calculated more precisely because it is set mainly by cosmology and
straightforward gas dynamics. We quantify the latter using fully coupled
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that capture the Jeans scale of the pre-EoR
gas. The clumping factor of ionized gas is reduced by 5-10\% in regions that
had typical streaming velocities of 30 km/s at recombination. The suppression
peaks $\approx 5$ Myr after a region is reionized, but washes out within 200
Myr due to pressure smoothing of the gas. Using these results, we model the
corresponding impact on the EoR 21 cm power spectrum and find that the BAO
feature is most likely to appear early in reionization ($\approx$ 10 \%
ionization).During this phase, the signal may appear at the 1 \% (5 \%) level
at $k \sim 0.1 (0.06)$ h/\Mpc with an amplitude that varies by less than a
factor of 10 across a range of reionization histories. We also provide a simple
model for the signal originating from streaming velocity's impact on ionizing
sources, which can vary by 4 orders of magnitude depending on highly uncertain
source properties. We find that the clumping-driven signal is likely to
dominate the source-driven one unless population III star formation in halos of
masses $10^6 - 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ was efficient enough to drive the first 10\%
of reionization.

after the gravitational wave signal GW170817 from a binary neutron star (BNS)
merger. It is now understood as an off-axis event powered by the cocoon of a
relativistic jet pointing 15 to 30 degrees away from the direction of
observation. The cocoon was energized by the interaction of the incipient jet
with the non-relativistic baryon wind from the merger remnant, resulting in a
structured outflow with a narrow core and broad wings. In this paper, we couple
the observational constraints on the structured outflow with a model for the
jet-wind interaction to constrain the intrinsic properties with which the jet
was launched by the central engine, including its time delay from the merger
event. Using wind prescriptions inspired by magnetized BNS merger simulations,
we find that the jet was launched within about 0.4 s from the merger, implying
that the 1.74 s observed delay was dominated by the fireball propagation up to
the photospheric radius. We also constrain, for the first time for any
gamma-ray burst, the jet opening angle at injection and set a lower limit to
its asymptotic Lorentz factor. These findings suggest an initially
Poynting-flux dominated jet, launched via electromagnetic processes. If the jet
was powered by an accreting black hole, they also provide a significant
constraint on the survival time of the metastable neutron star remnant.

typical values of ISM pressure in Milky Way, which is consistent with

show that the size distribution steepens with lower pressure, to slopes

  Dirac materials","  Unconventional superconductivity has been discovered in a variety of doped
materials, including topological insulators, semimetals and twisted bilayers. A
unifying property of these systems is strong orbital hybridization, which
involves pairing of states with non-trivial Bloch wave functions. In contrast
to naive expectation, many of these superconductors are relatively resilient to
disorder. Here we study the effects of a generic disorder on superconductivity
in doped 3D Dirac systems, which serve as a paradigmatic example for the
dispersion near a band crossing point. We argue that due to strong orbital
hybridization, interorbital scattering processes are naturally present and must
be taken into account. We calculate the reduction of the critical temperature
for a variety of pairing states and scattering channels using Abrikosov-Gor'kov
theory. In that way, the role of disorder is captured by a single parameter
$\Gamma$, the pair scattering rate. This procedure is very general and can be
readily applied to different band structures and disorder configurations. Our
results show that interorbital scattering has a significant effect on
superconductivity, where the robustness of different pairing states highly
depends on the relative strength of the different interorbital scattering
channels. Our analysis also reveals a protection, analogous to the Anderson's
theorem, of the odd-parity pairing state with total angular momentum zero (the
B-phase of superfluid $^3$He). This odd-pairty state is a singlet of partners
under $\mathcal{CT}$ symmetry (rather than $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in the
standard Anderson's theory), where $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are chiral
and time-reversal symmetries, respectively. As a result, it is protected
against any disorder potential that respects $\mathcal{CT}$ symmetry, which
includes a family of time-reversal odd (magnetic) impurities.

  Courses","  General-education college astronomy courses offer instructors both a unique
audience and a unique challenge. For many students, such a course may be their
first time encountering a standalone astronomy class, and it is also likely one
of the last science courses they will take. Thus, in a single semester, primary
course goals often include both imparting knowledge about the Universe and
giving students some familiarity with the processes of science. In traditional
course environments, students often compartmentalize information into separate
""life files"" and ""course files"" rather than integrating information into a
coherent framework. The astronomy course created through this project, taught
at the University of Arizona in Spring 2019, was designed around
inclusivity-driven guiding principles that help students engage with course
content in ways that are meaningful, relevant, and accessible. Our course
bridges the gap between students' ""life"" and ""course files"", encourages and
respects diverse points of view, and empowers students to connect course
content with their personal lives and identities. In this paper, we provide
insight into the guiding principles that informed our course design and share
research results on the effectiveness of the instructional strategies and
assessment techniques implemented in the course.

constraints on local terms (such as positivity) may entail an arbitrarily high
cost in their representation. Here we show that many of these separations
disappear in the approximate case. Specifically, for every approximation error
$\varepsilon$ and norm, we define the approximate rank as the minimum rank of
an element in the $\varepsilon$-ball with respect to that norm. For positive
semidefinite matrices, we show that the separations between rank, purification
rank, and separable rank disappear for a large class of Schatten $p$-norms. For
nonnegative tensors, we show that the separations between rank, positive
semidefinite rank, and nonnegative rank disappear for all $\ell_p$-norms with
$p>1$. For the trace norm ($p = 1$), we obtain upper bounds that depend on the
ambient dimension. We also provide a deterministic algorithm to obtain the
approximate decomposition attaining our bounds. Our main tool is an approximate
version of Carath\'eodory's Theorem. Our results imply that many separations
are not robust under small perturbations of the tensor, with implications in
quantum many-body systems and communication complexity.

  Contrast","  Partial voluming (PV) is arguably the last crucial unsolved problem in
Bayesian segmentation of brain MRI with probabilistic atlases. PV occurs when
voxels contain multiple tissue classes, giving rise to image intensities that
may not be representative of any one of the underlying classes. PV is
particularly problematic for segmentation when there is a large resolution gap
between the atlas and the test scan, e.g., when segmenting clinical scans with
thick slices, or when using a high-resolution atlas. In this work, we present
PV-SynthSeg, a convolutional neural network (CNN) that tackles this problem by
directly learning a mapping between (possibly multi-modal) low resolution (LR)
scans and underlying high resolution (HR) segmentations. PV-SynthSeg simulates
LR images from HR label maps with a generative model of PV, and can be trained
to segment scans of any desired target contrast and resolution, even for
previously unseen modalities where neither images nor segmentations are
available at training. PV-SynthSeg does not require any preprocessing, and runs
in seconds. We demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the method with
extensive experiments on three datasets and 2,680 scans. The code is available

  Inconsistent With the Weyl Curvature Hypothesis","  Our Universe has an arrow of time. In accordance with the second law of
thermodynamics, entropy has been increasing ever since the Big Bang. The fact
that matter is in thermal equilibrium in the very early Universe, as indicated
by the cosmic microwave background, has led to the idea that gravitational
entropy must be very low in the beginning. Penrose proposed that gravitational
entropy can be quantified by the Weyl curvature, which increases as structures
formed. A concrete realization of such a measure is the Clifton-Ellis-Tavakol
gravitational entropy, which has been shown to be increasing in quite a number
of cosmological models. In this work, we show a counter-example involving a
class of inhomogeneous universes that are supported by a chameleon massless
scalar field and exhibit anisotropic spacetime shearing effects. The topology
and the values of the three free parameters of the model are constrained by
imposing a positive energy density for the cosmic fluid, and the
thermodynamical requirements which follow from the cosmological holographic
principle and the second law. It is shown that a negative deceleration
parameter and a time decreasing Weyl curvature automatically follow from those
conditions. As a result, the Clifton-Ellis-Tavakol entropy decreases despite
the shear continues to grow in time.

that GANs can be used as a fast, efficient and computationally cheap emulator
for producing novel weak lensing convergence maps as well as cosmic web data in
2-D and 3-D. However, like any algorithm, the GAN approach comes with a set of
limitations, such as an unstable training procedure and the inherent randomness
of the produced outputs. In this work we employ a number of techniques commonly
used in the machine learning literature to address the mentioned limitations.
In particular, we train a GAN to produce both weak lensing convergence maps and
dark matter overdensity field data for multiple redshifts, cosmological
parameters and modified gravity models. In addition, we train a GAN using the
newest Illustris data to emulate dark matter, gas and internal energy
distribution data simultaneously. Finally, we apply the technique of latent
space interpolation to control which outputs the algorithm produces. Our
results indicate a 1-20% difference between the power spectra of the
GAN-produced and the training data samples depending on the dataset used and
whether Gaussian smoothing was applied. Finally, recent research on generative
models suggests that such algorithms can be treated as mappings from a
lower-dimensional input (latent) space to a higher dimensional (data) manifold.
We explore such a theoretical description as a tool for better understanding
the latent space interpolation procedure.

a higher percentage of anger as well as negative emotions. They also point to

leans strongly towards the latter.

waveform scaling strategy is proposed to scale up the number of
non-orthogonally packed sub-carriers, which complicates signal detections and
prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a waveform tuning strategy is proposed to
intentionally tune waveform parameters to enhance feature similarity.
Therefore, eavesdroppers would be confused to misidentify signals resulting in

Star Formation in Radio Survey. With $3-33$ GHz radio spectra, we measured the
spectral indices and corresponding thermal (free-free) emission fractions for a
sample of 335 discrete regions having significant detections in at least two
radio bands. After removing 14 likely background galaxies, we find that the
median thermal fraction at 33 GHz is $92 \pm 0.8\%$ with a median absolute
deviation of $11\%$, when a two-component power-law model is adopted to fit the
radio spectrum. Limiting the sample to 238 sources that are confidently
identified as star-forming regions, and not affected by potential AGN
contamination (i.e., having galactocentric radii $r_{\rm G} \geq 250$ pc),
results in a median thermal fraction of $93 \pm 0.8 \%$ with a median absolute
deviation of $10\%$. We further measure the thermal fraction at 33 GHz for 163
regions identified at 7"" resolution to be $94 \pm 0.8 \%$ with a median
absolute deviation of $8\%$. Together, these results confirm that free-free
emission dominates the radio spectra of star-forming regions on scales up to
$\sim$500 pc in normal star-forming galaxies. We additionally find a factor of
$\sim$1.6 increase in the scatter of the measured spectral index and thermal
fraction distributions as a function of decreasing galactocentric radius. This
trend is likely reflective of the continuous star-formation activity occurring
in the galaxy centers, resulting a larger contribution of diffuse nonthermal
emission relative to star-forming regions in the disk.

We analyzed the relative populations of atoms in excited fine-structure and

depleted interstellar medium or that of Jupiter-family comets. Compared to
results for disks around some other stars, such as $\beta$ Pic and 49 Cet, we
find surprisingly little neutral carbon. No molecular features were detected,
which indicates that our line of sight misses the molecule-rich central plane
of the disk. The tilt of the disk is also validated by our being able to detect
resonant scattering of the starlight by oxygen atoms.

are perfectly evenly-spaced -- have revolutionized optical science. By beating
an unknown signal with the many lines of a comb, its spectrum is recovered.
However, these techniques have been restricted to measuring coherent sources,
such as lasers. In this work, we demonstrate a new multiheterodyne technique
that allows for nearly any complex broadband spectrum to be retrieved using a
comb. Two versions are introduced: a delayed comb technique that uses a tunable
delay element, and a dual comb technique that uses a second comb. In each case,
the spectrum of the source is recovered by Fourier transforming the correlation
between two spectrograms. This approach is statistical in nature and is general
to nearly any source (coherent or incoherent), allowing for the entire spectrum
to be rapidly measured with high resolution.

problem of minimizing a quadratic function with additive noise in the gradient.
Three concepts of noise were considered: antagonistic noise in the vector,
stochastic noise in the vector and noise in the matrix, as well as combinations
of the first and second with noise in the matrix. It was experimentally
obtained that error accumulation is absent for any of the considered concepts,
which differs from the assumption of many experts who believe that, as in
accelerated methods, there is error accumulation. The paper gives a motivation
for why the error may not accumulate. The dependence of the solution error both
on the noise value and on the size of the solution was also experimentally
investigated using the conjugate gradient method. The hypotheses about the
solution error for all the concepts considered were tested: linearity in the
magnitude of the noise and the size of the solution - for the noise in the
vector, as well as linearity in the magnitude of the noise and the squareness
of the dependence on the size of the solution - for the noise in the matrix.
The work contains graphs illustrating each individual study, as well as a
detailed description of numerical experiments, which includes an account of the
methods of noise both vector and matrix.

mapping. Accounting for host galaxy and accretion disk contributions, we
obtained pure dust light curves in JHK. Cross correlations between the V-band
and the dust light curves yield an average rest-frame delay for the hot dust of
tau_cent ~ 410 days. This is a factor 2 shorter than expected from the the dust
ring radius R_x ~ 900 light days reported from interferometric studies. The
dust covering factor (CF) is about 8%, much smaller than predicted from the
half covering angle of 45 degree found for active galactic nuclei (AGN). We
analyse the asymmetric shape of the correlation functions and explore whether
an inclined bi-conical bowl-shaped dust torus geometry could bring these
findings (tau_cent, R_x and CF) into a consistent picture. The hot varying dust
emission originates from the edge of the bowl rim with a small covering angle
40 < theta < 45 degree, and we see only the near side of the bi-conus. Such a
dust gloriole with R_x = 900 +/- 200 ld and an inclination i = 12 degree
matches the data remarkably well. Comparing the results of 3C273 with

can handle either streaming features or data instances offline to produce a
fixed set of features for classification, while online classification methods
classify incoming instances using full knowledge about the feature space.
Nevertheless, all existing methods utilize a set of features, common for all
data instances, for classification. Instead, we propose a framework to perform
joint feature selection and classification on-the-fly, so as to minimize the
number of features evaluated for every data instance and maximize
classification accuracy. We derive the optimum solution of the associated

ETANA and F-ETANA, which are based on the optimum solution and its properties.
We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms on several public

state-of-the-art, and (ii) its applicability to broad range of application
domains including clinical research and natural language processing.

Depending on how the ensemble is used, an attacker may need to find a single

  CNNs","  Image description generation plays an important role in many real-world
applications, such as image retrieval, automatic navigation, and disabled
people support. A well-developed task of image description generation is image
captioning, which usually generates a short captioning sentence and thus
neglects many of fine-grained properties, e.g., the information of subtle
objects and their relationships. In this paper, we study the visual paragraph
generation, which can describe the image with a long paragraph containing rich
details. Previous research often generates the paragraph via a hierarchical
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-like model, which has complex memorising,
forgetting and coupling mechanism. Instead, we propose a novel pure CNN model,
ParaCNN, to generate visual paragraph using hierarchical CNN architecture with
contextual information between sentences within one paragraph. The ParaCNN can
generate an arbitrary length of a paragraph, which is more applicable in many
real-world applications. Furthermore, to enable the ParaCNN to model paragraph
comprehensively, we also propose an adversarial twin net training scheme.
During training, we force the forwarding network's hidden features to be close
to that of the backwards network by using adversarial training. During testing,
we only use the forwarding network, which already includes the knowledge of the
backwards network, to generate a paragraph. We conduct extensive experiments on
the Stanford Visual Paragraph dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

bridge the gap between decision procedures such as SMT, semi-automatic
inductive provers of the Boyer-Moore family like ACL2, and interactive proof
assistants for typed higher-order logics. Imandra's logic is computational,
based on a pure subset of OCaml in which all functions are terminating, with
restrictions on types and higher-order functions that allow conjectures to be
translated into multi-sorted first-order logic with theories, including
arithmetic and datatypes. Imandra has novel features supporting large-scale
industrial applications, including a seamless integration of bounded and
unbounded verification, first-class computable counterexamples, efficiently
executable models and a cloud-native architecture supporting live multiuser
collaboration.
  The core reasoning mechanisms of Imandra are (i) a semi-complete procedure
for finding models of formulas in the logic mentioned above, centered around
the lazy expansion of recursive functions, and (ii) an inductive waterfall and
simplifier which ""lifts"" many Boyer-Moore ideas to our typed higher-order
setting.
  These mechanisms are tightly integrated and subject to many forms of user
control. Imandra's user interfaces include an interactive toplevel, Jupyter
notebooks and asynchronous document-based verification (in the spirit of
Isabelle's Prover IDE) with VS Code.

  Measure Data Augmentation","  We present a new Bayesian inference method for compartmental models that
takes into account the intrinsic stochasticity of the process. We show how to
formulate a SIR-type Markov jump process as the solution of a stochastic
differential equation with respect to a Poisson Random Measure (PRM), and how
to simulate the process trajectory deterministically from a parameter value and
a PRM realisation.
  This forms the basis of our Data Augmented MCMC, which consists in augmenting
parameter space with the unobserved PRM value. The resulting simple
Metropolis-Hastings sampler acts as an efficient simulation-based inference
method, that can easily be transferred from model to model. Compared with a
recent Data Augmentation method based on Gibbs sampling of individual infection
histories, PRM-augmented MCMC scales much better with epidemic size and is far
more flexible.
  PRM-augmented MCMC also yields a posteriori estimates of the PRM, that
represent process stochasticity, and which can be used to validate the model.
If the model is good, the posterior distribution should exhibit no pattern and
be close to the PRM prior distribution. We illustrate this by fitting a
non-seasonal model to some simulated seasonal case count data. Applied to the
Zika epidemic of 2013 in French Polynesia, our approach shows that a simple
SEIR model cannot correctly reproduce both the initial sharp increase in the
number of cases as well as the final proportion of seropositive.
  PRM-augmentation thus provides a coherent story for Stochastic Epidemic Model
inference, where explicitly inferring process stochasticity helps with model
validation.

goal of addressing the information needs of millions of people. In this paper,
we report the results of an investigation into the incidence of Wikipedia links
in search engine results pages (SERPs). Our results extend prior work by
considering three U.S. search engines, simulating both mobile and desktop
devices, and using a spatial analysis approach designed to study modern SERPs
that are no longer just ""ten blue links"". We find that Wikipedia links are
extremely common in important search contexts, appearing in 67-84% of all SERPs
for common and trending queries, but less often for medical queries.
Furthermore, we observe that Wikipedia links often appear in ""Knowledge Panel""
SERP elements and are in positions visible to users without scrolling, although
Wikipedia appears less in prominent positions on mobile devices. Our findings
reinforce the complementary notions that (1) Wikipedia content and research has
major impact outside of the Wikipedia domain and (2) powerful technologies like
search engines are highly reliant on free content created by volunteers.

using a low resolution spectrograph mounted on the 1.2m telescope at Mount Abu
Infrared Observatory, India. The comet was observed on two dates in January
2018, when it was at a heliocentric distance of 2.8 AU. Study based on our
observations revealed that the optical spectrum of this comet is quite unusual
as compared to general cometary spectra. Most of the major cometary emissions
like C$_{2}$, C$_{3}$ and CN were absent in comet C/2016 R2. However, the comet
spectrum showed very strong emission bands from ionic species like CO$^{+}$ and
N$_{2}^{+}$. A mean N$_{2}$/CO ratio of 0.09 $\pm$ 0.02 was derived from the
spectra and an extremely low depletion factor of 1.6 $\pm$ 0.4 has been
estimated for this ratio as compared to the solar nebula. We have also detected
minor emission features beyond 5400 Angstroms, albeit marginally. The column
densities of CO$^{+}$ and N$_{2}^{+}$ were calculated from their emission
bands. The optical spectrum suggests that the cometary ice is dominated by CO.
The low depletion factor of N$_{2}$/CO ratio in this comet, as compared to the
solar nebula and the unusual spectrum of the comet are consequences of
distinctive processing at the location of its formation in the early solar
nebula.

  Spline ANOVA Models in Large Samples","  Large samples have been generated routinely from various sources. Classic
statistical models, such as smoothing spline ANOVA models, are not well
equipped to analyze such large samples due to expensive computational costs. In
particular, the daunting computational costs of selecting smoothing parameters
render smoothing spline ANOVA models impractical. In this article, we develop
an asympirical, i.e., asymptotic and empirical, smoothing parameters selection
approach for smoothing spline ANOVA models in large samples. The idea of this
approach is to use asymptotic analysis to show that the optimal smoothing
parameter is a polynomial function of the sample size and an unknown constant.
The unknown constant is then estimated through empirical subsample
extrapolation. The proposed method significantly reduces the computational
costs of selecting smoothing parameters in high-dimensional and large samples.
We show smoothing parameters chosen by the proposed method tend to the optimal
smoothing parameters that minimise a specific risk function. In addition, the
estimator based on the proposed smoothing parameters achieves the optimal
convergence rate. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the numerical
advantage of the proposed method over competing methods in terms of relative
efficacies and running time. On an application to molecular dynamics data with
nearly one million observations, the proposed method has the best prediction
performance.

  SARS-CoV-2 and their potential therapeutic implications","  The primary cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Recently it has been noticed that the
viral Spike protein has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins
may be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the
Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource, ELM, and were presented with candidate short
linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with
potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton and
cell signalling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates.
They suggest potential interactions with the AP2 mu2 subunit as well as I-BAR,
LC3, PDZ, PTB and SH2 domains found in signalling and regulatory proteins
present in epithelial lung cells. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences,
suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, often involving tyrosine
phosphorylation status. Candidate LIR motifs are present in the tails of ACE2
and integrin beta3, suggesting that these proteins can directly recruit
autophagy components. We also noticed that the extracellular part of ACE2 has a
conserved MIDAS structural motif, which are commonly used by beta integrins for
ligand binding, potentially supporting the proposal that integrins and ACE2
share common ligands. The findings presented here identify several molecular
links and testable hypotheses that might help uncover the mechanisms of
SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry and replication, and strengthen the possibility
that it might be possible to develop host-directed therapies to dampen the
efficiency of viral entry and hamper disease progression. The strong sequence
conservation means that these putative SLiMs are good candidates: Nevertheless,
SLiMs must always be validated by experimentation before they can be stated to
be functional.

polarization in their conjugated electron system. However, magnetism in GNRs is
generally associated to localized states around zigzag edges, difficult to
fabricate and with high reactivity. Here we demonstrate that magnetism can also
be induced away from physical GNR zigzag edges through atomically precise
engineering topological defects in its interior. A pair of substitutional boron
atoms inserted in the carbon backbone breaks the conjugation of their
topological bands and builds two spin-polarized boundary states around. The
spin state was detected in electrical transport measurements through
boron-substituted GNRs suspended between tip and sample of a scanning tunneling
microscope. First-principle simulations find that boron pairs induce a spin 1,
which is modified by tuning the spacing between pairs. Our results demonstrate
a route to embed spin chains in GNRs, turning them basic elements of spintronic

acquired with any modality, without requiring real data during training. While
classical registration methods can accurately align multi-modal image pairs,
they solve a costly optimization problem for every new pair of images.
Learning-based techniques are fast at test time, but can only register images
of the specific anatomy and modalities they were trained on. In contrast, our
approach leverages a generative model to synthesize label maps and gray-scale
images that expose a network to a wide range of anatomy and contrast during
training. We demonstrate that this strategy enables robust registration of
arbitrary modalities, without the need to retrain for a new modality.
Critically, we show that input labels need not be of actual anatomy: training
on randomly synthesized shapes, or supervoxels, results in competitive
registration performance and makes the network agnostic to anatomy and
contrast, all while eradicating the need for real data. We present extensive
experiments demonstrating that this strategy enables registration of modalities
not seen during training and surpasses the state of art in cross-contrast
registration. Our code is integrated with the VoxelMorph library at:

observations on annotations. It approaches the topic from several angles

Artificial Intelligence and Open Science. Annotations can be examined along
different dimensions. In terms of complexity, they can range from trivial to
highly sophisticated, in terms of maturity from experimental to standardised.
Annotations can be annotated themselves using more abstract annotations.
Primary research data such as, e.g., text documents can be annotated on
different layers concurrently, which are independent but can be exploited using
multi-layer querying. Standards guarantee interoperability and reusability of
data sets. The chapter concludes with four final observations, formulated as

translated into non-linear Regge trajectories with the generic form

particular, for the linear case with quadratic functions and Gaussian noise,
stochastic control has shown remarkable results in different fields, including
robotics, reinforcement learning and neuroscience, especially thanks to the
established duality of estimation and control processes. Following this idea we
recently introduced a formulation of PID control, one of the most popular
methods from classical control, based on active inference, a theory with roots
in variational Bayesian methods, and applications in the biological and neural
sciences. In this work, we highlight the advantages of our previous formulation

current controller design procedures. In particular, we consider 1) a
gradient-based tuning rule for the parameters (or gains) of a PID controller,
2) an implementation of multiple degrees of freedom for independent responses
to different types of signals (e.g., two-degree-of-freedom PID), and 3) a novel
time-domain formalisation of the performance-robustness trade-off in terms of
tunable constraints (i.e., priors in a Bayesian model) of a single cost

associated multiple MV fields, our designed network can generate more accurate
prediction of the current frame, yielding less residual. Multiple reference
frames also help generate MV prediction, which reduces the coding cost of MV
field. We use two deep auto-encoders to compress the residual and the MV,
respectively. To compensate for the compression error of the auto-encoders, we
further design a MV refinement network and a residual refinement network,
taking use of the multiple reference frames as well. All the modules in our
scheme are jointly optimized through a single rate-distortion loss function. We
use a step-by-step training strategy to optimize the entire scheme.
Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing

increasingly common. This research seeks to characterize the performance of
aperture masking interferometry in the near-infrared at small scales. A mask
containing six pairs of apertures at varying diameters and separations was
constructed for use with a 24-inch telescope at the MIT Wallace Astrophysical
Observatory. Test images of Spica and Jupiter were captured for 28 different
telescope configurations, varying aperture separation, aperture diameter,
collection wavelength, and exposure time. Lucky imaging was used to account for
atmospheric perturbations. Each image was reduced via bias and dark frames to
account for sensor noise, and then the full width at half maximum for each
image was computed and used as a proxy for maximum angular resolution. The data
imply that at small scales aperture size primarily controls the observed
maximum angular resolution, but further data are required to substantiate the
claim.

  Background toward Clusters of Galaxies","  We show that Compton scattering by electrons of the hot intergalactic gas in
galaxy clusters should lead to peculiar distortions of the cosmic background
X-ray and soft gamma-ray radiation - an increase in its brightness at E<60-100
keV and a drop at higher energies. The distortions allow the most important
cluster parameters to be measured. The spectral shape of the distortions and
its dependence on the gas temperature, optical depth, and surface density
distribution law have been studied using Monte Carlo computations and confirmed
by analytical estimations. In the cluster frame the maximum of the background
decrease due to the recoil effect occurs at ~500-600 keV. The photoionization
of H- and He-like iron and nickel ions leads to additional distortions in the
background spectrum - a strong absorption line with the threshold at ~9 keV
(and also to an absorption jump at ~2 keV for cold clusters). The absorption of
intrinsic thermal radiation from the cluster gas by these ions also leads to
such lines. In nearby (z<1) clusters the line at ~2 keV is noticeably enhanced
by absorption in the colder (~10^6 K) plasma of their peripheral (~3 Mpc)
regions; moreover, the absorption line at ~1.3 keV splits off from it. The
redshift of distant clusters shifts the absorption lines in the background
spectrum (at ~2, ~9, and ~500 keV) to lower energies. Thus, in contrast to the
microwave background scattering effect, this effect depends on the cluster
redshift z, but in a very peculiar way. When observing clusters at z>1, the
effect allows one to determine how the X-ray background evolved and how it was
""gathered"" with z. To detect the effect, the accuracy of measurements should
reach ~0.1%. We consider the most promising clusters for observing the effect
and discuss the techniques whereby the influence of the thermal gas radiation
hindering the detection of background distortions should be minimal.

systems, though their efficacy depends heavily on the accuracy of the model
used. Deep neural networks have been used to learn models of robot dynamics
from data, but they suffer from data-inefficiency and the difficulty to
incorporate prior knowledge. We introduce Structured Mechanical Models, a
flexible model class for mechanical systems that are data-efficient, easily
amenable to prior knowledge, and easily usable with model-based control
techniques. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the benefits of using
Structured Mechanical Models in lieu of black-box neural networks when modeling
robot dynamics. We demonstrate that they generalize better from limited data
and yield more reliable model-based controllers on a variety of simulated
robotic domains.

images and signals. Suggested in 1994, this approach is carried out by
rectifying the coefficients of a noisy image in the transform domain, using a
set of scalar shrinkage function (SFs). A plethora of papers deals with the
optimal shape of the SFs and the transform used, where it is known that
applying the SFs in redundant bases provides improved results. This paper
provides a complete picture of the interrelations between the transform used,
the optimal shrinkage functions, and the domains in which they are optimized.
In particular, we show that for subband optimization, where each SF is
optimized independently for a particular band, optimizing the SFs in the
spatial domain is always better than or equal to optimizing the SFs in the
transform domain. For redundant bases, we provide the expected denoising gain
we may achieve, relative to the unitary basis, as a function of the redundancy
rate.

SRC may be responsible for breaking pairing gaps in nuclear matter. In this
work we revisit the concept of SRC for beta equilibrated matter in neutron
stars. We construct two equivalent models, with and without SRC and proceed to
investigate the thermal evolution of stars described by such models. We show
that SRC play a major role in the thermal evolution of neutron stars. It will
be shown that while the SRC largely leaves the macroscopic properties of the
star unaltered, it significantly alters the proton fraction, thus leading to an
early onset of the direct Urca (DU) process, which in turns leads to stars
exhibiting much faster cooling.

plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA), are commonly treated as separate, though
related branches of high-gradient plasma-based acceleration. However, novel
proposed schemes are increasingly residing at the interface of both concepts
where the understanding of their interplay becomes crucial. Here, we report on
experiments covering a wide range of parameters by using nanocoulomb-class
quasi-monoenergetic electron beams from LWFA with a 100-TW-class laser. Based
on a controlled electron injection, these beams reach record-level performance
in terms of laser-to-beam energy transfer efficiency (up to 10%), spectral
charge density (regularly exceeding 10 pC/MeV) and divergence (1 mrad full
width at half maximum divergence). The impact of charge fluctuations on the
energy spectra of electron bunches is assessed for different laser parameters,
including a few-cycle laser, followed by a presentation of results on beam
loading in LWFA with two electron bunches. This scenario is particularly
promising to provide high-quality electron beams by using one of the bunches to
either tailor the laser wakefield via beam loading or to drive its own,
beam-dominated wakefield. We present experimental evidence for the latter,
showing a varying acceleration of a low-energy witness beam with respect to the
charge of a high-energy drive beam in a spatially separate gas target. With the
increasing availability of petawatt-class lasers the access to this new regime
of laser-plasma wakefield acceleration will be further facilitated, thus
providing new paths towards low-emittance beam generation for future
plasma-based colliders or light sources.

classifier for each possible variant of training data in order to select the
best-performing subset of pre-processing techniques for a given dataset. In
this paper, we propose to train an independent classifier for each available

efficiently determine the best combination of normalization and augmentation
techniques for a specific dataset. For the best-performing combination, we can
retrospectively apply the normalized/augmented variants of input data to train
only a single classifier. This also allows us to decide whether it is better to
train a single model, or rather a set of independent classifiers.

understanding of default risk. Managers seek to steer away from trouble, credit
providers to avoid risky loans and investors to mitigate losses. Applying
Topological Data Analysis tools this paper explores whether failing firms from
the United States organise neatly along the five predictors of default proposed
by the Z-score models. Firms are represented as a point cloud in a five
dimensional space, one axis for each predictor. Visualising that cloud using
Ball Mapper reveals failing firms are not often neighbours. As new modelling
approaches vie to better predict firm failure, often using black boxes to
deliver potentially over-fitting models, a timely reminder is sounded on the
importance of evidencing the identification process. Value is added to the
understanding of where in the parameter space failure occurs, and how firms
might act to move away from financial distress. Further, lenders may find
opportunity amongst subsets of firms that are traditionally considered to be in
danger of bankruptcy but actually sit in characteristic spaces where failure
has not occurred.

obtain a trade-off between amortized update time and expected stretch against
an oblivious adversary. At the two extremes of this trade-off, we can maintain
a tree of expected stretch $ O (\log^4 n) $ with update time $ m^{1/2 + o(1)} $
or a tree of expected stretch $ n^{o(1)} $ with update time $ n^{o(1)} $ (for
edge weights polynomial in $ n $). A guarantee of the latter type has so far
only been known for maintaining tree embeddings with average (instead of
expected) stretch [Chechik/Zhang, SODA '20].
  Our main result has direct implications to fully dynamic approximate distance
oracles and fully dynamic buy-at-bulk network design. For dynamic distance
oracles, our result is the first to break the $ O (\sqrt{m}) $ update-time
barrier. For buy-at-bulk network design, a problem which also in the static
setting heavily relies on probabilistic tree embeddings, we give the first
non-trivial dynamic algorithm. As probabilistic tree embeddings are an
important tool in static approximation algorithms, further applications of our
result in dynamic approximation algorithms are conceivable.
  From a technical perspective, we obtain our main result by first designing a
decremental algorithm for probabilistic low-diameter decompositions via a
careful combination of Bartal's ball-growing approach [FOCS '96] with the
pruning framework of Chechik and Zhang [SODA '20]. We then extend this to a
fully dynamic algorithm by enriching a well-known 'decremental to fully
dynamic' reduction with a new bootstrapping idea to recursively employ a fully
dynamic algorithm instead of a static one in this reduction.

down the economy while staying within the capacity of the healthcare system. We
base our analysis on a detailed heterogeneous epidemiological model, which
takes into account different population groups and phases of the disease,
including incubation, infection period, hospitalization, and treatment in the
intensive care unit (ICU). We model the healthcare capacity as the total number
of hospital and ICU beds for the whole country. We calibrate the model
parameters to data reported in several recent research papers. For high- and
low-risk population groups, we calculate the number of total and intensive care
hospitalizations, and deaths as functions of time. The main conclusion is that
countries, which enforce reasonable hygienic measures on time can avoid
lockdowns throughout the pandemic provided that the number of spare ICU beds
per million is above the threshold of about 100. In countries where the total
number of ICU beds is below this threshold, a limited period quarantine to
specific high-risk groups of the population suffices. Furthermore, in the case
of an inadequate capacity of the healthcare system, we incorporate a feedback
loop and demonstrate that quantitative impact of the lack of ICU units on the
death curve. In the case of inadequate ICU beds, full- and partial-quarantine
scenarios outcomes are almost identical, making it unnecessary to shut down the
whole economy. We conclude that only a limited-time quarantine of the high-risk
group might be necessary, while the rest of the economy can remain operational.

beneficiaries with the same episode (MJRLE or AMI) at a matched comparison
hospital. Main Outcomes and Measures: Medicare payments, LOS, and readmissions
during the episode, which includes the anchor hospitalization and the 90-day
post discharge period. Results: Mean total Medicare payments for an MJRLE
episode and the 90-day post discharge period declined $444 more (p < 0.0001)
for Medicare beneficiaries with episodes initiated in a BPCI-participating
provider than for the beneficiaries in a comparison provider. This reduction
was mainly due to reduced institutional post-acute care (PAC) payments. Slight
reductions in carrier payments and LOS were estimated. Readmission rates were
not statistically different between the BPCI and the comparison populations.
These findings suggest that PAC use can be reduced without adverse effects on
recovery from MJRLE. The lack of statistically significant differences in
effects for AMI could be explained by a smaller sample size or more
heterogenous recovery paths in AMI. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, as
currently designed, bundled payments can be effective in reducing payments for
MJRLE episodes of care, but not necessarily for AMI. Most savings came from the
declines in PAC. These findings are consistent with the results reported in the
BPCI model evaluation for CMS.

nonperturbatively for $K\ge 3$. In order to study low-energy behaviors, we
analyze these systems using 't Hooft anomaly matching and reliable semiclassics
on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$. Thanks to 't Hooft anomaly that involves $1$-form
center symmetry and discrete chiral symmetry, we predict that chiral symmetry
must be spontaneously broken in the confinement phase, and there exist $N$
vacua. Theories with even $K$ possess a physical $\theta$ angle despite the
presence of massless fermions, and we further predict the $N$-branch structure
associated with it; the number of vacua is enhanced to $2N$ at $\theta=\pi$ due
to spontaneous $CP$ breaking. Both of these predictions are explicitly
confirmed by reliable semiclassics on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$ with the
double-trance deformation. Symmetry and anomaly of odd-$K$ theories are the
same as those of the ${\cal N}=1$ SYM, and the ones of even-$K$ theories are

can be continuously deformed without quantum phase transitions. We briefly
discuss anomaly inflow on the domain walls connecting the vacua of the theory

  Dynamics","  This paper introduces a framework for learning a minimum-norm stabilizing
controller for a system with unknown dynamics using model-free policy
optimization methods. The approach begins by first designing a Control Lyapunov
Function (CLF) for a (possibly inaccurate) dynamics model for the system, along
with a function which specifies a minimum acceptable rate of energy dissipation
for the CLF at different points in the state-space. Treating the energy
dissipation condition as a constraint on the desired closed-loop behavior of
the real-world system, we formulate an optimization problem over the parameters
of a learned controller for the system. The optimization problem can be solved
using model-free policy optimization algorithms and data collected from the
real-world system. One term in the optimization encourages choices of
parameters which minimize control effort, while another term penalizes
violations of the safety constraint. If there exists at least one choice of
learned parameters which satisfy the CLF constraint then all globally optimal
solutions for the optimization also satisfy the constraint if the penalty term
is scaled to be large enough. Furthermore, we derive conditions on the
structure of the learned controller which ensure that the optimization is
strongly convex, meaning the globally optimal solution can be found reliably.
We validate the approach in simulation, first for a double pendulum, and then
generalize to learn stable walking controllers for underactuated bipedal robots
using the Hybrid Zero Dynamics framework. By encoding a large amount of
structure into the learning problem, we are able to learn stabilizing
controllers for both systems with only minutes or even seconds of training
data.

However, such estimators impose a computational overhead that degrades the

Our solution is rigorously analyzed and empirically evaluated against several

parametric modeling assumptions. However, the use of machine learning may
result in bias and incorrect inferences due to overfitting. Cross-fit
estimators have been proposed to eliminate this bias and yield better
statistical properties.
  We conducted a simulation study to assess the performance of several
different estimators for the average causal effect (ACE). The data generating
mechanisms for the simulated treatment and outcome included log-transforms,
polynomial terms, and discontinuities. We compared singly-robust estimators
(g-formula, inverse probability weights) and doubly-robust estimators
(augmented inverse probability weights, targeted maximum likelihood
estimation). Nuisance functions were estimated with parametric models and
ensemble machine learning, separately. We further assessed cross-fit
doubly-robust estimators.
  With correctly specified parametric models, all of the estimators were
unbiased and confidence intervals achieved nominal coverage. When used with
machine learning, only the cross-fit estimators were unbiased and had nominal
confidence interval coverage.
  Due to the difficulty of properly specifying parametric models in high
dimensional data, doubly-robust estimators with ensemble learning and
cross-fitting may be the preferred approach for estimation of the ACE in most
epidemiologic studies. However, these approaches may require larger sample
sizes to avoid finite-sample issues.

lead to trivial or extremely poor classifiers. In particular, for the embedding

the server imposes a geometric regularizer after each round to encourage

role in determining the energy release rate during the combustion of the
aluminized energetic materials. In this paper, the physics of the vaporization
of aluminum droplets in shocked flows is numerically investigated. Surrogate
models for the temporally averaged Sherwood number and Nusselt number, cast as
functions of shock Mach number and Reynolds number, are developed from the
simulation-based data. The results show that the Sherwood number and the
Nusselt number of the droplet increase monotonically with the Reynolds number.
On the other hand, the Sherwood number and the Nusselt number exhibit
non-monotonic behavior with increasing shock Mach number due to the transition
of the post-shock flow from subsonic to the supersonic speeds as the shock Mach
number is increased from 1.1 to 3.5. In contrast with available models in the
literature that are commonly used in process scale computations of aluminum
droplet vaporization, the current models for the Sherwood number and the
Nusselt number are applicable over a wide range of the Reynolds number and the
Mach number and will be useful in the macro-scale multi-phase simulations of

where we defined Donaldson-Thomas invariants of quantum Fermat threefolds. In
this paper, we study the generic quantum Fermat threefold. We give explicit
local models for Hilbert schemes of points as quivers with potential, and
compute degree zero Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The result is expressed in
terms of certain colored plane partitions.

like to retrieve a passage of music from a MIDI file by taking a cell phone
picture of a physical page of sheet music. While audio-sheet music retrieval
has been explored by a number of works, this scenario is novel in that the
query is a cell phone picture rather than a digital scan. To solve this
problem, we introduce a mid-level feature representation called a bootleg score
which explicitly encodes the rules of Western musical notation. We convert both
the MIDI and the sheet music into bootleg scores using deterministic rules of
music and classical computer vision techniques for detecting simple geometric
shapes. Once the MIDI and cell phone image have been converted into bootleg
scores, we estimate the alignment using dynamic programming. The most notable
characteristic of our system is that it does test-time adaptation and has no
trainable weights at all -- only a set of about 30 hyperparameters. On a
dataset containing 1000 cell phone pictures taken of 100 scores of classical
piano music, our system achieves an F measure score of .869 and outperforms
baseline systems based on commercial optical music recognition software.

  Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model","  In the long-range Su-Schriffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in which the next
nearest-neighbor hopping is considered, there exhibits a rich topological phase
diagram that contains winding numbers $w=0, 1$, and $2$. In the presence of
disorder, the change in mean winding number with various disorder strengths is
numerically calculated. We find that the disorder drives phase transitions:
$w=0 \rightarrow 1, 0 \rightarrow 2 $, $1 \rightarrow 2$ and $2 \rightarrow 1$,
in which the non-zero winding numbers driven by disorder are called the
topological Anderson insulating (TAI) phases. The transition mechanisms in this
long-range SSH model are investigated by means of localization length and
self-energy. We find that the localization length has a drastic change at the
transition point, and the corresponding critical disorder strength is obtained
by further using Born approximation to the self-energy. The origin for the $w =
0$ to $w = 1, 2$ transitions is attributed to the energy gap renormalization
(first Born approximation), while for the transitions from $w=1$ to $w=2$ and
vice versa are the strong scattering (self-consistent Born approximation). The
result of self-consistent Born approximation suggests that in the thermodynamic
limit, the gap closing point is not at the Fermi level for the system with
localized edge states. This agrees with the topological protection of edge
states, such that the pre-existent edge states are protected from being
scattered into bulk. Given the experimental feasibility of the long-range SSH
model, the predicted TAI phases and transitions could be observed in
experiments.

appearing in images (e.g. signboards, traffic signals or brands in clothing or
objects). This is a challenging problem due to the complexity of the context
where texts appear (uneven backgrounds, shading, occlusions, perspective
distortions, etc.). Only a few approaches try to exploit the relation between
text and its surrounding environment to better recognize text in the scene. In
this paper, we propose a visual context dataset for Text Spotting in the wild,
where the publicly available dataset COCO-text [Veit et al. 2016] has been
extended with information about the scene (such as objects and places appearing
in the image) to enable researchers to include semantic relations between texts
and scene in their Text Spotting systems, and to offer a common framework for
such approaches. For each text in an image, we extract three kinds of context
information: objects in the scene, image location label and a textual image
description (caption). We use state-of-the-art out-of-the-box available tools
to extract this additional information. Since this information has textual
form, it can be used to leverage text similarity or semantic relation methods
into Text Spotting systems, either as a post-processing or in an end-to-end
training strategy. Our data is publicly available at https://git.io/JeZTb.

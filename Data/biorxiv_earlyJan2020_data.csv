Recent advances in proteomics have led to the identification of hundreds of ECM proteins which are more abundant in tumors relative to healthy tissue. Our goal was to develop a pipeline to easily predict which of these ECM proteins is more likely to have an effect on cancer invasion and metastasis. We evaluated the effect of 4 ECM proteins upregulated in breast tumor tissue in multiple human breast cancer cell lines in 3 assays. We found there was no linear relationship between the 11 cell shape parameters we quantified when cells adhere to ECM proteins and 2D cell migration speed, persistence or 3D invasion. We then used classifiers and partial-least squares regression analysis to identify which metrics best predicted ECM-driven 2D migration and 3D invasion responses. ECM-driven 2D cell migration speed or persistence did not correlate with or predict 3D invasion in response to that same cue. However, cell adhesion, and in particular cell elongation and irregularity accurately predicted the magnitude of ECM-driven 2D migration and 3D invasion in all cell lines. Testing predictions revealed that our models are good at predicting the effect of novel ECM proteins within a given cell line, but that ECM responses are cell-line specific. Overall, our studies identify the cell morphological features that determine 3D invasion responses to individual ECM proteins. This platform will help provide insight into the functional role of ECM proteins abundant tumor tissue and help prioritize strategies for targeting tumor-ECM interactions to treat metastasis.

Conflict-of-interest: None.

Insight BoxMetastasis, the dissemination of tumor cells, is driven by the interaction of invading tumor cells with their local environment, in particular with the ECM, which provides structure and support to our tissues. This study presents an integrated approach to predict the effect of individual ECM proteins on 3D invasion and metastasis based on simple adhesion assays which quantify cell shape. Machine learning classification and partial-least squares regression models reveal that ECM-driven 2D cell migration metrics are not predictive of 3D invasion, and that cell shape of cells adhered to ECM can predict that proteins effect on 3D invasion. These data provide a pipeline for predicting the effect of ECM proteins on breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis.","NA"

Work in recent years has shown that the majority of +TIPs are directed to the plus-end through a family of end binding proteins (EBs), which preferentially bind the stabilizing cap of GTP-tubulin present during microtubule growth, versus weaker binding to GDP-tubulin in the proximal microtubule. One question yet to be addressed is whether there may exist other microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) that preferentially bind specific nucleotide states of tubulin. Here we report that the neuronal MAP tau, which is enriched in axons where it promotes microtubule growth and bundling, preferentially binds GDP-tubulin (KD = 0.26 {micro}M) over GMPCPP-tubulin (KD = 1.1 {micro}M) in vitro as well as GTP-tubulin at the tips of growing microtubules in vitro and in vivo. This nucleotide preference causes tau binding to lag behind the growing microtubule plus-end by about 100-200 nm both in vitro and in live cells. Thus, tau is a microtubule tip avoiding protein, establishing a new class of tip avoiding MAPs, and acts primarily by suppressing microtubule shortening rather than promoting growth. We speculate that neurological disease-relevant tau mutations may exert their phenotype by their failure to properly recognize GDP-tubulin, thus displacing +TIPs, such as EB3, and their associated activities into abnormal locations in the neuron.","NA"

Despite its expression in the mammalian cortex, little is known about the contribution of TRPA1 to cortical function. Here we investigate the role of TRPA1 in sensory information processing by performing electrophysiological recording and 2-photon calcium imaging from two sensory areas in mice: the primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1) and the primary visual cortex (V1). In vS1, local activation of TRPA1 by its agonist AITC significantly increased the spontaneous activity of cortical neurons, their evoked response to vibrissal stimulation, and their response range, consistent with a positive gain modulation. TRPA1 inhibition with HC-030031 reversed these modulations to below initial control gains. The gain modulations were absent in TRPA1 Knockout mice. In V1, TRPA1 activation increased the gain of direction and orientation selectivity similarly to the gain modulations observed in vS1 cortex. Linear decoding analysis of V1 population activity confirmed faster and more reliable encoding of visual signals in the presence of TRPA1 activation. Overall, our findings reveal a physiological role for TRPA1 in enhancing sensory signals in the mammalian cortex.","NA"

C.","Rebecca C Christofferson","Louisiana State University","2020-01-01",5,"cc_no","new results","ecology","The transmission dynamics of arboviruses like Zika virus (ZIKV) are most often evaluated by vector competence and the related extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which represent the proportion of vectors that become infectious given exposure and the time it takes for a vector to become infectious given exposure, respectively. Thus, EIP is the temporality of vector competence, and these measures have been used to evaluate the relative fitness of arbovirus systems. However, another temporal process critical to assessing arbovirus transmission dynamics is the age-structure of vector populations, as studies have demonstrated how vector mortality interplays with vector competence and EIP to alter transmission system efficiency. These and other parameters are critical to vectorial capacity (VC), a measure of transmission potential of a vector-pathogen system. However, how these three components - EIP, vector competence, and age - affect VC still needs to be addressed. We first compared experimentally how vector competence/EIP and mosquito age at the time of infection acquisition (Ageacquisition) interacted in an Aedes aegypti-ZIKV model system. We found that Ageacquisition did not alter the vector competence/EIP using traditional analyses, except in the context of mortality. To capture and quantify this age-dependent context, we developed an age-structured vectorial capacity framework (VCage) by experimentally determining daily mortality and probability of biting, as well as vector competence/EIP parameterized as EIPMin and EIPMax. Like previous studies, we found that arbovirus phenotypes leading to outbreaks are not straightforward and may follow a tortoise and the hare (TotH), whereby slow and steady is as or better than fast and furious phenotypes. Understanding the contributions of these age-dependent life traits as well as VCage allows for quantification and visualization of both the magnitude and temporality of transmission dynamics in an age-dependent manner, which reveals this TotH model that should change how compare and rank arbovirus phenotypes, and perhaps even how we identify  highly or  negligibly competent vectors.","NA"

Hydrological and nutrient dynamics of Andean fluvial ecosystems, and how they are affected by anthropic impacts is still poorly known. We characterized two adjacent streams with contrasting drainage basins: Casa de Piedra, originating in a small mountain lake and running through a pristine landscape, and Gutierrez, originating in a large piedmont lake and running through an anthropized landscape. Despite both drainage basins sharing geology and temperature and precipitation regimes, we found that the streams presented contrasting hydrological dynamics and nutrient export values. Casa de Piedra had higher discharge flashiness with shorter response delays to precipitation, while Gutierrez showed more stable hydrograms due to buffering by the large piedmont lake in Gutierrezs basin. Streams showed differences in the quality and timing of coarse particulate organic matter export and basal export levels of phosphorus and nitrogen that could be explained by human activities affecting Gutierrez but not Casa de Piedra. Moreover, nitrogen:phosphorus ratio indicates a possible future shift to phosphorus as the limiting nutrient as Andean basins become more densely populated. In summary, our results show that even under a common geology and a climate, stream dynamics of adjacent basins can be starkly different due to topographic and land use drivers.","NA"

Here we present a novel algorithm for identifying regions of synteny in pairs of genetic maps, which is implemented in the accompanying R package, syntR. The syntR algorithm performs as well as previous ad-hoc methods while being systematic, repeatable, and is applicable to mapping chromosomal rearrangements in any group of species. In addition, we present a systematic survey of chromosomal rearrangements in the annual sunflowers, which is a group known for extreme karyotypic diversity. We build high-density genetic maps for two subspecies of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris ssp. petiolaris and H. petiolaris ssp. fallax.

Using syntR, and we identify blocks of synteny between these two subspecies and previously published high-density genetic maps. We reconstruct ancestral karyotypes for annual sunflowers using those synteny blocks and conservatively estimate that there have been 7.9 chromosomal rearrangements per million years - a high rate of chromosomal evolution. Although the rate of inversion is even higher than the rate of translocation in this group, we further find that every extant karyotype is distinguished by between 1 and 3 translocations involving only 8 of the 17 chromosomes. This non-random exchange suggests that specific chromosomes are prone to translocation and may thus contribute disproportionately to widespread hybrid sterility in sunflowers. These data deepen our understanding of chromosome evolution and confirm that Helianthus has an exceptional rate of chromosomal rearrangement that may facilitate similarly rapid diversification.","NA"

Here we use bacterial transposase Tn5, which has been increasingly used in various high-throughput DNA analyses, to construct RNA-seq libraries without second strand synthesis. We show that Tn5 transposome can randomly bind RNA/DNA heteroduplexes and add sequencing adapters onto RNA directly after reverse transcription. This method, Sequencing HEteRo RNA-DNA-hYbrid (SHERRY), is versatile and scalable. SHERRY accepts a wide range of starting materials, from bulk RNA to single cells. SHERRY offers a greatly simplified protocol, and produces results with higher reproducibility and GC uniformity compared with prevailing RNA-seq methods.

Significance StatementRNA sequencing is widely used to measure gene expression in biomedical research; therefore, improvements in the simplicity and accuracy of the technology are desirable. All existing RNA sequencing methods rely on the conversion of RNA into double-stranded DNA through reverse transcription followed by second strand synthesis. The latter step requires additional enzymes and purification, and introduces sequence-dependent bias. Here, we show that Tn5 transposase, which randomly binds and cuts double-stranded DNA, can directly fragment and prime the RNA/DNA heteroduplexes generated by reverse transcription. The primed fragments are then subject to PCR amplification. This provides a new approach for simple and accurate RNA characterization and quantification.","10.1073/pnas.1919800117"

Despite the availability of GT sequences from diverse organisms, the evolutionary basis for their complex and diverse modes of catalytic and regulatory functions remain enigmatic. Here, based on deep mining of over half a million GT-A fold sequences from diverse organisms, we define a minimal core component shared among functionally diverse enzymes. We find that variations in the common core and the emergence of hypervariable loops extending from the core contributed to the evolution of catalytic and functional diversity. We provide a phylogenetic framework relating diverse GT-A fold families for the first time and show that inverting and retaining mechanisms emerged multiple times independently during the course of evolution. We identify conserved modes of donor and acceptor recognition in evolutionarily divergent families and pinpoint the sequence and structural features for functional specialization. Using the evolutionary information encoded in primary sequences, we trained a machine learning classifier to predict donor specificity with nearly 88% accuracy and deployed it for the annotation of understudied GTs in five model organisms. Our studies provide an evolutionary framework for investigating the complex relationships connecting GT-A fold sequence, structure, function and regulation.","10.7554/eLife.54532"

DesignCross-sectional study based on publicly accessible Medicare payment and utilization data from 2012 to 2017.

MethodsFor each ophthalmic and optometric provider, demographic information of treated Medicare beneficiaries was obtained from the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the years 2012 to 2017. Clinical complexity was defined using Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) coding.

ResultsFrom 2012 to 2017, ophthalmologists in every state treated significantly older beneficiaries, with the greatest difference (4.99 years in 2014) between provider groups seen in Rhode Island. In most states, there was no gender difference among patients treated by the providers, but in 46 states ophthalmologists saw significantly more racially diverse groups of beneficiaries. HCC risk score analysis demonstrated that ophthalmologists in all 50 states saw more medically complex beneficiaries and the differences were statistically significant in 47 states throughout all six years.

ConclusionsAlthough there are regional variations in the characteristics of patients treated by ophthalmologists and optometrists, ophthalmologists throughout the United States manage older, more racially diverse, and more medically complex Medicare beneficiaries.","NA"

During the disease process, the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines in the purulent pleural effusion cause proliferation of fibroblasts and deposition of extracellular matrix, which lead to fibrin deposition and fibrothorax. Urokinase instillation therapy through a chest drainage tube is frequently used for fibrinolysis in patients with empyema. However, urokinase treatment requires multiple instillation (2-3 times per day, for 4-8 days) and easily flows out from the chest drainage tube due to its high water solubility. In this in vitro study, we developed a thermo-responsive hydrogel based on poloxamer 407 (P407) combined with hyaluronic acid (HA) for optimal loading and release of urokinase. Our results show that the addition of HA to poloxamer gels provides a significantly more compact microstructure, with smaller pore sizes (**p < 0.001). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profile revealed no influence on the micellization intensity of poloxamer gel by HA. The 25% poloxamer-based gel was significantly superior to the 23% poloxamer-based gel, with slower gel erosion when comparing the 16th hour residual gel weight of both gels (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.001). The 25% poloxamer-HA gel also exhibited a superior urokinase release profile and longer release time. A Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) study of the P407/HA hydrogel showed no chemical interactions between P407 and HA in the hydrogel system. The thermoresponsive P407/HA hydrogel may have a promising potential in the loading and delivery of hydrophilic drugs. On top of that, in vitro toxicity test of this combination demonstrates a lower toxicity.","NA"

Many hormones that take part in homeostatic control come in antagonistic pairs, such as glucagon and insulin reflecting the inflow and outflow compensatory mechanisms to control a certain internal variable, such as blood sugar levels. By including negative feedback loops homeostatic controllers can exhibit oscillations with characteristic frequencies. In this paper we demonstrate the associated frequency changes in homeostatic systems when individual controllers in a set of interlocked feedback loops gain control in response to environmental changes. Taking p53 as an example, we show how the Per2, ATM and Mdm2 feedback loops -interlocked with p53-gain individual control in dependence to DNA damage and how each of these controllers provide certain functionalities in their regulation of p53. In unstressed cells, the circadian regulator Per2 ensures a basic p53 level to allow its rapid up-regulation in case of DNA damage. When DNA damage occurs the ATM controller increases the level of p53 and defends it towards uncontrolled degradation, which despite DNA damage, would drive p53 to lower values and p53 dysfunction. Mdm2 on its side keeps p53 at a maximum level to avoid premature apoptosis. However, with on-going DNA damage the Mdm2 set-point is increased by HSP90 and other p53 stabilizers leading finally to apoptosis. An essential aspect in p53 regulation at occurring cell stress is the coordinated inhibition of ubiquitin-independent and ubiquitin-dependent degradation reactions and the increasing stabilizing mechanisms of p53. Whether oscillations serve a function or are merely a by-product of the controllers are discussed in view of the finding that homeostatic control of p53, as indicated above, does in principle not require oscillatory homeostats.","NA"

This response is mediated by Dux, a multicopy retrogene defining the cleavage-specific transcriptional program in placental mammals. In response to RS, DUX triggers the transcription of 2C-like markers such as murine endogenous retrovirus-like elements (MERVL) and Zscan4. This response can also be elicited by ETAA1-mediated ATR activation in the absence of RS. ATR-mediated activation of DUX requires GSRF1 dependent post-transcriptional regulation of Dux mRNA. Strikingly, activation of ATR expands ESCs fate potential by extending their contribution to both embryonic and extra{-}embryonic tissues.

However, high-resolution measurements of molecular heights on native cell membranes have been difficult to obtain. Here we present a simple and rapid method that achieves nanometer height resolution by localizing fluorophores at the tip and base of cell surface molecules and determining their separation by radially averaging across many molecules. We use this method, which we call cell surface optical profilometry (CSOP), to quantify height of key multi-domain proteins on a model macrophage and cancer cell, as well as to capture average protein and glycan heights on native cell membranes. We show that average height of a protein is significantly smaller than its contour length due to thermally driven bending and rotation on the membrane and that height strongly depends on local surface and solution conditions. We find that average height increases with cell surface molecular crowding, while it decreases with solution crowding by solutes, both of which we confirm with molecular dynamics simulations. We also use experiments and simulations to determine the height of an epitope based on the location of an antibody, which allows CSOP to profile various proteins and glycans on a native cell surface using antibodies and lectins. This versatile method for profiling cell surfaces has the potential to advance understanding of the molecular landscape of cells and its role in cell function.","NA"

Euplotid (http://dborgesr.github.io/Euplotid/) is a quantized geometric model of the eukaryotic cell, an attempt at quantifying the incredible complexity that gives rise to a living cell by beginning from the smallest unit, a quanta. Starting from the very bottom we are able to build the pieces which when hierarchically and combinatorially combined produce the emergent complex behavior that even a single celled organism can show. Euplotid is composed of a set of quantized geometric 3D building blocks and constantly evolving dockerized bioinformatic pipelines enabling a user to build and interact with the local regulatory architecture of every gene starting from DNA-interactions, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-sequencing. Reads are quantified using the latest computational tools and the results are normalized, quality-checked, and stored. The local regulatory architecture of each gene is built using a Louvain based graph partitioning algorithm parameterized by the chromatin extrusion model and CTCF-CTCF interactions. Cis-Regulatory Elements are defined using chromatin accessibility peaks which are mapped to Transcriptional Start Sites based on inclusion within the same neighborhood. Deep Neural Networks are trained in order to provide a statistical model mimicking transcription factor binding, giving the ability to identify all Transcription Factors within a given chromatin accessibility peak. By in-silico mutating and re-applying the neural network we are able to gauge the impact of a transition mutation on the binding of any transcription factor. The annotated output can be visualized in a variety of 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D ways overlaid with existing bodies of knowledge such as GWAS results or PDB structures. Once a particular CRE of interest has been identified a Base Editor mediated transition mutation can then be performed in a relevant model for further study.

We first analyzed histone H3 and H4 modifications during the cell cycle. Levels of active marks, such as acetylation and H3K4 methylation, were increased during the S phase, in association with chromatin duplication. By contrast, levels of some repressive modifications gradually increased during the G2 and the next G1 phases. We applied this method to validate the target modifications of various histone demethylases in cells using a transient overexpression system. We also screened chemical compounds in marine organism extracts that affect histone modifications and identified psammaplin A, which was previously reported to inhibit histone deacetylases.

Overall, more feeding clusters, containing more larval participants were observed in the higher density vials compared to the lower density vials, consistent with the idea that this social behaviour is a response to dwindling resources in the environment.

L.; Mathur, R.; Kaiser, P.","Peter Kaiser","University of California, Irvine","2020-01-02",2,"cc_no","new results","biochemistry","Organisms can adapt to a broad spectrum of sudden and dramatic changes in their environment. These abrupt changes are often perceived as stress and trigger responses that facilitate survival and eventual adaptation. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is involved in most cellular processes. Unsurprisingly, components of the UPS also play crucial roles during various stress response programs. The budding yeast SCFMet30 complex is an essential Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase that connects metabolic and heavy metal stress to cell cycle regulation. Cadmium exposure results in the active dissociation of the F-box protein Met30 from the core ligase leading to SCFMet30 inactivation. Consequently, SCFMet30 substrate ubiquitylation is blocked and triggers a downstream cascade to activate a specific transcriptional stress response program. Signal-induced dissociation is initiated by autoubiquitylation of Met30 and serves as a recruitment signal for the AAA-ATPase Cdc48/p97, which actively disassembles the complex. Here we show that the UBX cofactor Shp1/p47 is an additional key element for SCFMet30 disassembly during heavy metal stress. Although the cofactor can directly interact with the ATPase, Cdc48 and Shp1 are recruited independently to SCFMet30 during cadmium stress. An intact UBX domain is crucial for effective SCFMet30 disassembly, and a concentration threshold of Shp1 recruited to SCFMet30 needs to be exceeded to initiate Met30 dissociation. The latter is likely related to Shp1-mediated control of Cdc48 ATPase activity. This study identifies Shp1 as the crucial Cdc48 cofactor for signal-induced, selective disassembly of a multi-subunit protein complex to modulate activity.

Significance StatementUbiquitylation affects many important cellular processes, and has been linked to a number of human diseases. It has become a synonym for protein degradation, but ubiquitylation also has important non-proteolytic signaling functions. Understanding the molecular concepts that govern ubiquitin signaling is of great importance for development of diagnostics and therapeutics. The cadmium-induced inactivation of the SCFMet30 ubiquitin ligase via the disassembly of the multi-subunit ligase complex, illustrates an example for non-proteolytic signaling pathways. Dissociation is triggered by autoubiquitylation of the F-box protein Met30, which is the recruiting signal for the highly conserved AAA-ATPase Cdc48/p97. Here we show that the UBX cofactor Shp1/p47 is important for this ubiquitin-dependent, active remodeling of a multi-protein complex in response to a specific environmental signal.","NA"

However, sex differences in central pain sensitization and the regulation of nociceptive response to peripheral inflammation remain unclear. The central pain sensitization is mediated by inhibitory neurotransmission and glial cell activity dysregulation where spinal glycine and GLP-1 receptors have described play a critical role.

ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to compare the mechanical withdrawal nociceptive threshold with spinal glycine receptor subunits and GLP-1 expression in adult male and female rats after inflammatory hypersensitivity.

MethodsSex differences in inflammatory nociception were evaluated before and after intraplantar hindpaw Zymosan A injection in Sprague-Dawley rats. Mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds were tested using von Frey filaments.

Western blot was used to measure GlyRs subunits protein levels in the spinal cord. GLP-1 was determined using the Magnetic Luminex Assay.

ResultsA reduced nociceptive threshold was observed in males and females rats after 4 hours of inflammatory Zymosan A injection. However, this reduction was significantly major in females. Western blot analysis demonstrated significantly increased 1, 2, 3 and {beta} GlyR subunit levels in male rats. Female rats only increased 3 and {beta} GlyR subunits after Zymosan A injection. GLP-1 was reduced in female spinal tissues after an inflammatory injury.

ConclusionsOur study indicates that sex differences in nociceptive threshold after inflammatory Zymosan A rat pain sensitization is related to the sex differences in glycine receptor subunits and GLP-1 expression at the spinal cord.","NA"

However, despite a long history of theoretical effort, electroporation protocols are still based on trial and error because the biomolecular structures and mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been established. Electroporation models, developed to explain observations of electrical breakdown of lipid membranes, describe the electric field-driven formation of pores in lipid bilayers. These transient pore models are consistent with molecular dynamics simulations, where field-stabilized lipid pores form within a few nanoseconds and collapse within tens of nanoseconds after the field is removed. Here we experimentally validate this nanoscale restructuring of bio-membranes by measuring the kinetics of transport of the impermeant fluorescent dye calcein into lipid vesicles exposed to ultrashort electric fields (6 ns and 2 ns), and by comparing these results to molecular simulations. Molecular transport after vesicle permeabilization induced by multiple pulses is additive for interpulse intervals as short as 50 ns, while the additive property of transport is no longer observed when the interval is reduced to 0 ns, consistent with the lifetimes of lipid electropores in molecular simulations. These results show that lipid vesicle responses to pulsed electric fields are significantly different from those of living cells where, for similar pulse properties, the uptake of fluorescent dye continues for several minutes.

The olfactory system is therefore faced with the task of segmenting odor mixtures to identify objects in the presence of rich and often unpredictable backgrounds. The piriform cortex is thought to be the site of object recognition and scene segmentation, yet the nature of its responses to odorant mixtures is largely unknown. In this study, we asked two related questions. 1) How do mixture representations in the piriform cortex relate to the representations of individual mixture components? And 2) Can the identity of individual mixture components be read out from mixture representations in the piriform cortex? To answer these questions, we recorded single unit activity in the piriform cortex of naive mice while sequentially presenting single odorants and their mixtures. We find that the magnitude of piriform cortical responses increases with added mixture components, and that the responses of individual neurons are typically well explained by a normalization model. Finally, we show that mixture components can be identified from piriform cortical activity by pooling responses of a small population of neurons. These results suggest that piriform cortical representations are well suited to perform figure-background segmentation without the need for learning.

Significance statementOlfactory research has mainly focused on the encoding and processing of individual isolated odors. However, stimuli in nature are never in isolation. It is currently unknown how the olfactory system processes complex stimuli and how it identifies specific odors embedded in varying backgrounds. In this study we analyzed piriform cortical responses to odorant mixtures. We find that mixture responses can typically be described with a simple normalization model. We also show that the activity of small populations of piriform neurons and often even individual neurons can provide sufficient information for identifying odorants embedded within background mixtures. This suggests that segmentation of target odors from the background is a built-in feature of piriform cortical processing.","NA"

We have previously identified such responses within hippocampal place cells [1], the activity of which is thought to aid memory-guided behavior by forming a mental map of an animals environment that can be reshaped through experience [2-7]. It remains unknown, however, whether taste-responsiveness is intrinsic to a subset of place cells, or emerges as a result of experience that reorganizes spatial maps. Here, we recorded from neurons in the dorsal CA1 region of rats running for palatable tastes delivered via intra-oral cannulae at specific locations on a linear track. We identified a subset of taste-responsive cells that, even prior to taste exposure, had larger place fields than non-taste-responsive cells overlapping with stimulus delivery zones. Taste-responsive cells place fields then contracted, as a result of taste experience, leading to a stronger representation of stimulus delivery zones on the track. Taste-responsive units exhibited increased sharp-wave ripple co-activation during the taste delivery session and subsequent rest periods, which correlated with the degree of place field contraction. Our results reveal that novel taste experience evokes responses within a preconfigured network of taste-responsive hippocampal place cells with large fields, whose spatial representations are refined by sensory experience to signal areas of behavioral salience.

Our study combined individual differences in experience sampling, psychophysical reports of perception, and neuroimaging descriptions of structural connectivity, to better understand these changes in conscious awareness. In particular, we (a) examined if aspects of ongoing thought, as measured by multi-dimensional experience sampling during a sustained attention task, are associated with the white matter fibre organization of the cortex as reflected by their relative degree of anisotropic diffusion, and (b) whether these neuro-cognitive descriptions of ongoing experience are related to a more constrained measure of visual consciousness provided by the analysis of bistable perception during binocular rivalry. Individuals with greater fractional anisotropy (FA) in right hemisphere white matter regions involving the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the cortico-spinal tract, described their ongoing thoughts as lacking external details. Subsequent analysis indicated that the combination of low FA in these right hemisphere regions, with reports of high level external details, was associated with the shortest periods of dominance during binocular rivalry. Since variation in binocular rivalry reflects differences between bottom-up and top-down influences on vision, our study suggests that reports of ongoing thoughts with vivid external details may occur when conscious precedence is given to bottom-up representation of perceptual information and that this may partly be rooted in the white matter fibre organization of the cortex.","NA"

Nested cross-validation (nCV) is a common approach that chooses the classification model and features to represent a given outer fold based on features that give the maximum inner-fold accuracy. Differential privacy is a related technique to avoid overfitting that uses a privacy preserving noise mechanism to identify features that are stable between training and holdout sets.

MethodsWe develop consensus nested CV (cnCV) that combines the idea of feature stability from differential privacy with nested CV. Feature selection is applied in each inner fold and the consensus of top features across folds is a used as a measure of feature stability or reliability instead of classification accuracy, which is used in standard nCV. We use simulated data with main effects, correlation, and interactions to compare the classification accuracy and feature selection performance of the new cnCV with standard nCV, Elastic Net optimized by CV, differential privacy, and private Evaporative Cooling (pEC). We also compare these methods using real RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder.

ResultsThe cnCV method has similar training and validation accuracy to nCV, but cnCV has much shorter run times because it does not construct classifiers in the inner folds. The cnCV method chooses a more parsimonious set of features with fewer false positives than nCV. The cnCV method has similar accuracy to pEC and cnCV selects stable features between folds without the need to specify a privacy threshold. We show that cnCV is an effective and efficient approach for combining feature selection with classification.

High-throughput sequencing of DNA amplicons (metabarcoding) is potentially a rapid and cost-effective method to monitor early life-stages for management and environmental impact assessment purposes. Yet, there is conflicting information about the quantitative capability of metabarcoding. We compared metabarcoding with traditional morphological identification to evaluate taxonomic precision and reliability of abundance estimates, using 332 fish larvae from multinet hauls (0-50m depth) collected at 14 offshore sampling sites in the Irish and Celtic seas. To improve relative abundance estimates, the amount of tissue for each specimen was standardised and mitochondrial primers with conserved binding sites were used. Family level correction factors for amplification bias and back-calculations were applied to estimate numbers of individuals of a given taxon in a sample. Estimates from metabarcoding reads and morphological assessment were positively correlated for relative family abundances as well as taxon richness (Rs=0.81, P=0.007) and diversity (Rs=0.88, P=0.003). After applying family level correction, back-estimates of the number of individuals per family within a sample were accurate to {+/-} 2 individuals. Spatial patterns of community composition did not differ significantly between metabarcoding and morphological assessments.

Our results show that DNA metabarcoding of bulk tissue samples can be used to monitor changes in fish larvae abundance and community composition. This represents a feasible, efficient and faster alternative to morphological identification that can be applied to terrestrial and aquatic habitats.","NA"

Their distributions in ForCenS, a database of species in seafloor sediment are studied as a proxy for upper ocean data and are analysed as occurrences using MaxEnt, and as relative abundances via non-parametric regression (Random Forests). Their distributions are similar and their co-occurrences are high but relations between their abundances and the environmental variables are complex and non-linear. In the occurrence analysis sea surface temperature is the strongest predictor of niche suitability, followed by chlorophyll-a; environments between 0 - 20{degrees} S are mapped as the most suitable for both species. To the contrary, predicted species distributions are strongly differentiated by the abundance analysis. Nitrate and chlorophyll-a are primary variables in the map of predicted relative abundances of Globigerinoides ruber, with maxima in the hyper-oligotrophic zone of the subtropical gyre. In contrast, sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a are primary variables in the map for Trilobatus sacculifer and predicted maxima are at the margins of the hyper-oligotrophic zone and near the West Pacific Warm Pool. The high relative abundance of Globigerinoides ruber in the hyper-oligotrophic zone is attributed to its close photosymbiotic relation with on-board dinoflagellates; this compensates for the low primary productivity in the zone. It is clearly identified as the best-adapted planktonic foraminifer in this huge marine  desert and might serve as a useful proxy.

Understanding how these decision-making processes and underlying neural computations are orchestrated by the structural components of the brain, from circuits to cells, and ultimately the signaling complex of proteins at synapses, is central to elucidating the mechanisms that shape normal and abnormal brain connectivity, plasticity and behavior. At excitatory synapses, neuroligin-1 (Nlgn1) a postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule required for the formation of trans-synaptic complexes with presynaptic partners is critical for regulating synapse specification, function and plasticity. Extensive evidence shows Nlgn1 is essential for synaptic transmission and long-term plasticity, but how these signaling processes ultimately regulate components of cognitive behavior is much less understood. Here, employing a comprehensive battery of touchscreen-based cognitive assays, we measured two key decision problems: i) the ability to learn and exploit the associative structure of the environment and ii) the trade-off between potential rewards and costs, or positive and negative utilities associated with available actions. We found that mice lacking Nlgn1 have an intact capacity to acquire complex associative structures and adjust learned associations. However, loss of Nlgn1 alters motivation leading to a reduced willingness to overcome response effort for reward and an increased willingness to exert effort to escape an aversive situation. We suggest Nlgn1 may be important for balancing the weighting on positive and negative utilities in reward-cost trade-off. Our findings identify Nlgn1 is essential for regulating distinct cognitive processes underlying decision-making, providing evidence of a new model for dissociating the computations underlying learning and motivational processing.","NA"

Furthermore, our results suggest that the same visual features underlie both material recognition and surface gloss perception. However, the predictiveness of each feature to perceived gloss changes with material category, suggesting that the pockets of feature space occupied by different material classes affect the processing of those very features when estimating surface glossiness. Our results do not support a traditional feedforward view that assumes that material perception proceeds from low-level image measurements, to mid-level estimates of surface properties, to high-level material classes, nor the idea that material properties like gloss and material class are simultaneously ""read out"" from visual gloss features.

Unnatural light signals disrupt circadian rhythms and physiology and behavior. Real-time light responses of mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus are unmeasurable at single cell resolution. We compared Drosophila whole-circadian circuit responses between unshifted daytime/nighttime schedule and a 3hr WLS schedule at the single-cell resolution in cultured adult Drosophila brains using real-time bioluminescence imaging of the PERIOD protein for 11 days to determine how light shifts alter biological clock entrainment and stability. We find that circadian circuits show highly synchronous oscillations across all major circadian neuronal subgroups in unshifted light schedules. In contrast, circadian circuits exposed to a WLS schedule show significantly dampened oscillator synchrony and rhythmicity in most circadian neurons during, and after exposure. The WLS schedule first desynchronizes lateral ventral neuron (LNv) oscillations and the LNv are the last to resynchronize upon returning to a simulated weekday schedule. Surprisingly, one circadian subgroup, the dorsal neuron group-3 (DN3s), robustly increase their within-group synchrony in response to WLS exposure. Intact adult flies exposed to the WLS schedule show post-WLS transient defects in sleep stability, learning, and memory. Our findings suggest that WLS schedules disrupt circuit-wide circadian neuronal oscillator synchrony for much of the week, thus leading to observed behavioral defects in sleep, learning, and memory.

Significance StatementThe circadian clock controls numerous aspects of daily animal physiology, metabolism and behavior. Shift work in humans is harmful. Our understanding of circadian circuit-level oscillations stem from ex vivo imaging of mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) brain slices. However, our knowledge is limited to investigations without direct interrogation of phase-shifting light signals. We measured circuit-level circadian responses to a WLS protocol in light sensitive ex vivo Drosophila whole-brain preparation and find robust sub-circuit-specific oscillator desynchrony/resynchrony responses to light. These circuit-level behaviors correspond to our observed functional defects in learning and memory, and sleep pattern disruption in vivo. Our results reflect that WLS cause circadian-circuit desynchronization and correlate with disrupted cognitive and sleep performance.","NA"

The previous algorithms were challenged to correctly predict physiological experiment results and the two types of motion: a) Phi motion, also termed apparent motion. b) Reverse-phi motion that is perceived when the image contrast flips during the rapid succession. We have developed a computational model supported by simulations, which for the first time leads to correct predictions of the behavioral motions (phi and reverse-phi), while considering separated On and Off pathways and is also in agreement with the relevant electrophysiological findings. This has been achieved through the well-known neuronal response: the rebound response or ""Off response"".

Clustering identifies five well-delineated subsets, including two medullary sinus subsets not recognized previously as distinct. Nearest neighbor alignments in trajectory space position the major subsets in a sequence that recapitulates known and suggests novel features of LN lymphatic organization, providing a transcriptional map of the lymphatic endothelial niches and of the transitions between them. Differences in gene expression reveal specialized programs for (1) subcapsular ceiling endothelial interactions with the capsule connective tissue and cells, (2) subcapsular floor regulation of lymph borne cell entry into the LN parenchyma and antigen presentation, and (3) medullary subset specialization for pathogen interactions and LN remodeling. LEC of the subcapsular sinus floor and medulla, which represent major sites of cell entry and exit from the LN parenchyma respectively, respond robustly to oxazolone inflammation challenge with enriched signaling pathways that converge on both innate and adaptive immune responses. Integration of mouse and human single-cell profiles reveals a conserved cross-species pattern of lymphatic vascular niches and gene expression, as well as specialized human subsets and genes unique to each species. The examples provided demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis in elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, vascular organization and endothelial cell responses.

In particular, brain xenobiotic protection and endobiotic regulatory systems that require transcriptional coordination across different cell types, operating in parallel with the primary nervous system and metabolic functions of each cell type, are still poorly understood. Here we use the unsupervised machine learning method independent component analysis (ICA) on majority fresh-frozen, bulk tissue microarrays to define biologically pertinent gene expression signatures which are sparse, i.e. each involving only a fraction of all fly genes. We optimize the gene expression signature definitions partly through repeated application of a stochastic ICA algorithm to a compendium of 3,346 microarrays from 221 experiments provided by the Drosophila research community. Our optimized ICA model of pan fly gene expression consists of 850 modules of co-regulated genes that map to tissue developmental stages, disease states, cell-autonomous pathways and presumably novel processes. Importantly, we show biologically relevant gene modules expressed at varying amplitudes in whole brain and isolated adult blood-brain barrier cell levels. Thus, whole tissue derived ICA transcriptional signatures that transcend single cell type boundaries provide a window into the transcriptional states of difficult to isolate cell ensembles maintaining delicate brain physiologies.

This apparent paradox poses major challenges to malaria elimination in highly endemic regions, where asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections are present across all age classes creating a large reservoir that maintains transmission. This reservoir is in turn enabled by extreme antigenic diversity of the parasite and turnover of new variants. We present here the concept of a threshold in local pathogen diversification that defines a sharp transition in transmission intensity below which new variants generated by either recombination or migration cannot establish. Transmission still occurs below this threshold but parasite diversity can neither accumulate, nor recover, from interventions that further reduce it. An analytical expectation for this threshold is derived and compared to numerical results from a stochastic individual-based model of malaria transmission that incorporates the major antigen-encoding multigene family known as var. This threshold we call Rdiv; it is complementary to the one defined by the classic basic reproductive number of infectious diseases, R0, which does not easily apply under large and dynamic strain diversity. This new threshold concept should be exploited for effective malaria control and applied more broadly to other pathogens with large multilocus antigenic diversity.

Significance StatementThe vast diversity of falciparum malaria as seen by the immune system underlies only partial protection to re-infection and many infections lacking symptoms in high transmission regions. Large antigenic parasite diversity challenges control efforts and the associated application of the classic reproductive number (known as R0) because strains cannot be clearly defined. We propose a complementary number, Rdiv, measuring the potential of transmission to accumulate new antigenic variation over time. When Rdiv is pushed below one, new genes encoding this variation cannot accumulate resulting in a low number of strains and facilitating further intervention. The reproductive number for antigenic diversification can be applied to other infectious diseases with fast turnover of antigens, where large standing diversity similarly opposes successful control.","NA"

Brucella establish chronic infections within host macrophages despite triggering cytosolic innate immune sensors, including Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), which potentially limit infection. In this study, STING was required for control of chronic Brucella infection in vivo. However, early during infection, Brucella down-regulated STING mRNA and protein. Down-regulation occurred post-transcriptionally, required live bacteria, the Brucella type IV secretion system, and was independent of host IRE1-RNase activity. Rather, Brucella induced a STING-targeting microRNA, miR-24-2. Furthermore, STING downregulation was inhibited by miR-24 anti-miRs and in mirn23a locus-deficient macrophages. Failure to suppress STING expression in mirn23a-/- macrophages correlated with diminished Brucella replication, and was rescued by exogenous miR-24. Anti-miR-24 potently suppressed replication in wild type, but much less in STING-/- macrophages, suggesting most of the impact of miR-24 induction on replication occurred via STING suppression. In summary, Brucella sabotages innate immunity by miR-24-dependent suppression of STING expression; post-STING activation ""damage control"" via targeted STING destruction may enable establishment of chronic infection.

Author summaryCytosolic pattern recognition receptors, such as the nucleotide-activated STING molecule, play a critical role in the innate immune system by detecting the presence of intracellular invaders. Brucella bacterial species establish chronic infections in macrophages despite initially activating STING. STING does participate in the control of Brucella infection, as mice or cells lacking STING show a higher burden of Brucella infection. However, we have found that early following infection, Brucella upregulates a microRNA, miR-24, that targets the STING messenger RNA, resulting in lower STING levels. Dead bacteria or bacteria lacking a functional type IV secretion system were defective at upregulating miR-24 and STING suppression, suggesting an active bacteria-driven process. Failure to upregulate miR-24 and suppress STING greatly compromised the capacity for Brucella to replicate inside macrophages. Thus, although Brucella initially activate STING during infection, the ensuing STING downregulation serves as a ""damage control"" mechanism, enabling intracellular infection. Viruses have long been known to target immune sensors such as STING. Our results indicate that intracellular bacterial pathogens also directly target innate immune receptors to enhance their infectious success.","NA"

How does this divergence to a face-specific and an object-general system contribute to face recognition? Recent advances in machine face recognition together with our understanding of how humans recognize faces enable us to address this fundamental question. We hypothesized that face recognition depends on a face-selective system that is tuned to view-invariant facial features, which cannot be accomplished by an object-general system. To test this hypothesis, we used deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that were optimized for face or object recognition. Consistent with the hierarchical architecture of the visual system, results show that a human-like, view-invariant face representation emerges only at higher layers of a face-trained but not the object-trained neural network. Thus, by combining human psychophysics and computational modelling of the visual system, we revealed how the functional organization of the visual cortex may contribute to recognition.","NA"

We found in total 147 circRNAs to be differentially expressed (DE) during AD progression in the four regions. We also characterized the mRNA-circRNA co-expression network and annotated the potential function of circRNAs based on the co-expressed modules. Based on our results, we propose that parahippocampal gyrus is the most circRNA-regulated region during the AD progression. The strongest negatively AD stage-correlated module in parahippocampal gyrus were enriched in cognitive disability and pathological-associated pathways such as synapse organization and regulation of membrane potential. Finally, the regression model based on the expression pattern of DE circRNAs in the module could help to distinguish the disease severity of patients, further supported the importance of circRNAs in AD pathology.

We discovered that all six tau isoforms are capable of forming PHF-tau like filaments and the 3R tau isoforms aggregate significantly faster than their 4R counterparts. We further mapped key segments of tau isoforms that contribute to their aggregation kinetics, where it was determined that microtubule binding domains R2 and R3 were the major contributors to tau aggregation.

Dimerization/oligomerization generated by transmembrane domains (TMDs) appear to crucially regulate several functional behaviors of all syndecan members. The distinct hierarchy of protein-protein interactions mediated by the syndecan TMDs may give rise to considerable complexity in the functions of syndecans. The molecular mechanism of the different dimerization tendencies in each type of SDCs remains unclear. Here, the self-assembly process of syndecan TMD homodimers and heterodimers was studied in molecular details by molecular dynamics simulations. Our computational results showed that the SDC2 forms the most stable homodimer while the SDC1 TMD dimerizes weakly, which is consistent with previous experimental results. Detailed analysis suggests that instead of the conserved dimerizing motif G8XXXG12 in all four SDCs involved in homo- and hetero-dimerization of SDCs, the G3XXXA7 motif in SDC1 competes with the interface of G8XXXG12 and thus disturbs the SDC1 involved dimerization. The SDC3 which contains a G9XXXA13 motif, however, forms a more stable dimer than SDC1, indicating the complexity of the competing effect of the GXXXA motif. As GXXXG and GXXXA are two common sequence motifs in the dimerization of helices, our results shed light on the competing effect of multiple dimerizing motifs on the dimerization of transmembrane domains.","NA"

However, most human lncRNAs are non-conserved, vastly limiting our ability to identify human lncRNA metabolic regulators (hLMRs). As the sequence-function relation of lncRNAs has yet to be established, the identification of lncRNA metabolic regulators in animals often relies on their regulations by experimental metabolic conditions. But it is very challenging to apply this strategy to human lncRNAs because well-controlled human data are much limited in scope and often confounded by genetic heterogeneity. In this study, we establish an efficient pipeline to identify putative hLMRs that are metabolically sensitive, disease-relevant, and population applicable. We first progressively processed human transcriptome data to select human liver lncRNAs that exhibit highly dynamic expression in the general population, show differential expression in a metabolic disease population, and response to dietary intervention in a small disease cohort. We then experimentally demonstrated the responsiveness of selected hepatic lncRNAs to defined metabolic milieus in a liver-specific humanized mouse model. Furthermore, by extracting a concise list of protein-coding genes that are persistently correlated with lncRNAs in general and metabolic disease populations, we predicted the specific function for each hLMR. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches in humanized mice as well as ectopic expression in conventional mice, we were able to validate the regulatory role of one non-conserved hLMR in cholesterol metabolism. Mechanistically, this hLMR binds to an RNA-binding protein, PTBP1, to modulate the transcription of cholesterol synthesis genes. In summary, our study provides a pipeline to overcome the variabilities intrinsic to human data to enable the efficient identification and functional definition of hLMRs. The combination of this bioinformatic framework and humanized murine model will enable broader systematic investigation of the physiological role of disease-relevant human lncRNAs in metabolic homeostasis.","NA"

These events are predominantly mediated by integrins, the principal cellular adhesion receptors located at the cell/extracellular matrix (ECM) interface.

Because of the typical piconewton force range and nanometre length scale of mechanotransductive interactions, achieving a detailed understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics occurring at the cell/microenvironment interface is challenging; sophisticated interdisciplinary methodologies are required. Moreover, an accurate control over the nanotopographical features of the microenvironment is essential, in order to systematically investigate and precisely assess the influence of the different nanotopographical motifs on the mechanotransductive process.

In this framework, we were able to study and quantify the impact of microenvironmental nanotopography on early cellular adhesion events by means of adhesion force spectroscopy based on innovative colloidal probes mimicking the nanotopography of natural ECMs.

These probes provided the opportunity to detect nanotopography-specific modulations of the molecular force loading dynamics and integrin clustering at the level of single binding events, in the critical time window of nascent adhesion formation. Following this approach, we found that the nanotopographical features are responsible for an excessive force loading in single adhesion sites after 20 - 60 s of interaction, causing a drop in the number of adhesion sites. However, by manganese treatment we demonstrated that the availability of activated integrins is a critical regulatory factor for these nanotopography-dependent dynamics.","NA"

Using differential gene expression data from the Expression Atlas database, we identify the key components of glucose uptake in cancer, in order to guide the construction of a mathematical model. By simulations of this model we show that while negative feedback from downstream glycolytic metabolites to glucose transporters is sufficient for homeostatic control of glycolysis in a constant cellular volume, it is necessary to control intermediate glycolytic enzymes in order to achieve homeostatic control during growth.

The desire to map and quantify these interactions has resulted in the development of increased throughput quantitative measurement techniques, such as microarray or plate-based fluorescence polarization assays. For example, in the last 15 years, experiments have progressed from measuring single interactions to having covering 500,000 of the 5.5 million possible SH2-pTyr interactions in the human proteome. However, high variability in affinity measurements and disagreements about positive interactions between published datasets led us to re-evaluate the analysis pipelines of published SH2-pTyr datasets. We identified several opportunities for improving the identification of positive and negative interactions, and the accuracy of affinity measurements. These methods account for protein aggregation and degradation, and use model fitting and evaluation that are more appropriate for the non-linear behavior of binding interaction data. In addition to improve affinity accuracy, and increased certainty in negative interactions, we find the reanalyzed data results in significantly improved classification of binding vs non-binding when using machine learning techniques, suggesting improved coherence in the reanalyzed datasets.

Standard methods for estimating demographic parameters from noninvasive genetic samples are inefficient because lower quality samples cannot be used, and they do not allow for errors in individual identification. We introduce the Genotype Spatial Partial Identity Model (SPIM), which integrates a genetic classification model with a spatial population model to combine both spatial and genetic information, thus reducing genotype uncertainty and increasing the precision of demographic parameter estimates. We apply this model to data from a study of fishers (Pekania pennanti) in which 37% of samples were originally discarded because of uncertainty in individual identity. The Genotype SPIM density estimate using all collected samples was 25% more precise than the original density estimate, and the model identified and corrected 3 errors in the original individual identity assignments. A simulation study demonstrated that our model increased the accuracy and precision of density estimates 63% and 42%, respectively, using 3 PCRs per genetic sample. Further, the simulations showed that the Genotype SPIM model parameters are identifiable with only one PCR per sample, and that accuracy and precision are relatively insensitive to the number of PCRs for high quality samples. Current genotyping protocols devote the majority of resources to replicating and confirming high quality samples, but when using the Genotype SPIM, genotyping protocols could be more efficient by devoting more resources to low quality samples.

SignificanceWe present a new statistical framework for the estimation of animal demographic parameters, such as abundance, density, and growth rate, from noninvasive genetic samples (e.g., hair, scat). By integrating a genetic classification model with a spatial population model, we show that accounting for spatial proximity of samples reduces genotype uncertainty and improves parameter estimation. Our method produces a fundamentally different approach to genetic capture-recapture by sharing information between the normally disjunct steps of assigning individual identities to genetic samples and modeling population processes. Further, it leads to more efficient protocols for processing genetic samples, which can lower project costs and expand opportunities for applying noninvasive genetics to conservation and management problems.","NA"

The HPA axis is dysregulated in chronic stress and psychiatric disorders, but the origin of this dysregulation is unclear and cannot be explained by current HPA models. To address this, we developed a new mathematical model for the HPA axis that incorporates changes in the total functional mass of the HPA hormone-secreting glands. The mass changes are caused by the HPA hormones which act as growth factors for the glands in the axis. We find that the HPA axis shows the property of dynamical compensation, where gland masses adjust over weeks to buffer variation in physiological parameters. These mass changes explain the experimental findings on dysregulation of cortisol and ACTH dynamics in alcoholism, anorexia and postpartum. Dysregulation occurs for a wide range of parameters, and is exacerbated by impaired glucocorticoid receptor (GR) feedback, providing an explanation for the implication of GR in mood disorders. These findings suggest that gland-mass dynamics may play an important role in the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders.

Author SummaryThe HPA axis is a neuroendocrine axis that is activated in response to stressors. The classical description of this axis includes three hormones that act in a cascade, with the final hormone cortisol inhibiting the two upstream hormones, ACTH and CRH. This classical picture has timescales of hours due to hormone half-lives, and cannot explain phenomena on the scale of weeks to months associated with this axis, such as the dysregulation observed in depression, alcohol addiction, postpartum, and other conditions. Here, we use a minimal-model approach to add to the classical model two known interactions in which CRH and ACTH not only regulate downstream hormones, but also act as growth factors for the cells that secrete these hormones. This creates a physiological circuit that can maintain total cell mass and buffer parameter changes. It has a fragility in which after prolonged stress, the total cell functional masses grow and take weeks to return to baseline. This is sufficient to explain the specific dynamics of hormone dysregulation found in several contexts. It also quantifies the effect of the cortisol (glucocorticoid) receptor on resilience to prolonged stress. Our findings suggest that interactions between hormones and cell functional mass may play an important role in HPA axis regulation on the timescale of weeks to months.

The HPA axis helps the body adapt to stress, but becomes dysregulated after prolonged activation, with clinical consequences. The origin of this dysregulation is unclear. We provide a mechanism for dysregulation based on the effect of the HPA hormones as growth factors for their downstream glands. O_LIA mathematical model that includes gland functional mass dynamics, introduces a new slow timescale of weeks to the HPA axis; previous models had only fast timescales of hours.
C_LIO_LIThe gland masses grow during prolonged activation, providing dynamical compensation, and recover with overshoots over weeks after withdrawal of activation.
C_LIO_LIThese overshoots are sufficient to explain the observed HPA dysregulation in pathological conditions, and clarify the role of glucocorticoid receptors in resilience to prolonged stress.

Intermittent emissions create multiple localizations belonging to the same molecule, resulting in blinking-artifacts within SMLM images. These artifacts are often interpreted as true biological assemblies, confounding quantitative analyses and interpretations. Multiple methods have been developed to eliminate these artifacts, but they either require additional experiments, arbitrary thresholds, or specific photo-kinetic models. Here we present a method, termed Distance Distribution Correction (DDC), to eliminate blinking-caused repeat localizations without any additional calibrations. The approach relies on the finding that the true pairwise distance distribution of different fluorophores in an SMLM image can be naturally obtained from the imaging sequence by using distances between localizations separated by a time much longer than the average fluorescence survival time. We show that using the true pairwise distribution we can define and then maximize the likelihood of obtaining a particular set of localizations void of blinking-artifacts, generating an accurate reconstruction of the underlying cellular structure. Using both simulated and experimental data, we show that DDC surpasses all previous existing blinking-artifact correction methodologies, resulting in drastic improvements in obtaining the closest estimate of the true spatial organization and number of fluorescent emitters in a wide range of applications. The simplicity and robustness of DDC will allow it to become the field standard in SMLM imaging, enabling the most accurate reconstruction and quantification of SMLM images to date.","NA"

BiPs essential functions in facilitating proper protein folding are mainly mediated through its dynamic interaction with unfolded or misfolded client proteins, and by serving as a negative regulator of the Unfolded Protein Response. A mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of BiP interaction with its protein partners is essential to understand ER biology, and therefore, we have sought to develop a tractable model to study misfolded protein interaction with BiP. For this purpose, we have used homologous recombination to insert a 3xFLAG epitope tag into the endogenous murine Hspa5 gene, just upstream from the essential KDEL signal necessary for ER localization of BiP. Tagging BiP in this way did not alter Hspa5 expression under basal or ER-stress induced conditions in hepatocytes ex vivo or in fibroblasts. Furthermore, the tag did not alter the cellular localization of BiP or its functionality. All of these findings in primary tissue culture were also confirmed in vivo in livers of heterozygous mice with one WT and one FLAG-tagged Hspa5 allele. Hepatocyte-specific BiP-FLAG modification did not alter liver function or UPR signaling. Importantly, immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody completely pulled down FLAG-tagged BiP from lysates of BiP-FLAG expressing livers. In summary, we generated a novel model that can be used to investigate the BiP interactome in vivo under physiological and pathophysiological conditions in a cell type-specific manner. This tool has the capability, for the first time, to provide an unbiased approach to identify unfolded and misfolded BiP-client proteins, and to provide new information on the role of BiP in many essential ER processes.","NA"

To formally test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the pain-free, resting alpha frequency of healthy individuals and their subsequent sensitivity to two experimental models of prolonged pain, Phasic Heat Pain and Capsaicin Heat Pain, at two testing visits separated by 8 weeks on average (n = 61 Visit 1, n = 46 Visit 2).

Though sex determination is regulated differently in the germline versus the soma, Sxl is also necessary and sufficient for the female identity in germ cells. Loss of Sxl function in the germline results in ovarian germline tumors, a characteristic of male germ cells developing in a female soma. Further, XY (male) germ cells expressing Sxl are able to produce eggs when transplanted into XX (female) somatic gonads, demonstrating that Sxl is also sufficient for female sexual identity in the germline. As in the soma, the presence of two X chromosomes is sufficient to activate Sxl in the germline, but the mechanism for ""counting"" X chromosomes in the germline is thought to be different from the soma. Here we have explored this mechanism at both cis- and trans-levels. Our data support the model that the Sxl ""establishment"" promoter (SxlPE) is activated in a female-specific manner in the germline, as in the soma, but that the timing of SxlPE activation, and the DNA elements that regulate SxlPE are different from those in the soma. Nevertheless, we find that the X chromosome-encoded gene sisterless A (sisA), which helps activate Sxl in the soma, is also essential for Sxl activation in the germline. Loss of sisA function leads to loss of Sxl expression in the germline, and to ovarian tumors and germline loss. These defects can be rescued by the expression of Sxl, demonstrating that sisA lies upstream of Sxl in germline sex determination. We conclude that sisA acts as an X chromosome counting element in both the soma and the germline, but that additional factors that ensure robust, female-specific expression of Sxl in the germline remain to be discovered.","NA"

We used a ""virtual lesion"" approach to characterize the ""disconnectome"" associated with periventricular white matter (PVWM) lesions. We simulated progressive ischemic PVWM lesions using sub-threshold cerebral blood flow (CBF) masks derived from a previously published group-averaged map acquired from N=436 middle aged subjects in which the lowest CBF values were seen in PVWM and morphologically recapitulated the spatial pattern of PVWM hyperintensities seen in typical aging.

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations capture UGGT in so far unobserved conformational states, giving new insights into the molecules flexibility. Principal component analysis of the MD trajectories affords a description of UGGTs overall inter-domain motions, highlighting three types of inter-domain movements: bending, twisting and clamping. These inter-domain motions modify the accessible surface area of the enzymes central saddle, likely enabling the protein to recognize and re-glucosylate substrates of different sizes and shapes, and/or re-glucosylate N-linked glycans situated at variable distances from the site of misfold. We propose to name ""Parodi limit"" the maximum distance between a site of misfolding on a UGGT glycoprotein substrate and an N-linked glycan that monomeric UGGT can re-glucosylate on the same glycoprotein. MD simulations estimate the Parodi limit to be around 60-70 [A]. Re-glucosylation assays using UGGT deletion mutants suggest that the TRXL2 domain is necessary for activity against urea-misfolded bovine thyroglobulin. Taken together, our findings support a ""one-size-fits-all adjustable spanner"" substrate recognition model, with a crucial role for the TRXL2 domain in the recruitment of misfolded substrates to the enzymes active site.","NA"

Although the former property has been studied extensively, the roles of the NSC remain unexplored. The genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) provides a unique window into ACVR1/Activin A signaling because in that disease Activin can either signal through FOPmutant ACVR1 or form NSCs with wild type ACVR1. To explore the role of the NSC, we generated  agonist-only Activin A muteins that activate ACVR1B but cannot form the NSC with ACVR1. Using one of these muteins we demonstrate that failure to form the NSC in FOP results in more severe disease pathology. These results provide the first evidence for a biological role for the NSC in vivo and pave the way for further exploration of the NSCs physiological role in corresponding knock-in mice.

BiPs essential functions in facilitating proper protein folding are mainly mediated through its dynamic interaction with unfolded or misfolded client proteins, and by serving as a negative regulator of the Unfolded Protein Response. A mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of BiP interaction with its protein partners is essential to understand ER biology, and therefore, we have sought to develop a tractable model to study misfolded protein interaction with BiP. For this purpose, we have used homologous recombination to insert a 3xFLAG epitope tag into the endogenous murine Hspa5 gene, just upstream from the essential KDEL signal necessary for ER localization of BiP. Tagging BiP in this way did not alter Hspa5 expression under basal or ER-stress induced conditions in hepatocytes ex vivo or in fibroblasts. Furthermore, the tag did not alter the cellular localization of BiP or its functionality. All of these findings in primary tissue culture were also confirmed in vivo in livers of heterozygous mice with one WT and one FLAG-tagged Hspa5 allele. Hepatocyte-specific BiP-FLAG modification did not alter liver function or UPR signaling. Importantly, immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody completely pulled down FLAG-tagged BiP from lysates of BiP-FLAG expressing livers. In summary, we generated a novel model that can be used to investigate the BiP interactome in vivo under physiological and pathophysiological conditions in a cell type-specific manner. This tool has the capability, for the first time, to provide an unbiased approach to identify unfolded and misfolded BiP-client proteins, and to provide new information on the role of BiP in many essential ER processes.","NA"

Loss of CCC1 results in severe, widespread phenotypes in both rice and Arabidopsis, including plant growth and developmental perturbations, defects in root hair elongation and altered osmoregulation, consistent with CCC performing a core cellular function. Complementation of the root hair elongation phenotype of Atccc1 with root hair specific expression of GFP-AtCCC1 demonstrates CCC1 functions within the TGN/EE.

Growing evidence indicates a role for inflammatory signaling in modifying neuronal excitability and promoting epileptogenesis. Here, we identify that signaling through an innate immune receptor, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), in neurons, augments calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR) currents in the hippocampal dentate gyrus after brain injury. Blocking TLR4 signaling in vivo shortly after brain injury reduced dentate network excitability and seizure susceptibility. When blocking of TLR4 signaling after injury was delayed, however, this treatment failed to reduce post-injury seizure susceptibility. Further, TLR4 signal blocking was less efficacious in limiting seizure susceptibility when AMPAR currents, downstream targets of TLR4 signaling, were transiently enhanced. Paradoxically, blocking TLR4 signaling augmented both network excitability and seizure susceptibility in uninjured controls. Despite the differential effect on seizure susceptibility, TLR4 antagonism suppressed cellular inflammatory responses after injury without impacting sham controls. These findings demonstrate that independently of glia, the immune receptor TLR4 directly regulates post-traumatic neuronal excitability. Moreover, the TLR4-dependent early increase in dentate excitability is causally associated with epileptogenesis. Identification and selective targeting of the mechanisms underlying the aberrant TLR4-mediated increase in CP-AMPAR signaling after injury may prevent epileptogenesis after traumatic brain injury.

The schematic neurons include TLR4 and AMPAR subunit expression profiles in the acute phase of sham or brain injury. The corresponding early effects on network excitability are depicted by schematic population response traces (inset on upper left). Note the increase in excitability of the uninjured neuron after TLR4 antagonism without changes in AMPAR expression. Note also the increase in TLR4, calcium permeable AMPARs and population excitability after injury and its reduction by TLR4 antagonist treatment. Ampakine enhancement of excitability during TLR4 antagonism is illustrated. The early phase responses and manipulations (including injury, treatments, and molecular responses) are superimposed on a two-tone color-coded network state topology where green indicates low-normal network excitability, ensuring network stability and low risk for epilepsy (Inset on upper right).

However, some marine mammal populations (e.g. pinnipeds) have largely recovered from exploitation, and interactions between these species and fisheries--particularly small-scale fisheries--is once again of concern globally. The large scope and widespread scale of interactions highlights the local disconnect between two global policies: marine mammal conservation and small-scale fisheries protection. In this research, we explore these conflicting global policies by assessing the perceptions of coastal small-scale fishers in Peru and Chile regarding their interactions with pinnipeds, including the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) and South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis). We surveyed 301 gill net fishers and assess perceptions using a best-worst scaling methodology. We find that fishers are chiefly concerned with the increase in pinniped populations, perceive that their interactions with pinnipeds have significantly increased over the past 80 years, and report pinniped-driven catch and income losses [&ge;] 26 per cent. Surprisingly, fishers do not believe that compensation schemes will resolve this issue--instead they overwhelmingly call for pinniped population culls. The reported number of pinnipeds illegally killed by fishers suggests the potential for large negative impacts on these protected species, and a loss of legitimacy in marine regulation. Collectively, our results portray a sense of marginalisation from fishers--that global policy treats them as less ""important"" than marine mammals. Our results highlight the increasing disconnect in global policy, which on one hand seeks to protect threatened marine mammal populations, and on the other seeks to promote the welfare of small-scale fishers.","NA"

Cancer cells undergoing EMT exhibit enhanced aggressive behavior characterized by drug resistance, tumor-initiation potential, and the ability to evade immune system. Recent in silico, in vitro, and in vivo evidence indicates that EMT is not an all-or-none process; instead, cells stably acquire one or more hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotypes which often can be more aggressive than purely epithelial or mesenchymal cell populations. Thus, the EMT status of cancer cells can prove to be a critical estimate of patient prognosis. Recent attempts have employed different transcriptomics signatures to quantify EMT status in cell lines and patient tumors. However, a comprehensive comparison of these methods, including their accuracy in identifying cells in the hybrid E/M phenotype(s), is lacking. Here, we compare three distinct metrics that score EMT on a continuum, based on the transcriptomics signature of individual samples. Our results demonstrate that these methods exhibit good concordance among themselves in quantifying the extent of EMT in a given sample. Moreover, scoring EMT using any of the three methods discerned that cells undergo varying extents of EMT across tumor types. Separately, our analysis also identified tumor types with maximum variability in terms of EMT and associated an enrichment of hybrid E/M signatures in these samples. Moreover, we also found that the multinomial logistic regression (MLR) based metric was capable of distinguishing between  pure individual hybrid E/M vs. mixtures of epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) cells. Our results, thus, suggest that while any of the three methods can indicate a generic trend in the EMT status of a given cell, the MLR method has two additional advantages: a) it uses a small number of predictors to calculate the EMT score, and b) it can predict from the transcriptomic signature of a population whether it is comprised of  pure hybrid E/M cells at the single-cell level or is instead an ensemble of E and M cell subpopulations.","10.3389/fbioe.2020.00220"

MethodsC. difficile carriage was determined by positive toxin-B PCR from rectal swabs of asymptomatc patients. Active CDI was defined as a positive 2-step EIA/PCR test in patients with >3 unformed stools/24 hours. C. difficile environmental contamination was assessed by obtaining specimens from 10 sites in the patients rooms. Toxigenic strains were identified by PCR. We created a contamination scale to define the overall level of room contamination that ranged from clean to heavy contamination.

Results117 rooms were screened; 70 rooms inhabited by C. difficile carriers, 30 rooms by active CDI patients and 17 rooms by non C. difficile -carriers (Control). In the carrier rooms 29 (41%) had more than residual contamination, from which 17 (24%) were heavily contaminated. In the CDI rooms 12 (40%) had more than residual contamination from which 3 (10%) were heavily contaminated, while in the control rooms, one room (6%) had more than residual contamination and none were heavily contaminated.

Insulin sensitization with pioglitazone mitigated pyruvate-driven TCA cycle activity and PDH activation via both covalent (PDK4 and PDP2) and allosteric (intracellular pyruvate availability) mechanisms. Interestingly, improvements in insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function were entirely dissociated from changes in hepatic triglycerides, diacylglycerides or fatty acids. Instead, we show that the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin undergoes pathological remodeling in livers from obese mice and that this is reversed by insulin sensitization. Our findings identify targetable mitochondrial features of T2D and NAFLD and highlight the benefit of insulin sensitization in managing the clinical burden of obesity-associated disease.","NA"

Recent works on lineage reconstruction based on the single-cell expression data are suitable for short time frames while tracing lineage based on more stable genetic markers is needed for studies that span time scales over months or years. However, variant calling from the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data suffers from ""genetic drop-outs"", including low coverage and allelic bias, which presents significant obstacles for lineage reconstruction. Prior studies focused only on mitochondrial (chrM) variants and need to be expanded to the whole genome to capture more variants with clearer physiological meaning. However, non-chrM variants suffer even more severe drop-outs than chrM variants, although drop-outs affect all variants. We developed strategies to overcome genetic drop-outs in scRNA-Seq-derived whole genomic variants for accurate lineage tracing, and we developed SClineger, a Bayesian Hierarchical model, to implement our approach. Our validation analyses on a series of sequencing protocols demonstrated the necessity of correction for genetic drop-outs and consideration of variants in the whole genome, and also showed the improvement that our approach provided. We showed that genetic-based lineage tracing is applicable for single-cell studies of both tumors and non-tumor tissues using our approach, and can reveal novel biological insights not afforded by expressional analyses. Interestingly, we showed that cells of various lineages grew under the spatial constraints of their respective organs during the developmental process. Overall, our work provides a powerful tool that can be applied to the large amounts of already existing scRNA-Seq data to construct the lineage histories of cells and derive new knowledge.","NA"

However, the molecular mechanism of TP53 stabilization by HPV16 E7 has remained obscure and can occur independent of E2F regulated MDM2 inhibitor, p14ARF. Here, we report that the Damage Induced Noncoding (DINO) lncRNA (DINOL) is the missing link between HPV16 E7 and increased TP53 levels. DINO levels are decreased in cells where TP53 is inactivated, either by HPV16 E6, expression of a dominant negative TP53 minigene or by TP53 depletion. DINO levels are increased in HPV16 E7 expressing cells. HPV16 E7 causes increased DINO expression independent of RB1 degradation and E2F1 activation. Similar to the adjacent CDKN1A locus, DINO expression is regulated by the histone demethylase, KDM6A. DINO stabilizes TP53 in HPV16 E7 expressing cells and as a TP53 transcriptional target, DINO levels further increase. Similar to other oncogenes such as adenovirus E1A or MYC, HPV16 E7 expressing cells are sensitized to cell death under conditions of metabolic stress and in the case of E7, this has been linked to TP53 activation. Consistent with earlier studies, we show that HPV16 E7 expressing keratinocytes are highly sensitive to metabolic stress induced by the antidiabetic drug, metformin. Metformin sensitivity of HPV16 E7 expressing cells is rescued by DINO depletion. This work identifies DINO as a critical mediator TP53 stabilization and activation in HPV16 E7 expressing cells.

IMPORTANCEViral oncoproteins, including HPV16 E6 and E7 have been instrumental in elucidating the activities of cellular signaling networks including those governed by the TP53 tumor suppressor. Our study demonstrates that the long noncoding RNA DINO is the long sought missing link between HPV16 E7 and elevated TP53 levels. Importantly, the TP53 stabilizing DINO plays a critical role in the predisposition of HPV16 E7 expressing cells to cell death under metabolic stress conditions from metformin treatment.","10.1128/JVI.02178-19"

In mice, this mutation was sufficient to alter polyadenylation sites in over 1,000 genes critical for brain development. Using a reporter gene assay, we demonstrated that C/P efficiency of CSTF2D50A was lower than wild type.

Consequently, inhibitory components and microenvironment for remyelination might serve as potential therapeutic targets for treating white matter injury after acute central nervous system injury and neurodegeneration diseases. Lipocalin-2 was recently reported to corelate with white matter in both atypical, acute white matter injured disease subarachnoid hemorrhage and typical, chronic white matter injured disease multiple sclerosis. To elucidate the role and underlying mechanism of Lipocalin-2 in oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and remyelination, we used genetic inhibition and a constitutive conditional knockout model with subarachnoid hemorrhage or multiple sclerosis. We found that the genetic inhibition of the increase in Lipocalin-2 promoted oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation, remyelination, and functional recovery after subarachnoid hemorrhage or multiple sclerosis. Unexpectedly, the inhibition of Lipocalin-2 did not reduce glial activation and inflammation. Lipocalin-2 was shown to activate Early Growth Response Protein 1 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which is partly regulated by its receptor SLC22A17. In the conditional knockout of Early Growth Response Protein 1 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, we discovered enhanced oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation in developing and injured white matter; consistently, the specific inactivation of Early Growth Response Protein 1 promoted remyelination and neurological recovery after subarachnoid hemorrhage or multiple sclerosis. Thus, we propose that following white matter injury in humans, the increase in Lipocalin-2 activates Early Growth Response Protein 1 and consequently impair oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and myelin repair. Our results suggest that therapies specifically inactivating Lipocalin-2/ Early Growth Response Protein 1 signal in oligodendroglial lineage cells could represent a novel strategy to enhance differentiation and remyelination in white matter injury patients.","NA"

Resistance to immunotherapy can be attributed in part to tissue-specific factors constraining antitumor immunity. Thus, a better understanding of how the colon microenvironment shapes the immune response to CRC is needed to identify mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapies and guide the development of novel therapeutics.

MethodsIn an orthotopic mouse model of MC38-CRC, tumor progression was monitored by bioluminescence imaging and the immune signatures were assessed at a transcriptional level using NanoString and at a cellular level by flow cytometry.

ResultsDespite initial tumor growth in all mice, only 25 to 35% of mice developed a progressive lethal CRC while the remaining animals spontaneously rejected their solid tumor. No tumor rejection was observed in the absence of adaptive immunity, nor when MC38 cells were injected in non-orthotopic locations, subcutaneously or into the liver. We observed that progressive CRC tumors exhibited a protumor immune response, characterized by a regulatory T-lymphocyte pattern, discernible shortly post-tumor implantation, as well as suppressive myeloid cells. In contrast, tumor-rejecting mice presented an early inflammatory response and an antitumor microenvironment enriched in CD8+ T cells.

ConclusionsTaken together, our data demonstrate the role of the colon microenvironment in regulating the balance between anti or protumor immune responses. While emphasizing the relevance of the CRC orthotopic model, they set the basis for exploring the impact of the identified signatures in colon cancer response to immunotherapy.","NA"

They have a high rearrangement but low mutation rate, and a large size. Based on massive mitochondrial DNA transfers to the nucleus as well as the mitochondrial unique evolutionary traits, we propose a ""Mitochondrial Fostering"" theory where the organelle genome plays an integral role in the arrival and development of orphan genes (genes with no homologues in other lineages). Two approaches were used to test this theory: 1) bioinformatic analysis of nuclear mitochondrial DNA (Numts: mitochondrial originating DNA that has migrated to the nucleus) at the genome level, and 2) bioinformatic analysis of particular orphan sequences present in both the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. One study example is given about one orphan sequence that codes for two unique orphan genes: one in the mitochondrial genome and another one in the nuclear genome. DNA alignments show regions of this A. thaliana orphan sequence exist scattered throughout other land plant mitochondrial genomes. This is consistent with the high recombination rates of mitochondrial genomes in land plants. This may also enable the creation of novel coding sequences within the orphan loci, which can then be transferred to the nuclear genome and become exposed to new evolutionary pressures. Our study also reveals a high correlation between mitochondrial DNA rate transferred to the nuclear genome and number of orphan genes in land plants. All the data suggests the mitochondrial genome may play a role in nuclear orphan gene evolution in land plants.","NA"

Specifically, we provide evidence that IL-22 promotes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis and regulates the metabolic reprogramming related transcriptional responses. IL-22 controls metabolic regulators and enzymes activity through the induction of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), thereby ameliorating mitochondrial. The upstream effector lncRNA H19 also participates in the controlling of these metabolic processes in hepatocytes. Importantly, amelioration of liver injury by IL-22 through activation of metabolism relevant signaling and regulation of mitochondrial function are further demonstrated in cisplatin-induced liver injury and steatohepatitis. Collectively, our results reveal a novel mechanism underscoring the regulation of metabolic profiles of hepatocytes by IL-22 during liver injury, which might provide useful insights from the bench to the clinic in treating and preventing liver diseases.

We also formulated a concave hull boundary displacement method (i.e., CEB) and an area-based regression method (i.e., AER) for estimating spread with geopolitical-unit data. Three regions with different sized counties in the United States (U.S.) were selected to conduct simulations and three spread scenarios were simulated. R2 and root mean square error were used to evaluate the abilities of all methods to estimate spread. Correlation coefficients were used to assess the similarity pattern of all methods. Finally, kudzu bug Megacopta cribraria, an invasive insect in the U.S., was used as a case study to test the generality of some results concluded from the simulated research. We found the CEB and two regression methods consistently estimated the right expansion patterns. Two boundary displacement and two area-based regression methods estimated highly correlated spread and were the best four methods, among which CEB had the best estimation. Distance-based regression methods are sensitive to irregularity and stochasticity in spread, and the minimum spread distance method had low ability to estimate spread. The case study showed consistent results with the simulated research. Both regression and boundary displacement methods can estimate spread patterns, overall rate, and spread dynamics of invasive species. Boundary displacement methods best estimate spread rates and dynamics; however, for spread without clear infestation outlines, area-based regression methods can be good alternatives.","NA"

We recently cloned Yr15 as a Wheat Tandem Kinase 1 (WTK1) and showed here that these three resistance loci co-segregate in fine-mapping populations and share identical full-length genomic sequence of functional Wtk1. Independent EMS mutagenized susceptible yrG303 and yrH52 lines carried single nucleotide mutations in Wtk1 that disrupted function.

Introgression of Wtk1 into multiple genetic backgrounds resulted in variable phenotypic responses, confirming that Wtk1-mediated resistance is part of a complex immune response network.

To improve our ability to develop location-specific risk management practices, a study was conducted in two produce-growing regions to (i) characterize the relationship between E. coli levels and pathogen presence in agricultural water, and (ii) identify environmental factors associated with pathogen detection. Three AZ and six NY waterways were sampled longitudinally using 10-L grab samples (GS) and 24-h Moore swabs (MS). Regression showed that the likelihood of Salmonella detection (Odds Ratio [OR]=2.18), and eaeA-stx codetection (OR=6.49) was significantly greater for MS compared to GS, while the likelihood of detecting L. monocytogenes was not. Regression also showed that eaeA-stx codetection in AZ (OR=50.2) and NY (OR=18.4), and Salmonella detection in AZ (OR=4.4) were significantly associated with E. coli levels, while Salmonella detection in NY was not. Random forest analysis indicated that interactions between environmental factors (e.g., rainfall, temperature, turbidity) (i) were associated with likelihood of pathogen detection and (ii) mediated the relationship between E. coli levels and likelihood of pathogen detection. Our findings suggest that (i) environmental heterogeneity, including interactions between factors, affects microbial water quality, and (ii) E. coli levels alone may not be a suitable indicator of the food safety risks. Instead, targeted methods that utilize environmental and microbial data (e.g., models that use turbidity and E. coli levels to predict when there is a high or low risk of surface water being contaminated by pathogens) are needed to assess and mitigate the food safety risks associated with preharvest water use. By identifying environmental factors associated with an increased likelihood of detecting pathogens in agricultural water, this study provides information that (i) can be used to assess when pathogen contamination of agricultural water is likely to occur, and (ii) facilitate development of targeted interventions for individual water sources, providing an alternative to existing one-size-fits-all approaches.","10.3389/fmicb.2020.00134"

As 2-photon microscopes are becoming increasingly affordable, the bottleneck is no longer the hardware, but the software used to analyze the calcium data in an optimal manner and consistently across different groups. We addressed this unmet need by incorporating recent software solutions for motion correction, segmentation, signal extraction and deconvolution of calcium imaging data into an open-source, easy to use, GUI-based, intuitive and automated data analysis software, which we named EZcalcium.","NA"

M.","Edward Moreira Bahnson","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","2020-01-02",1,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","pathology","AimsAssessment of preclinical models of vascular disease are paramount in the successful translation of novel treatments. The results of these models have traditionally relied on 2-D histological methodologies. Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is an imaging platform that allows for 3-D visualization of whole organs and tissues. In this study, we describe an improved methodological approach utilizing LSFM for imaging of preclinical vascular injury models while minimizing analysis bias.

Methods and ResultsThe rat carotid artery segmental pressure-controlled balloon injury and mouse carotid artery ligation injury were performed. Arteries were harvested and processed for LSFM imaging and 3-D analysis, as well as for 2-D area histological analysis. Artery processing for LSFM imaging did not induce vessel shrinkage or expansion, and was reversible by rehydrating the artery, allowing for subsequent sectioning and histological staining a posteriori. By generating a volumetric visualization along the length of the arteries, LSFM imaging provided different analysis modalities including volumetric, area, and radial parameters. Thus, LSFM-imaged arteries provided more precise measurements compared to classic histological analysis. Furthermore, LSFM provided additional information as compared to 2-D analysis in demonstrating remodeling of the arterial media in regions of hyperplasia and periadventitial neovascularization around the ligated mouse artery.

ConclusionsLSFM provides a novel and robust 3-D imaging platform for visualizing and quantifying arterial injury in preclinical models. When compared with classic histology, LSFM outperformed traditional methods in precision and quantitative capabilities. LSFM allows for more comprehensive quantitation as compared to traditional histological methodologies, while minimizing user bias associated with area analysis of alternating, 2-D histological artery cross-sections.

Translational PerspectiveA more reproducible and robust quantitation of vascular pathology in preclinical models is necessary to accelerate translational discovery. Current methodology to assess vascular disease has significant limitations. The methodology described herein employs a modern imaging modality, light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), to improve assessment of established preclinical vascular injury models. LSFM provides more comprehensive and precise analysis capabilities than classical histological approaches. Hence, LSFM applied to vascular research has the potential to drive new basic discoveries, and ultimately translation of novel therapies.","10.1093/cvr/cvaa037"

The magnitude of 64Cu-DOTA-vMIP-II accumulation correlated with monocyte recruitment, as Apoe-/- mice treated with AAV-mApoE showed PET signal declining as monocyte recruitment subsided. Unexpectedly, monocytes themselves were not the major target of the 64Cu-DOTA-vMIP-II tracer. Using fluorescence-tagged vMIP-II tracer, competitive receptor blocking with CXCR4 antagonists, CXCR4-specific tracer 64Cu-DOTA-FC131, or CXCR4 staining during disease progression and regression, endothelial cell expression of CXCR4 proved to be the main target of 64Cu-DOTA-vMIP-II imaging. Expression of CXCR4 was low in non-plaque areas, but strongly detected on endothelium at the edges of progressing plaques, corresponding to a population of proliferating endothelium and to the location in plaques where monocyte recruitment occurred. Thus, endothelial injury status of plaques is marked by CXCR4 expression and that this injury correlates with the tendency of such plaques to recruit monocytes. Furthermore, our findings suggest PET tracers that, through binding CXCR4, may be useful to monitor plaque injury status.","NA"

Innes","Indiana University","2020-01-02",1,"cc_by_nd","new results","plant biology","Stress signaling in plants is carefully regulated to ensure proper development and reproductive fitness. Overactive defense signaling can result in dwarfism as well as developmental defects. In addition to requiring a significant amount of energy, plant stress responses place a burden upon the cellular machinery, which can result in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Negative regulators of stress signaling, such as EDR1, ensure that stress responses are properly suspended when they are not needed. Here, we describe the role of an uncharacterized N-terminal acetyltransferase, NAA50, in the regulation of plant development and stress responses. Our results demonstrate that NAA50, an interactor of EDR1, plays an important role in regulating the tradeoff between plant growth and defense. Plants lacking NAA50 display severe developmental defects as well as induced stress responses. Reduction of NAA50 expression results in arrested stem and root growth and senescence. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that EDR1 and NAA50 are required for suppression of ER stress signaling. This work establishes that NAA50 is essential for plant development and the suppression of stress responses, likely through the regulation of ER stress. These experiments demonstrate a role for N-terminal acetylation in the suppression of ER stress, as well as the tradeoff between stress responses and development.

Two draft genome assemblies based on short-read sequencing were released in 2013 for this species. Although valuable, these resources contain pervasive assembly errors and are highly fragmented, two features limiting their values. Our purpose here was to improve the assembly of the D. suzukii genome. For this, we generated PacBio long-read sequencing data at 160X sequence coverage and assembled a novel, contiguous D. suzukii genome. We obtained a high-quality assembly of 270 Mb (with 546 contigs, a N50 of 2.6Mb, a L50 of 15, and a BUSCO score of 95%) that we called WT3-2.0. We found that despite 16 rounds of full-sib crossings the D. suzukii strain that we sequenced has maintained high levels of polymorphism in some regions of its genome (ca. 19Mb). As a consequence, the quality of the assembly of these regions was reduced. We explored possible origins of this high residual diversity, including the presence of structural variants and a possible heterogeneous admixture pattern of North American and Asian ancestry. Overall, our WT3-2.0 assembly provides a higher quality genomic resource compared to the previous one in terms of general assembly statistics, sequence quality and gene annotation. This new D. suzukii genome assembly is therefore an improved resource for high-throughput sequencing approaches, as well as manipulative genetic technologies to study D. suzukii.","NA"

Surprisingly, we find that the inputs from insular cortex form excitatory connections with similar strength to all types of CeA neurons. To reconcile this puzzling result, and previous findings, we developed a conductance-based dynamical systems model for the CeA neuronal network. Computer simulations showed that both the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of individual CeA neurons and the overall synaptic organization of the CeA circuit play a functionally significant role in shaping the CeA neural dynamics.

However, the ChIP-Seq protocol for low-input samples is laborious, time-consuming and suffers from experimental variation, resulting in poor reproducibility and low throughput. Although prototypic microfluidic ChIP-Seq platforms have been developed, these are poorly transferable as they require sophisticated custom-made equipment and in-depth microfluidic and ChIP expertise, while lacking parallelisation. To enable standardized, automated ChIP-Seq profiling of low-input samples, we constructed PDMS-based plates containing microfluidic Integrated Fluidic Circuits capable of performing 24 sensitive ChIP reactions within 30 minutes hands-on time. These disposable plates can conveniently be loaded into a widely available controller for pneumatics and thermocycling, making the ChIP-Seq procedure Plug and Play (PnP). We demonstrate high-quality ChIP-seq on hundreds to few thousands of cells for multiple widely-profiled post-translational histone modifications, together allowing genome-wide identification of regulatory elements. As proof of principle, we managed to generate high-quality epigenetic profiles of rare totipotent subpopulations of mESCs using our platform. In light of the ready-to-go ChIP plates and the automated workflow, we named our procedure PnP-ChIP-Seq. PnP-ChIP-Seq allows non-expert labs worldwide to conveniently run robust, standardized ChIP-Seq, while its high-throughput, consistency and sensitivity paves the way towards large-scale profiling of precious sample types such as rare subpopulations of cells or biopsies.

With respect to skeletal traits, little is known about the gene regulation underlying these hard tissues or how tissue-specific patterns are associated with bone morphology or vary among species. To begin exploring these topics, this study evaluates one epigenetic mechanism, DNA methylation, in skeletal tissues from five nonhuman primate species which display anatomical and locomotor differences representative of their phylogenetic groups.

Materials and MethodsFirst, we test whether intra-specific variation in skeletal DNA methylation is associated with intra-specific variation in femur morphology. Second, we identify inter-specific differences in DNA methylation and assess whether these lineage-specific patterns may have contributed to species-specific morphologies. Specifically, we use the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip to identify DNA methylation patterns in femur trabecular bone from baboons (n=28), macaques (n=10), vervets (n=10), chimpanzees (n=4), and marmosets (n=6).

ResultsSignificant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were associated with a subset of morphological variants, but these likely have small biological effects and may be confounded by other variables associated with morphological variation. Conversely, several species-specific DMPs were identified, and these are found in genes enriched for functions associated with complex skeletal traits.

DiscussionOverall, these findings reveal that while intra-specific epigenetic variation is not readily associated with skeletal morphology differences, some inter-specific epigenetic differences in skeletal tissues exist and may contribute to evolutionarily distinct phenotypes. This work forms a foundation for future explorations of gene regulation and skeletal trait evolution in primates.","NA"

High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms provide a powerful means to collect high-dimensional phenotypes throughout the growing season for large populations. However, to date, selection of an appropriate statistical genomic framework to integrate multiple temporal traits for genomic prediction in plants remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a multi-trait RRM (MT-RRM) for genomic prediction of daily water usage (WU) in rice (Oryza sativa) through joint modeling with shoot biomass (projected shoot area, PSA). Three hundred and fifty-seven accessions were phenotyped daily for WU and PSA over 20 days using a greenhouse-based HTP platform. MT-RRMs that modeled additive genetic and permanent environmental effects for both traits using quadratic Legendre polynomials were used to assess genomic correlations between traits and genomic prediction for WU. Predictive abilities of the MT-RRMs were assessed using two cross-validation (CV) scenarios. The first scenario was designed to predict genetic values for WU at all time points for a set of accessions with unobserved WU. The second scenario was designed to forecast future genetic values for WU for a panel of known accessions with records for WU at earlier time periods. In each scenario we evaluated two MT-RRMs in which PSA records were absent or available for time points in the testing population. Moderate to strong genomic correlations between WU and PSA were observed across the days of imaging (0.29-0.87). In both CV scenarios, MT-RRMs showed better predictive abilities compared to single-trait RRM, and prediction accuracies were greatly improved when PSA records were available for the testing population. In summary, these frameworks provide an effective approach to predict temporal physiological traits that are difficult or expensive to quantify in large populations.","10.1371/journal.pone.0228118"

Using this scoring system, we here report that: (1) DenseNet-169, CORnet-S and ResNet-101 are the most brain-like ANNs. (2) There remains considerable variability in neural and behavioral responses that is not predicted by any ANN, suggesting that no ANN model has yet captured all the relevant mechanisms.

In most animals, this resulted in lasting reductions in mechanical sensitivity thresholds, and in lasting increases in facial grimace scores. We recorded electrocortigraphy (ECoG) signals over the neocortex of these rats, before and after CCI-ION, and analyzed these signals with a novel, spectral modelling approach. Consistent with our hypothesis, power in the 6-9 Hz bandwidth of the ECoG was differentially modulated in animals displaying signs of chronic pain.

Furthermore, we show that changes in the power of this oscillation after injury, obtained at the individual animal level, provide a more sensitive marker of pain presence than do traditional between animal comparisons of post-injury oscillatory power. Identification of animals demonstrating chronic-pain behaviors was more accurate when estimates of post-injury oscillatory power were compared against each animals own pre-injury baseline than when compared against post-injury power estimates from animals not developing chronic pain.

We examined visuospatial attention, the mental representation of space, and spatially-defined motor function in 54 people with unilateral upper-limb CRPS and 22 pain-free controls. Contrary to our hypotheses and previous evidence, individuals with CRPS did not show any systematic spatial biases in visuospatial attention to or representation of the side of space corresponding to their affected limb (relative to the unaffected side). We found very little evidence of directional slowing of movements towards the affected relative to unaffected side that would be consistent with motor neglect. People with CRPS were, however, slower than controls to initiate and execute movements with both their affected and unaffected hands, which suggests disrupted central motor networks. Finally, we found no evidence of any clinical relevance of changes in spatial cognition because there were no relationships between the magnitude of spatial biases and the severity of pain or other CRPS symptoms. The results did reveal potential relationships between CRPS pain and symptom severity, subjective body perception disturbance, and extent of motor impairment, which would support treatments focused on normalizing body representation and improving motor function.

Here, we used comprehensive transcriptomic analyses of F.vesca and F. x ananassa to investigate gene expression at different stages of fruit development. In total, we obtained a total of 3,187 (turning stage) and 3,061 (red stage) differentially expressed genes with the pairwise comparisons between diploid and octoploid. Genes involved in flavonoids and phenlypropanoids biosynthesis, were almost up-regulated in the both turning and red stages of octoploid, and we also discovery a ripe-fruit specific module associated with several flavonoids biosynthesis genes, including FveMYB10, FveMYB9/11, and FveRAP by using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Furthermore, we identified the species-specific regulated network in the octoploid and diploid fruit. Notably, we found that the WAK and F-box genes were enriched in the octoploid and diploid fruits, respectively. As a whole, this study contributes to shed new light on the flavonoid biosynthetic and fruit size of strawberry, with important implications for future molecular breeding in the cultivated strawberry.","NA"

Wrinkle structures of veins are found on the bending zones of the hind wings of H. axyridis. This paper investigates the effect of the wrinkle structures of the veins of the hind wing on its deformation. Based on the nanomechanical properties of the veins, morphology of the hind wing, surface structures of veins and microstructures of the cross sections, including the veins and wing membranes, we establish four three-dimensional coupling models for hind wings with/without wrinkles with different and uniform reduced modulus. Relative to the bending and twisting model shapes, Model I, which includes the wrinkle structure and different reduced-modulus veins, has much more flexibility of passive deformation to control wing deformations. The results show that both the wrinkle structures in the bending zone and varying reduced modulus of the veins contribute to the flight performance of bending and twisting deformations of the hind wings, which have important implications for the bionic design of the biomimetic deployable wing of micro air vehicles (MAVs).","NA"

Disruption of the intestinal microbiota and immune responses contribute to host susceptibility and severity of C. difficile infection. However, the impact of aging on the cellular immune response associated with C. difficile infection in the setting of advanced age remains to be well described. This study explores the effect of age on cellular immune responses in C. difficile infection as well as disease severity. Young adult mice (2-3 months old) and aged mice (22-28 months old) were rendered susceptible to C. difficile infection with cefoperazone and then infected with C. difficile strains of varying disease-causing potential. Aged mice infected with C. difficile develop more severe clinical disease, compared to young mice. Tissue-specific CD45+ immune cell responses occurred at the time of peak disease severity in the cecum and colon of all mice infected with a high-virulence strain of C. difficile; however, significant deficits in intestinal neutrophils and eosinophils were detected in aged mice. Interestingly, while C. difficile infection in young mice was associated with a robust increase in cecal and colonic eosinophils, there was a complete lack of an intestinal eosinophil response in aged counterparts accompanied by a simultaneous increase in blood eosinophils with severe disease. These findings demonstrate that age-related alterations in immune responses are associated with significantly worse C. difficile infection and support a key role for intestinal eosinophils in mitigating C. difficile-mediated disease severity.","NA"

Despite the enormous disease burden associated with NTHi infections, there are currently no effective prevention strategies, and the rapid development of antibiotic resistance is compromising treatment.

We previously discovered Haemophilus haemolyticus (Hh) strains capable of producing haemophilin (HPL), a heme-binding protein that restricts NTHi growth by limiting its access to an essential growth factor, heme. Thus, these strains may have utility as a probiotic therapy against NTHi infection by limiting colonization, migration and subsequent infection in susceptible individuals. Here, we have assessed the feasibility of this approach by in vitro competition assays between NTHi and Hh strains with varying capacity to produce HPL. HPL-producing strains of Hh exhibited enhanced growth and consistently outcompeted NTHi compared to Hh strains unable to produce the protein. This competitive advantage was maintained over a period of six days, culminating in the complete eradication of NTHi. Expression analysis of HPL during competition coincided with the NTHi-inhibitory capacity of HPL-producers, confirming that inhibition was mediated by the presence of HPL.

Together, results suggest that natural levels of HPL production by Hh are sufficient to limit NTHis access to heme, even under excess heme conditions unlikely to be encountered in vivo. Further investigation is required to determine the protective capacity of HPL-producers in vivo and their ability to interrupt NTHi colonization of host cells.","NA"

Previous studies have identified the presence of non-coding RNAs in the major zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, however, few have been functionally characterized to date. CjNC110 is a conserved ncRNA in C. jejuni, located downstream of the luxS gene which is responsible for the production of the quorum-sensing molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2). In this study, we utilized strand specific high-throughput RNAseq to identify potential targets or interactive partners of CjNC110 in a sheep abortion clone of C. jejuni. This data was then utilized to focus further phenotypic evaluation of the role of CjNC110 in motility, autoagglutination, quorum sensing, hydrogen peroxide sensitivity and chicken colonization in C. jejuni. Inactivation of the CjNC110 ncRNA led to a statistically significant decrease in autoagglutination ability as well as increased motility and hydrogen peroxide sensitivity when compared to wild-type. Extracellular AI-2 detection was decreased in {triangleup}CjNC110, however, intracellular AI-2 accumulation was significantly increased, suggesting a key role of CjNC110 in modulating the transport of AI-2. Notably, {triangleup}CjNC110 also showed a decreased ability to colonize chickens. Complementation of CjNC110 restored all phenotypic changes back to wild-type levels. The collective results of the phenotypic and transcriptomic changes observed in our data provide valuable insights into the pathobiology of C. jejuni sheep abortion clone and strongly suggest that CjNC110 plays an important role in regulation of energy taxis, flagellar glycosylation, cellular communication via quorum sensing, oxidative stress tolerance and chicken colonization in this important zoonotic pathogen.","NA"

Here we set out a novel approach for inferring viral transmission bottlenecks; our method combines haplotype reconstruction, a method for inferring the composition of genomes in a viral population, with two maximum likelihood methods for bottleneck inference, tailored for small and large bottleneck sizes respectively. Our method allows for rapid calculation, and performs well when applied to data from simulated transmission events, being robust to errors in the haplotype reconstruction process. Applied to data from a previous household transmission study of influenza A infection we confirm the result that the majority of transmission events involve a small number of viruses, albeit with slightly looser bottlenecks being inferred, with between 1 and 13 particles transmitted in the majority of cases. While influenza A transmission involves a tight population bottleneck, the bottleneck is not so tight as to universally prevent the transmission of within-host viral diversity.","10.1128/JVI.00014-20"

Rodrigues","Yale University","2020-01-03",1,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","evolutionary biology","Natural selection favours individuals who maximise their own reproductive success and that of their close relatives. From this perspective, cooperation that benefits individuals of a different species represents an evolutionary conundrum. The theory of mutualism seeks to resolve this puzzle, and it posits that there must be downstream benefits to cooperators that offset any costs inherently associated with interspecific cooperation. Thus, individuals should only further the survival and fecundity of their interspecific partners if this generates additional return benefits, such as food, shelter or protection. A major challenge for the evolution of mutualism is when the ecological niches of partner species overlap, as this creates a tension between the benefits of exchanging services and the costs of competing for shared resources. Here we study the extent to which niche expansion, in which cooperation augments the common pool of resources, can resolve this problem. We find that niche expansion facilitates the evolution of mutualism, especially when populations are at high densities. Further, we show that niche expansion can promote the evolution of reproductive restraint, in which a focal species adaptively sacrifices its own growth rate to increase the density of partner species. We interpret these results in the context of microbial community interactions, which are often characterized by yield-enhancing exchanges of nutrients, termed  cross-feeding. Our findings suggest that yield-enhancing mutualisms are more prevalent in stable habitats with a constant supply of resources, where populations typically live at high densities, but such mutualisms are particularly vulnerable to the emergence of cheats. In general, our findings highlight the need to integrate both temporal and spatial dynamics in the analysis of mutualisms.","NA"

Author SummaryDNA is now considered to be a promising candidate media for future digital information storage in order to tackle the global issue of data explosion. Transcoding between binary digital data and quanternary DNA information is one of the most important steps in the whole process of DNA digital storage. Although several coding schemes have been reported, researchers are still investigating better strategies. Moreover, the scripts of these coding schemes use different programming languages, software architectures and optimization contents. Therefore, we here introduce Chamaeleo, a library in which several classical coding schemes are collected, to reconstruct and optimize them. One of the key features of this tool is that we modulize the functions and make it feasible for more customized way of usage. Meanwhile, developers can also incorporate their new algorithms according to the framework expediently. Based on the benchmark tests we conducted, Chamaeleo shows better flexibility and expandability compared to original packages and we hope that it will help the further study and applications in DNA digital storage.","NA"

Parasite load in the samples was quantified using microscopic examination. Group size was significantly higher in Pre-Monsoon season as compared to Monsoon and Post-Monsoon seasons. While, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons had higher parasite prevalence and load as compared to pre-monsoon season.

Pervasive transcription poses a risk that needs to be controlled to prevent the perturbation of gene expression. In yeast, the highly conserved helicase Sen1 restricts pervasive transcription by inducing termination of non-coding transcription. However, the mechanisms underlying the specific function of Sen1 at ncRNAs are poorly understood. Here we identify a motif in an intrinsically disordered region of Sen1 that mimics the phosphorylated carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II and characterize structurally its recognition by the CTD-interacting domain of Nrd1, an RNA-binding protein that binds specific sequences in ncRNAs. In addition, we show that Sen1-dependent termination strictly requires the recognition of the CTD by the N-terminal domain of Sen1. We provide evidence that the Sen1-CTD interaction does not promote Sen1 initial recruitment but rather the capacity of Sen1 to induce the release of paused RNAPII from the DNA.

We first applied stratified LD score regression to assess the informativeness of annotations defined by top variants from published Mendelian disease pathogenicity scores across 41 independent common diseases and complex traits (average N = 320K). Several of the resulting annotations were informative for common disease, even after conditioning on a broad set of coding, conserved, regulatory and LD-related annotations from the baseline-LD model.

Previous studies reveal that P. putida S12 contains a single-copy 583 kbp megaplasmid pTTS12. This pTTS12 encodes several important operons and gene clusters facilitating P. putida S12 to survive and grow in the presence of toxic compounds or other environmental stresses. We wished to revisit and further scrutinize the role of pTTS12 in conferring solvent tolerance. To this end, we cured the megaplasmid from P. putida S12 and conclusively confirmed that the SrpABC efflux pump is the major contributor of solvent tolerance on the megaplasmid pTTS12. Importantly, we identified a novel toxin-antitoxin module (proposed gene names slvT and slvA respectively) encoded on pTTS12 which contributes to the solvent tolerant phenotype and is essential in conferring genetic stability to the megaplasmid. Chromosomal introduction of the srp operon in combination with slvAT gene pair created a solvent tolerance phenotype in non-solvent tolerant strains such as P. putida KT2440, E. coli TG1, and E. coli BL21(DE3).

ImportanceSustainable alternatives for high-value chemicals can be achieved by using renewable feedstocks in bacterial biocatalysis. However, during bioproduction of such chemicals and biopolymers, aromatic compounds that function as products, substrates or intermediates in the production process may exert toxicity to microbial host cells and limit the production yield. Therefore, solvent-tolerance is a highly preferable trait for microbial hosts in the biobased production of aromatic chemicals and biopolymers. In this study, we revisit the essential role of megaplasmid pTTS12 from solvent-tolerant P. putida S12 for molecular adaptation to organic solvent. In addition to the RND efflux pump (SrpABC), we identified a novel toxin-antitoxin module (SlvAT) which contributes to tolerance in low solvent concentration as well as to genetic stability of pTTS12. These two gene clusters were successfully transferred to non-solvent tolerant strains of P. putida and to E. coli strains to confer and enhance solvent tolerance.","NA"

In addition, we observed a distinct architecture in which the {beta}' zinc binding domain (ZBD) of RNAP stretches out from its canonical position to interact with the upstream non-template strand.

Moreover, increased insulin in the circulation may contribute to fatty liver disease. Medical interventions aimed at alleviating ER stress in {beta} cells while maintaining optimal insulin secretion are therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy for T2D. Previously, we demonstrated that germline Chop gene deletion preserved {beta} cells in high fat diet (HFD) fed mice and in leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice. In the current study, we further investigated whether targeting Chop/Ddit3 specifically in murine {beta} cells confers therapeutic benefits. First, we show that Chop deletion in {beta} cells alleviates {beta} cell ER stress and delays glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in HFD fed mice. Second, importantly, {beta} cell-specific Chop deletion prevented liver steatosis and hepatomegaly in aged HFD fed mice without affecting basal glucose homeostasis. Third, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that ER remodeling secondary to Chop deletion modulates glucose-induced islet Ca2+ oscillations. Finally, using state-of-the-art GLP1-conjugated Chop AntiSense Oligonucleotides (GLP1-Chop ASO), we demonstrated that the Chop deletion induced GSIS change is a long term complex event in {beta} cells.

For this study, we have developed stable transgenic lines of chilli and tomato expressing CgCOM1-RNAi construct employing Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic plants were characterized by molecular and gene expression analyses. Production of specific CgCOM1 siRNA in transgenic chilli and tomato RNAi lines was confirmed by stem-loop RT-PCR. Fungal challenge assays on leaves and fruits showed that the transgenic lines were resistant to anthracnose disease-causing C. gloeosporioides in comparison to wild type and empty-vector control plants. RT-qPCR analyses in transgenic lines revealed barely any CgCOM1 transcripts in the C. gloeosporioides infected tissues, indicating near complete silencing of CgCOM1 gene expression in the pathogen. Microscopic examination of the Cg-challenged leaves of chilli-CgCOM1i lines revealed highly suppressed conidial germination, germ tube development, appressoria formation and mycelial growth of C. gloeosporioides, resulting in reduced infection of plant tissues.

Disease mutations reside within the G/F domain of DNAJB6, but the molecular mechanisms underlying dysfunction are not well understood. Using yeast, cell culture, and mouse models of LGMD1D, we find that the toxicity associated with disease-associated DNAJB6 requires its interaction with HSP70, and that abrogating this interaction genetically or with small molecules is protective. In skeletal muscle, DNAJB6 localizes to the Z-disc with HSP70. Whereas HSP70 normally diffuses rapidly between the Z-disc and sarcoplasm, the rate of HSP70s diffusion in LGMD1D mouse muscle is diminished likely because it has an unusual affinity for the Z-disc and mutant DNAJB6. Treating LGMD1D mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the DNAJ-HSP70 complex re-mobilizes HSP70, improves strength and corrects myopathology. These data support a model in which LGMD1D mutations in DNAJB6 are a gain-of-function disease that is, counter-intuitively, mediated via HSP70 binding. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting HSP70:DNAJB6 may be effective in treating this inherited muscular dystrophy.","NA"

Surprisingly, neuronal activity of the GPe units exhibited diverse patterns in timing and polarity (increase/decrease) of firing rate modulations during and after CNO injection. Nevertheless, decreases were exclusive and stronger after CNO injection. In contrast, only one unit modulated its activity after CNO injection in DREADD-free GPe. Moreover, post-mortem histochemical analysis revealed that hM4Di DREADDs were expressed at high level in the GPe neurons located in the vicinity of the viral construct injection sites.

Studies exploring human inference as a dynamical process that unfolds in time have focused on situations in which the statistics of observations are history-independent. Yet temporal structure is everywhere in nature, and yields history-dependent observations. Do humans modify their inference processes depending on the latent temporal statistics of their observations? We investigate this question experimentally and theoretically using a change-point inference task. We show that humans adapt their inference process to fine aspects of the temporal structure in the statistics of stimuli. As such, humans behave qualitatively in a Bayesian fashion, but, quantitatively, deviate away from optimality. Perhaps more importantly, humans behave suboptimally in that their responses are not deterministic, but variable. We show that this variability itself is modulated by the temporal statistics of stimuli. To elucidate the cognitive algorithm that yields this behavior, we investigate a broad array of existing and new models that characterize different sources of suboptimal deviations away from Bayesian inference. While models with  output noise that corrupts the response-selection process are natural candidates, human behavior is best described by sampling-based inference models, in which the main ingredient is a compressed approximation of the posterior, represented through a modest set of random samples and updated over time. This result comes to complement a growing literature on sample-based representation and learning in humans.","NA"

Weakly electric fish generate a species- and individual-specific electric organ discharge (EOD) and therefore provide a unique opportunity for individual tracking without tagging. We here present and test tracking algorithms based on recordings with submerged electrode arrays. Harmonic structures extracted from power spectra provide fish identity. Localization of fish based on weighted averages of their EOD amplitudes is found to be more robust than fitting a dipole model. We apply these techniques to monitor a community of three species, Apteronotus rostratus, Eigenmannia humboldtii, and Sternopygus dariensis, in their natural habitat in Darien, Panama. We found consistent upstream movements after sunset followed by downstream movements in the second half of the night. Extrapolations of these movements and estimates of fish density obtained from additional transect data suggest that some fish cover at least several hundreds of meters of the stream per night. Most fish, including Eigenmannia, were traversing the electrode array solitarily. From in-situ measurements of the decay of the EOD amplitude with distance of individual animals we estimated that fish can detect conspecifics at distances of up to 2 m. Our recordings also emphasize the complexity of natural electrosensory scenes resulting from the interactions of the EODs of different species. Electrode arrays thus provide an unprecedented window into the so-far hidden nocturnal activities of multispecies communities of weakly electric fish at an unmatched level of detail.

Such developmental signalling for extracellularly-acting cAMP is well studied in the popular dictyostelid, Dictyostelium discoideum, and is mediated by a distinct family ( class E) of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) collectively designated as the cAMP receptors (cARs).

Darwin believed that the peacocks long train has developed as a result of female choice favouring long-tailed mates because of the trains beauty, in which iridescent eyespots play a major role. Female choice theory requires genetic variation in female preference and in the number of eyespots and a genetic correlation between the two, yet there is little variation in either of these traits in natural and feral peafowl populations. We examined the anatomical plan of feather development and found that eyespot feather follicles originate in alternating rows of 10-11; this precludes intrinsic one-at-a-time eyespot variation. The developmentally determined annual addition of new feathers results in a fixed number of total feathers in fully mature individuals. Feather number and coordinated growth of feather length together determine the size of the train, which we propose would have an asymptotic fitness function due to the aging of the male. These results confirm previous speculations that eyespot number may be anatomically determined and complement recent findings indicating that eyespot number alone does not determine reproductive success. We propose an alternate hypothesis: that the driving force behind female attraction and female mate choice is male drive, or male-driven female choice based on male (train) size, quality and vigor, and variation in train display, and not eyespot number. In other words, we propose that, contrary to Darwins premise, the beauty (eyespot) does not drive the train; rather, it rides the train. The theory proposed here not only provides a simple mechanism for the evolution of the peacocks train, but it also explains past, often contradictory, results. A detailed longitudinal study with cohorts would be ideal to shed light on the details of the process.","NA"

It is caused by reptarenavirus infection, which can persist over several years without overt signs, but is generally associated with the eventual death of the affected snakes. Thus far, reports have confirmed existence of reptarenaviruses in captive snakes in North America, Europe, and Australia, but there is no evidence that it also occurs in wild snakes. BIBD affects both boas and pythons, the habitats of which do not naturally overlap. Herein, we studied Brazilian captive snakes with BIBD using a metatranscriptomic approach, and report the identification of novel reptarenaviruses, hartmaniviruses, and a new species in the family Chuviridae. The reptarenavirus L segments identified represent six novel species, while we only found a single novel reptarenavirus S segment. Until now, hartmaniviruses had been identified only in European captive boas with BIBD, and the present results increase the number of known hartmanivirus species from four to six. The newly identified chuvirus showed 38.4%, 40.9%, and 48.1% amino acid identity to the nucleoprotein, glycoprotein, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of its closest relative, Guangdong red-banded snake chuvirus-like virus. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the found viruses originated from imported snakes, the results suggest that the viruses would circulate in indigenous snake populations.

IMPORTANCEBoid Inclusion Body Disease (BIBD) caused by reptarenavirus infection affects captive snake populations worldwide, but the reservoir hosts of reptarenaviruses remain unknown. Herein, we report the identification of novel reptarenavirus and hartmanivirus species, and a chuvirus in captive Brazilian boas with BIBD. Three of the four snakes studied showed co-infection with all three viruses, and one of the snakes harbored three novel reptarenavirus L and one novel S segment. The samples originated from collections with Brazilian indigenous snakes only, which could indicate that these viruses circulate in wild snakes. The findings could further indicate that boid snakes are the natural reservoir of reptarena- and hartmaniviruses commonly found in captive snakes. The snakes infected with the novel chuvirus all suffered from BIBD; it is therefore not possible to comment on its potential pathogenicity and contribution to the observed changes in the present case material.","10.1128/JVI.00001-20"

Compare to healthy controls, survivors expressed motivations and barriers specifically related to their oncological disease. Running was a challenge with their cancer and a hope to give to other patients. Main barriers were represented by treatment-related side effects, inexperienced trainers and external factors, e.g. delivery of incorrect information. Running program dedicated to oncological patients should consider intrinsic obstacles, related to cancer and its treatment, offering a personalized intervention performed by qualified trainers, together with a motivational approach able to improve participants adherence to an active lifestyle.","10.1371/journal.pone.0227846"

We evaluated the outcomes of second/third-line treatment of LEN, investigated the sensitivity of SOR-resistant HCC cell line (PLC/PRF5-R2) to LEN, and their signal transduction pathway by protein array analysis.

MethodsWe retrospectively enrolled 57 unresectable HCC patients. Radiologic responses in 53 patients were evaluated by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Active signal transduction pathways in cells were identified by protein array analysis, including 1205 proteins.

ResultsPatients comprised 34 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-naive (first-line), nine SOR-intolerant (second-line), and ten resistant to regorafenib (third-line). Objective response rates (ORRs) were 61.8% (21/34) in TKI-naive, 33.3% (3/9) in second-line, and 20.0% (2/10) in third-line groups. The overall survival (OS) and the progression free survival (PFS) in the first-line was significantly longer than those in third-line group (p<0.05). Patients with better liver functional reserve (Child score, ALBI grade) exhibited higher ORR and longer OS. LEN was well-tolerated as second/third-line treatment. The IC50 value of LEN against PLC/PRF5-R2 cells (30 M) was significantly higher than that against PLC/PRF5 cells (6.4 M). LEN inhibited significantly more signal transduction pathways related to FRS2, a crucial FGFR downstream molecule, in PLC/PRF5 than PLC/PRF5-R2 cells.

ConclusionsLEN was active and safe as a second/third-line treatment for unresectable HCC. LEN seems to be more effective for HCC patients with better hepatic reserve function or before TKI-resistance is acquired because of partial cross-resistance to SOR.","NA"

This procedure is in contrast to most other analyses of trait selection, where it is the community weighted mean of the traits that is used as the dependent variable.

Understanding the mechanisms that drive these dynamics requires integrating individual-level biology with comparisons across multiple social networks.
C_LIO_LITestosterone is a key regulator of vertebrate social behavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that testosterone can influence how individuals interact with social partners. Although the effects of testosterone on individual behaviors are well established, no study has examined whether hormone-mediated behavior can scale up to shape the emergent structure of social groups.
C_LIO_LIWe tested this hypothesis in the wire-tailed manakin, a bird species in which the males cooperate at specialized courtship sites known as leks. We used an automated proximity system to longitudinally monitor multiple leks and quantify the social network interactions at each site. Our analysis examines three emergent properties of the social networks that are expected to enhance the benefits of cooperative behavior: social specialization (the exclusivity of relationships), network stability (the overall persistence of partnerships through time), and behavioral assortment (the tendency for like to associate with like).
C_LIO_LIThe manakin leks with higher-testosterone dominant males were less specialized, less stable, and had more negative behavioral assortment, after accounting for other factors. These results support our main hypothesis that individual-level hormone physiology can predict group-level network dynamics. We also observed that larger leks with more interacting individuals had more positive behavioral assortment. This suggests that small groups may constrain processes of homophily and behavior-matching.
C_LIO_LIOverall, these results provide evidence that hormones can act as an extended phenotype that shapes the broader architecture of social groups. High-testosterone groups exhibit collective behaviors that are predicted to impede the evolution of cooperation.

Here we use high-quality genome assemblies to study evolutionary dynamics of two complex satDNAs, Rsp-like and 1.688 gm/cm3, in Drosophila melanogaster and its three nearest relatives in the simulans clade. We show that large blocks of these repeats are highly dynamic in the heterochromatin, where their genomic location varies across species. We discovered that small blocks of satDNA that are abundant in X chromosome euchromatin are similarly dynamic, with repeats changing in abundance, location, and composition among species. We detail the proliferation of a rare satellite (Rsp-like) across the X chromosome in D. simulans and D. mauritiana. Rsp-like spreads by inserting into existing clusters of the older, more abundant 1.688 satellite, in events that were likely facilitated by microhomology-mediated repair pathways. We show that Rsp-like is abundant on extrachromosomal circular DNA in D. simulans, which may have contributed to its dynamic evolution. Intralocus satDNA expansions via unequal exchange and the movement of higher-order repeats also contribute to the fluidity of the repeat landscape. We find evidence that euchromatic satDNA repeats experience cycles of proliferation and diversification somewhat analogous to bursts of transposable element proliferation.

These events are predominantly mediated by integrins, the principal cellular adhesion receptors located at the cell/extracellular matrix (ECM) interface.

Because of the typical piconewton force range and nanometre length scale of mechanotransductive interactions, achieving a detailed understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics occurring at the cell/microenvironment interface is challenging; sophisticated interdisciplinary methodologies are required. Moreover, an accurate control over the nanotopographical features of the microenvironment is essential, in order to systematically investigate and precisely assess the influence of the different nanotopographical motifs on the mechanotransductive process.

In this framework, we were able to study and quantify the impact of microenvironmental nanotopography on early cellular adhesion events by means of adhesion force spectroscopy based on innovative colloidal probes mimicking the nanotopography of natural ECMs.

These probes provided the opportunity to detect nanotopography-specific modulations of the molecular force loading dynamics and integrin clustering at the level of single binding events, in the critical time window of nascent adhesion formation. Following this approach, we found that the nanotopographical features are responsible for an excessive force loading in single adhesion sites after 20 - 60 s of interaction, causing a drop in the number of adhesion sites. However, by manganese treatment we demonstrated that the availability of activated integrins is a critical regulatory factor for these nanotopography-dependent dynamics.","NA"

Given the variety of methods and implementations available, it is natural to ask how the convergence rates and final predictions of these methods compare. In this study, we describe the concept and results for the SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge, the first challenge from the SAMPL series focusing on the assessment of convergence properties and reproducibility of binding free energy methodologies. We provided parameter files, partial charges, and multiple initial geometries for two octa-acid (OA) and one cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) host-guest systems. Participants submitted binding free energy predictions as a function of the number of force and energy evaluations for seven different alchemical and physical-pathway (i.e., potential of mean force and weighted ensemble of trajectories) methodologies implemented with the GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD, or OpenMM simulation engines. To rank the methods, we developed an efficiency statistic based on bias and variance of the free energy estimates. For the two small OA binders, the free energy estimates computed with alchemical and potential of mean force approaches show relatively similar variance and bias as a function of the number of energy/force evaluations, with the attach-pull-release (APR), GROMACS expanded ensemble, and NAMD double decoupling submissions obtaining the greatest efficiency. The differences between the methods increase when analyzing the CB8-quinine system, where both the guest size and correlation times for system dynamics are greater. For this system, nonequilibrium switching (GROMACS/NS-DS/SB) obtained the overall highest efficiency. Surprisingly, the results suggest that specifying force field parameters and partial charges is insufficient to generally ensure reproducibility, and we observe differences between seemingly converged predictions ranging approximately from 0.3 to 1.0 kcal/mol, even with almost identical simulations parameters and system setup (e.g., Lennard-Jones cutoff, ionic composition). Further work will be required to completely identify the exact source of these discrepancies. Among the conclusions emerging from the data, we found that Hamiltonian replica exchange--while displaying very small variance--can be affected by a slowly-decaying bias that depends on the initial population of the replicas, that bidirectional estimators are significantly more efficient than unidirectional estimators for nonequilibrium free energy calculations for systems considered, and that the Berendsen barostat introduces non-negligible artifacts in expanded ensemble simulations.","10.1007/s10822-020-00290-5"

In commercial pig production, animals are transported between farms based on growth stages, thus it generates time-varying contact networks that will influence the dynamics of disease spread. Still, risk-based surveillance strategies are mostly based on a static network. In this study, we reconstructed the static and temporal pig networks of one Brazilian state from 2017 to 2018, comprising 351,519 movements and 48 million transported pigs. The static networks failed to capture time-respecting movement pathways. Therefore, we propose a time-dependent network susceptible-infected (SI) model to simulate the temporal spread of an epidemic over the pig network globally through the temporal movement of animals among farms, and locally with a stochastic compartmental model in each farm, configured to calculate the minimum number of target farms needed to achieve effective disease control. In addition, we propagated disease on the pig temporal network to calculate the cumulative contacts as a proxy of epidemic sizes and evaluated the impact of network-based disease control strategies. The results show that targeting the first 1,000 farms ranked by degree would be sufficient and feasible to diminish disease spread considerably. Our finding also suggested that assuming a worst-case scenario in which every movement transmit disease, pursuing farms by degree would limit the transmission to up to 29 farms over the two years period, which is lower than the number of infected farms for random surveillance, with epidemic sizes of 2,593 farms. The top 1,000 farms could benefit from enhanced biosecurity plans and improved surveillance, which constitute important next steps in strategizing targeted disease control interventions. Overall, the proposed modeling framework provides a parsimonious solution for targeted disease surveillance when temporal movement data is available.","NA"

In this paper, we report a microfluidic co-culture device that physically isolates synapses from pre- and postsynaptic neurons and chronically exposes them to toxic amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptides secreted by model cell lines overexpressing wild-type or mutated (V717I) amyloid precursor protein (APP). Co-culture with cells overexpressing mutated APP exposed the synapses of primary hippocampal neurons to A{beta}1-42 molecules at nanomolar concentrations and induced a significant decrease in synaptic connectivity, as evidenced by distance-based assignment of postsynaptic puncta to presynaptic puncta. Treating the cells with antibodies that target different forms of A{beta} suggested that low molecular weight oligomers are the likely culprit.

Importantly, we equalized detection sensitivity across dimensions using an adaptive titration procedure. Computational modeling of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity first revealed that premotor EEG activity scales with the amount of perceptual evidence earlier, around 150ms, when the decision concerns emotion rather than color. Second, participant choice was decoded earlier during emotion (260ms) than color decisions in band-limited EEG power in the same premotor regions.

Following several biased (prior) location discriminations, subsequent (test) discriminations were biased toward the prior choices, even when reported via different motor actions, and when prior and test stimuli differed in color. By contrast, biased discriminations about an irrelevant stimulus feature did not substantially influence subsequent location discriminations. Additionally, biased stimulus locations, when color was discriminated, no longer substantially influenced subsequent location decisions. Hence, the degree of relevance between prior and subsequent perceptual decisions is a key factor for serial dependence. This suggests that serial-dependence reflects a high-level mechanism by which the brain predicts and interprets incoming sensory information in accordance with relevant prior choices.","NA"

Here we examine the cellular mediators underlying TLR4 regulation of dentate excitability and its impact on memory performance. In ex vivo slices, astrocytic and microglial metabolic inhibitors selectively abolished TLR4 antagonist modulation of excitability in controls, without impacting FPI rats, demonstrating that glial signaling contributes to TLR4 regulation of excitability in controls. In glia-depleted neuronal cultures from naive mice, TLR4 ligands bidirectionally modulated AMPAR charge transfer demonstrating the ability of neuronal TLR4 to regulate excitability, as observed after brain injury. In vivo TLR4 antagonism reduced early post-injury increases in mediators of MyD88-dependent and independent TLR4 signaling without altering expression in controls. Blocking TNF, a downstream effector of TLT4, mimicked effects of TLR4 antagonist and occluded TLR4 agonist modulation of excitability in slices from both control and FPI rats. Functionally, transiently blocking TLR4 in vivo improved impairments in working memory observed one week and one month after FPI, while the same treatment impaired memory function in uninjured controls. Together these data identify that distinct cellular signaling mechanisms converge on TNF to mediate TLR4 modulation of network excitability in the uninjured and injured brain and demonstrate a role for TLR4 in regulation of working memory function.

However, it is unknown whether the methylomes of muscle stem cells overlap that of skeletal muscle tissue and how age modulates this overlap.

MethodsUsing high coverage DNA methylation arrays (850K CpG sites) we compared the methylomes of young/aged human skeletal muscle to that of young/aged muscle stem cells at several time points of differentiation (0, 72 hrs, 7, 10 days).

ResultsAged muscle tissue was hypermethylated compared with young tissue, enriched for;  pathways-in-cancer (that combines; focal adhesion, MAPK signaling, PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling, p53 signaling, Jak-STAT signaling, TGF-beta and notch signaling),  rap1-signaling,  axon-guidance and  hippo-signalling. Aged muscle stem cells also demonstrated a hypermethylated profile in pathways;  axon-guidance,  adherens-junction and  calcium-signaling pathways, particularly at later timepoints of myotube formation, corresponding with reduced morphological differentiation and reductions in MyoD/Myogenin gene expression compared with young cells. While young cells showed less variability in DNA methylation during differentiation, aged cells demonstrated extensive and significantly varied DNA methylation at 7 days of differentiation in pathways;  regulation-of-localisation,  regulation-of-cell-communication and  regulation-of signaling. We also identified CpG sites whose hypermethylated state with age was retained in muscle cells in-vitro once isolated from tissue in-vivo (on genes KIF15, DYRK2, FHL2, MRPS33, ABCA17P). Differential chromosomal region analysis identified 3 regions with 6-8 CpGs in the Homeobox (HOX) transcription factor family of genes that were altered with age in muscle tissue and cells. With, HOXD10, HOXD9, HOXD8, HOXA3, HOXC9, HOXB1, HOXB3, HOXC-AS2 and HOXC10 all significantly differentially hypermethylated in aged tissue. In aged cells the same HOX genes (and additionally HOXC-AS3) also displayed the most varied methylation at 7 days of differentiation versus young cells. With HOXD8, HOXC9, HOXB1 and HOXC-AS3 hypermethylated and HOXC10 and HOXC-AS2 hypomethylated. We also determined inverse relationships between mRNA expression and DNA methylation in HOXB1, HOXA3 and HOXC-AS3. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that increased physical activity in young adults was associated with oppositely regulating HOXB1, HOXA3 and HOXC10 compared with age.

ConclusionFor the first time, we demonstrate HOX genes were differentially epigenetically regulated in aged human skeletal muscle and stem cells and increased physical activity may help prevent the age-related epigenetic changes observed in the HOX genes.","NA"

Methods and ResultsTo determine whether hypercholesterolemia accelerates the initiation of AAAs, male low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor -/- mice were either fed one week of Western diet prior to starting AngII infusion or initiated Western diet one week after starting AngII infusion. During the first week of AngII infusion, mice fed normal diet had less luminal expansion of the suprarenal aorta compared to those initiated Western diet after the first week of AngII infusion. The two groups achieved comparable luminal dilation on week 2 through week 6 of AngII infusion as monitored by ultrasound. To determine whether hypercholesterolemia contributed to the progression of established AAAs, male LDL receptor -/- mice were fed Western diet and infused with AngII for 4 weeks. Mice with established AAAs were then stratified into two groups based on luminal diameters measured by ultrasound. While AngII infusion was continued for another 8 weeks in both groups, mice in one group were continuously fed Western diet, but diet in the other group was switched to normal laboratory diet. In the latter group, plasma cholesterol concentrations were reduced rapidly to approximately 500 mg/dl within one week after the diet was switched from Western diet to normal laboratory diet. Luminal expansion progressed constantly in mice continuously fed Western diet, whereas no continuous expansion was detected in mice that were switched to normal laboratory diet.

ConclusionsHypercholesterolemia accelerates both the initiation of AAAs and progression of established AAAs in AngII-infused male LDL receptor -/- mice.

Clinical RelevanceHypercholesterolemia is modestly associated with AAAs in observational or retrospective clinical studies. It is not feasible to study whether hypercholesterolemia contributes to the initiation of AAAs or progression of established AAAs in human. This study using AngII-induced AAA mouse model provides solid evidence that hypercholesterolemia contributes to both the initiation and progression of AAAs, supporting that statin therapy at any stage of AAA development may be beneficial to hypercholesterolemic patients with AAAs.","NA"

However, de novo building of atomic models from near-atomic resolution (3-5 [A]) cryo-EM density maps is a challenging task, in particular since poorly resolved side-chain densities hamper sequence assignment by automatic procedures at a lower resolution. Furthermore, segmentation of EM density maps into individual subunits remains a difficult problem when no three-dimensional structures of these subunits exist, or when significant conformational changes occur between the isolated and complexed form of the subunits. To tackle these issues, we have developed a graph-based method to thread most of the C- trace of the protein backbone into the EM density map. The EM density is described as a weighted graph such that the resulting minimum spanning tree encompasses the high-density regions of the map. A pruning algorithm cleans the tree and finds the most probable positions of the C- atoms, using side-chain density when available, as a collection of C- trace fragments. By complementing experimental EM maps with contact predictions from sequence co-evolutionary information, we demonstrate that our approach can correctly segment EM maps into individual subunits and assign amino acids sequence to backbone traces to generate full-atom models.","NA"

We hypothesised that inclusion of the adjuvant cGAMP within viral vaccine vectors would promote adaptive immunity against vector antigens. We immunised mice with virus-like particles (VLPs) containing the HIV-1 Gag protein and VSV-G. Inclusion of cGAMP within these VLPs augmented splenic VLP-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. It also increased VLP- and VSV-G-specific serum antibody titres and enhanced in vitro virus neutralisation. The superior antibody response was accompanied by increased numbers of T follicular helper cells in draining lymph nodes. Vaccination with cGAMP-loaded VLPs containing haemagglutinin induced high titres of influenza A virus neutralising antibodies and conferred protection following subsequent influenza A virus challenge. Together, these results show that incorporating cGAMP into VLPs enhances their immunogenicity, making cGAMP-VLPs an attractive platform for novel vaccination strategies.

The cochlear sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, vibrates due to external and internal excitations. The external stimulation is acoustic pressures mediated by the scala fluids, while the internal excitation is generated by a type of sensory receptor cells (the outer hair cells) in response to the acoustical vibrations. The outer hair cells are cellular actuators that are responsible for cochlear amplification. The organ of Corti is highly structured for transmitting vibrations originating from acoustic pressure and active outer hair cell force to the inner hair cells that synapse on afferent nerves. Understanding how the organ of Corti vibrates due to acoustic pressure and outer hair cell force is critical for explaining cochlear function. In this study, excised cochlear turns were freshly isolated from young gerbils. The organ of Corti in the excised cochlea was subjected to mechanical and electrical stimulation that are analogous to acoustical and cellular stimulation in the natural cochlea. Organ of Corti vibrations including those of individual outer hair cells were measured using optical coherence tomography. Respective vibration patterns due to mechanical and electrical stimulation were characterized. Interactions between the two vibration patterns were investigated by applying the two forms of stimulation simultaneously. Our results show that the interactions could be either constructive or destructive, which implies that the outer hair cells can either amplify or suppress vibrations in the organ of Corti. We discuss a potential consequence of the two interaction modes for cochlear frequency tuning.

Statement of SignificanceThe function of the mammalian cochlea is characterized by sharp tuning and high-level of amplification. Both tuning and amplification are achieved mechanically through the action of cellular actuators in the sensory epithelium. According to widely accepted theory, cochlear tuning is achieved by  selectively amplifying acoustic vibrations. This study presents a set of data suggesting that the cochlear actuators can both amplify and suppress vibrations to enhance cochlear tuning. Presented results will explain why the actuator cells in the cochlea spend energy in the locations where there is no need for amplification.","NA"

Activity of immune response may not be specific to the sex that produces the eggs but could correlate with the amount of parental investment given. Informed by experimental data, we designed a theoretical framework that combines multiple life-history traits. We disentangled sex-biased life-history strategies from a particular sex to include species with reversed sex-roles, and male parental investment. We computed the lifetime reproductive success from the fitness components arising from diverse sex-biased life-history traits, and observed a strong bias in adult sex ratio depending on sex-specific resource allocation towards life-history traits.

Synthesis of the metabolic intermediate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) was required to specifically drive IL-10 production, and to attenuate Th1 responses. Furthermore, GGPP-dependent protein modifications controlled signaling through PI3K{delta}-AKT-GSK3, which in turn promoted BLIMP1-dependent IL-10 production. Inherited gene mutations in cholesterol metabolism result in a severe autoinflammatory syndrome, termed mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD). Consistent with our findings, B cells from MKD patients induced poor IL-10 responses and were functionally impaired. Moreover, metabolic supplementation with GGPP was able to reverse this defect. Collectively, our data define cholesterol metabolism as an integral metabolic pathway for the optimal functioning of human IL-10 producing regulatory B cells.

The third enzyme, malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (pt/mtMCAT) catalyzes the reaction that loads the mtFAS system with substrate, by malonylating the phosphopantetheinyl cofactor of acyl carrier protein (ACP). GFP-transgenic experiments determined the dual localization of these enzymes, which were validated by the characterization of mutant alleles, which were transgenically rescued by transgenes that were singularly retargeted to either plastids or mitochondria. The singular retargeting of these proteins to plastids rescued the embryo-lethality associated with disruption of the essential ptFAS system, but these rescued plants display phenotypes typical of the lack of mtFAS function. Specifically, these phenotypes include reduced lipoylation of the H subunit of the glycine decarboxylase complex, the hyperaccumulation of glycine, and reduced growth; all these traits are reversible by growing these plants in an elevated CO2 atmosphere, which suppresses mtFAS-associated, photorespiration-dependent chemotypes.","NA"

To use these technologies, users have to learn a query language such as SPARQL in order to ask complex queries such as  What are the drugs associated with the disease breast carcinoma and Osteoporosis but not the gene ESR1. BEE was developed to overcome the limitations and difficulties of learning such query languages. Our proposed system provides an intuitive and effective query interface based on natural language.

We have previously demonstrated that its UCS domain is responsible for the chaperone-like properties of UNC-45B. In order to better understand the chaperoning function of the UCS domain we engineered mutations designed to: i) disrupt chaperone-client interactions by removing and altering the structure of the putative client-interacting loop and ii) disrupt chaperone-client interactions by changing highly conserved residues in the putative client-binding groove. We tested the effect of these mutations by using a novel combination of complementary biophysical (circular dichroism, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, chaperone activity, and SAXS) and in vivo tools (C. elegans sarcomere structure). Removing the client-holding loop had a pronounced effect on the secondary structure, thermal stability, solution conformation and chaperone function of the UCS domain. These results are consistent with previous in vivo findings that this mutation neither rescue the defect in C. elegans sarcomere organization nor bind to myosin. We found that mutating several conserved residues in the client-binding groove do not affect UCS domain secondary structure or structural stability but reduced its chaperoning activity. We found that these groove mutations also significantly altered the structure and organization of the worm sarcomeres. We also tested the effect of R805W, a mutation distant from the client-binding region. Our in vivo data show that, to our surprise, the R805W mutation appeared to have the most drastic effect on the structure and organization of the worm sarcomeres. In humans, the R805W mutation segregates with human congenital/infantile cataract, indicating a crucial role of R805 in UCS domain stability and/or client interaction. Hence, our experimental approach combining biophysical and biological tools facilitates the study of myosin/chaperone interactions in mechanistic detail.

Statement of SignificanceThe folding of myosin and the assembly of a functional sarcomere requires the chaperone UNC-45B. The molecular mechanism(s) for how UNC-45B assist in this assembly process or prevent stress-induced aggregation states are presently unknown. Answering this question is a problem at the core of muscle development and function. Here we developed a novel approach that combines biophysical and biological tools to study UNC-45B/myosin interactions in mechanistic detail. Our approach may provide critical insights into the molecular nature of the pathogenesis of many muscle disorders stemming from mutations in sarcomeric proteins including skeletal myopathies and cardiomyopathies, and possibly the age-associated decline in muscle mass and function found in the elderly known as sarcopenia.","NA"

CRC cells expressing TdTomato protein and shTNS4/shLUC hairpin oligos were grown in 3D spheroids with and without cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Adhesiveness to collagen I and CAFs was assessed in 2D and cell proliferation, volume and invasion were assessed in 3D conditions. The role of TNS4 knockdown in Gefitinib chemosensitivity and EGFR and Ras protein levels were also tested.

In general, TNS4 knockdown increased cell proliferation in cell lines producing compact spheroids. The addition of CAFs in spheroids supported CRC cells proliferation, whereas CAFs themselves did not proliferate, but increased ECM degradation. TNS4 knockdown reduced adhesiveness and 3D invasion and disrupted EGFR signalling which resulted in increased sensitivity to Gefitinib.

In conclusion, in a 3D spheroid model, TNS4 inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell invasion into the ECM, possibly by adhesion to the ECM and stromal cells. TNS4 knockdown enhances sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib and may be helpful for KRAS mutant CRC patients.","NA"

In some HIV-1 infected individuals, bnAbs evolve from precursor antibodies through affinity maturation. To induce bnAbs, a vaccine must mediate a similar process of antibody maturation. One way to test vaccination strategies is to immunize mouse models that express human bnAb precursors. Such immunization experiments can assess whether the vaccine can convert precursor antibody into bnAb. A major problem with such mouse models is that bnAb expression often hinders B cell development in the bone marrow. Such developmental blocks may be attributed to unusual properties of bnAb variable regions, such as poly-reactivity and long antigen-binding loops, which are often under negative selection during primary B cell development. To address this problem, we devised a method to circumvent B cell developmental block by expressing bnAbs conditionally in mature B cells. We validated this method by expressing the unmutated common ancestor (UCA) of the human VRC26 bnAb in transgenic mice. Constitutive expression of combined immunoglobulin heavy and light chains of VRC26UCA led to developmental arrest of B cell progenitors in the bone marrow; poly-reactivity of VRC26UCA and poor pairing of VRC26UCA IgH chain with mouse surrogate light chain may contribute to the phenotype. The conditional expression strategy circumvented this developmental impediment, allowing the VRC26UCA to be expressed in mature peripheral B cells. This method should be generally applicable for expressing other antibodies that are under negative selection during B cell development.

Significance statementMouse models can provide fast and cost-effective systems to test HIV-1 vaccine candidates at the pre-clinical stage. To serve this purpose, mouse models are engineered to express the precursors of human bnAbs against diverse HIV-1 strains. Immunization of such mouse models can evaluate the ability of vaccines to mature the precursor antibodies into bnAbs. However, due to unusual properties of bnAbs, mouse models expressing their precursors often have B cell developmental defects. In this study, we devised and validated a strategy to address this problem. This method could also facilitate the expression of other clinically relevant antibodies in mature B cells in transgenic mice; immunization of such mice could be used to generate novel antibodies with desirable properties.","10.1073/pnas.1921996117"

We characterize parasites within genotypic clusters, defined as identical by a 24-SNP molecular barcode and a haplotype identifier for other highly polymorphic loci; we measure expression of variant surface antigens (VSA) such as PfEMP-1 by transcript expression typing and expressed var DBL1 sequencing in ex vivo and short-term adapted RNA samples; and we measure IgG responses against VSAs from short-term adapted parasites. We find that parasites within genotypic clusters are genetically identical at other highly polymorphic loci. These parasites express similar Ups var classes and largely the same dominant var DBL1 sequences ex vivo. These parasites are recognized similarly by anti-VSA antibodies after short-term adaptation to culture; however, antibody responses do not correlate with genotype frequencies over time. Both genotype-specific and multiple genotype-reactive surface IgG responses are observed in this population. Parasites with identical genomes are extremely similar in their expression and host antibody recognition of VSAs. Monitoring changes in population-level parasite genomics and transmission dynamics is critical, as fluctuations will influence the breadth of resulting host immune responses to circulating parasite genotypes. These findings suggest shared immune recognition of genetically similar parasites, which has implications for both our understanding of immunity and vaccine development strategies in malaria elimination settings.","NA"

Achieving one of these goals often requires sacrificing the other to some degree, producing a stability-flexibility tradeoff. Individuals navigate this tradeoff in different ways, with some people learning rapidly (emphasizing flexibility) and others relying more heavily on historical information (emphasizing stability). Despite the prominence of such individual differences in learning tasks, the degree to which they relate to broader characteristics of real-world behavior or pathologies has not been well explored. Here we relate individual differences in learning behavior to self-report measures thought to collectively capture characteristics of the Autism spectrum. We show that that young adults who learn most slowly tend to integrate more effective samples into their beliefs about the world making them more robust to noise (more stability), but are more likely to integrate information from previous contexts (less flexibility). We show that individuals who report paying more attention to detail tend to use high flexibility and low stability information processing strategies. We demonstrate the robustness of this inverse relationship between attention to detail and formation of stable beliefs in a heterogeneous population of children that includes a high proportion of Autism diagnoses. Together, our results highlight that attention to detail reflects an information processing policy that comes with a substantial downside, namely the ability to integrate data to overcome environmental noise.","NA"

This biodiversity is not distributed evenly throughout the complex fractal structures formed by individual tree crowns. They are non-stationary, constantly expose new surface habitat via growth, and create contrasting abiotic conditions. These features give rise to a range of vertical gradients in habitat optimality, heterogeneity, available surface area and time for succession - all known to be mechanisms shaping diversity patterns. Using a canopy crane facility and epiphytic lichens on Fraxinus excelsior and Quercus robur as model system, we aim to assess the relative importance as well as the interplay of these mechanisms in shaping biodiversity patterns within tree canopies by detecting their distinct mechanistic fingerprints. Lichen species richness exhibited a hump-shaped vertical pattern, skewed towards the top of the crown. This pattern was observable at both the level of individual plots and that of aggregate height layers and it was correlated with lichen cover. Also, a vertical gradient in species composition was found and could be related to species traits known to reflect successional niches such as dispersal mode and growth form. Habitat heterogeneity and available surface area have been found to have little effect on vertical lichen diversity patterns. We conclude that the vertical lichen diversity patterns in the tree crown are mainly shaped by the successional accumulation of species along a branch age gradient and a pronounced vertical gradient in environmental optimality from harshly exposed young branches at the top crown over suitable habitats with a balance in light and humidity towards the limiting light conditions in the dim understory.

Understanding how these different dimensions interact spatially is also important for gauging the potential for conservation success. Here, we use a guild of select mammalian carnivores (wild canids and hyenas) in India to (i) generate distribution maps at the spatial scale of administrative sub-districts, that is relevant to management, (ii) examine ecological, social and biogeographic factors associated with their distribution, quantify key threats, and identify areas important for their conservation, (iii) use prioritization tools for balancing habitat conservation, human needs and economic growth, and (iv) evaluate the spatial congruence between areas with high conservation potential, and areas currently in focus for protection efforts, conservation investments, and infrastructure development. We find that the current Protected Area system does not adequately cover or represent diverse habitats, that there is immense potential for States to increase financial investments towards alternative conservation strategies, and, most infrastructure projects may be jeopardizing important carnivore habitats.

Most trypanosomatids are transmitted to their mammalian hosts by insects, often belonging to Diptera (or true flies). With resistance to both vector-targeted pesticides and trypanocidal drugs being reported, there is a need for novel transmission blocking strategies to be developed. Studies using the blood-feeding vectors themselves are not broadly accessible, as such, new model systems are being developed to unpick insect-trypanosmatids interactions. One such case is the interactions between the model dipteran Drosophila melanogaster and its natural trypanosomatid Herpetomonas muscarum. Our previous work has found that much of the transcriptomic changes triggered in H. muscarum after ingestion by Drosophila reflect what is known for disease-causing trypanosomatids. Here we describe a set of tools to genetically manipulate the parasite and therefore create a truly tractable insect-parasite interaction system from both sides of this association. These include transgenic fluorescently tagged parasites to follow infection dynamics in the fly gut as well as iterations of plasmids that can be used for generating knock-in and knock-out strains. The tools presented in this short report will facilitate further characterisation of trypanosomatid establishment in a model dipteran.","10.1534/g3.120.401048"

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as regulators of AS through a range of molecular mechanisms. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the AS regulators NSRa and b, which affect auxin-driven lateral root formation, can interact with the ALTERNATIVE SPLICING COMPETITOR (ASCO) lncRNA. Here, we analyzed the effect of the knockdown and overexpression of ASCO at genome-wide level and found a high number of deregulated and differentially spliced genes, related to flagellin responses and biotic stress. In agreement, roots from ASCO-knocked down plants are more sensitive to flagellin. Surprisingly, only a minor subset of genes overlapped with the AS defects of the nsra/b double mutant. Using biotin-labelled oligonucleotides for RNA-mediated ribonucleoprotein purification, we found that ASCO binds to the highly conserved core spliceosome component PRP8a. ASCO deregulation impairs the recognition of specific flagellin-related transcripts by PRP8a and SmD1b, another spliceosome component, suggesting that ASCO function regulates AS through the interaction with multiple splicing factors. Hence, lncRNAs may interact in a dynamic network with many splicing factors to modulate transcriptome reprogramming in eukaryotes.","NA"

PEPPA implements a combination of tree- and synteny-based approaches to identify and exclude paralogous genes, which facilitates the ready construction of schemes for whole genome multi-locus sequence typing (wgMLST) and core genome MLST. PEPPA also implements similarity-based gene predictions that support consistent annotations of genes and pseudogenes in individual genomes, and which are nearly as accurate as expert manual curation. The PEPPA package includes PEPPA_parser, which calculates trees based on accessory gene content and MLST core genome allelic differences. We also present SimPan, a novel pipeline for simulating the evolution of a bacterial pan-genome. PEPPA was compared with four state-of-the-art pan-genome pipelines on both empirical and simulated datasets. It demonstrated greater accuracy and specificity than any other pipeline, and was almost as fast as any of them at calculating a pan-genome. To demonstrate its abilities, PEPPA was used to construct a Streptococcus pan-genome of >40,000 genes from 3,170 representative genomes spanning at least 80 species.

However, the question of how amplification of centrosomes alters the MT organization capacity is not well-studied. We developed a quantitative image-processing and machine learning-aided approach for the automated analysis of MT organization. We designed a convolutional neural network-based approach for detecting centrosomes and an automated pipeline for analyzing MT organization around centrosomes, encapsulated in a semi-automatic graphical tool. Using this tool, we analyzed the spatial distribution of PCM proteins, the growing ends of MTs and the total MT density in breast cancer cells. We find that breast cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes not only have increased PCM protein but also exhibit expansion in PCM size. Moreover, centrosome amplified cells have a greater MT density and more growing MT ends near centrosomes than unamplified cells. The semi-automated approach developed here enables facile, unbiased and quantitative measurements of centrosome aberrations. We show that these aberrations increase MT nucleation and promote changes to MT density and the spatial distribution of MTs around amplified centrosomes.","NA"

In breast cancer cells, ER genomic binding is enabled by FOXA1 and GATA3, but the transcription factors that control ER genomic binding in endometrial cancer cells remain unknown. We previously identified ETV4 as a candidate factor controlling ER genomic binding in endometrial cancer cells and here we explore the functional importance of ETV4. Homozygous deletion of ETV4, using CRISPR/Cas9, led to greatly reduced ER binding at the majority of loci normally bound by ER. Consistent with the dramatic loss of ER binding, the gene expression response to estradiol was dampened for most genes. ETV4 contributes to estrogen signaling in two distinct ways; ETV4 loss impacts chromatin accessibility at some ER bound loci and impairs ER nuclear translocation. The diminished estrogen signaling upon ETV4 deletion led to decreased growth, particularly in 3D culture where hollow organoids were formed and in vivo in the context of estrogen dependent growth. Our results show that ETV4 plays an important role in estrogen signaling in endometrial cancer cells.","10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-1382"

However, it remains unclear whether this overlap is driven by mediation of genetic effects on disease by expression levels, or whether it primarily reflects pleiotropic relationships instead. Here we introduce a new method, mediated expression score regression (MESC), to estimate disease heritability mediated by the cis-genetic component of assayed steady-state gene expression levels, using summary association statistics from GWAS and eQTL studies. We show that MESC produces robust estimates of expression-mediated heritability across a wide range of simulations. We applied MESC to GWAS summary statistics for 42 diseases and complex traits (average N = 323K) and cis-eQTL data across 48 tissues from the GTEx consortium. We determined that a statistically significant but low proportion of disease heritability (mean estimate 11% with S.E. 2%) is mediated by the cis-genetic component of assayed gene expression levels, with substantial variation across diseases (point estimates from 0% to 38%). We further partitioned expression-mediated heritability across various gene sets. We observed an inverse relationship between cis-heritability of expression and disease heritability mediated by expression, suggesting that genes with weaker eQTLs have larger causal effects on disease. Moreover, we observed broad patterns of expression-mediated heritability enrichment across functional gene sets that implicate specific gene sets in disease, including loss-of-function intolerant genes and FDA-approved drug targets. Our results demonstrate that eQTLs estimated from steady-state expression levels in bulk tissues are informative of regulatory disease mechanisms, but that such eQTLs are insufficient to explain the majority of disease heritability. Instead, additional assays are necessary to more fully capture the regulatory effects of GWAS variants.","NA"

Meanwhile, almost all tasks probing hippocampal recall also use explicit probes. Here, instead of requiring such an artificial probe, we tasked monkeys to freely view naturalistic videos, and only tested their memory implicitly via a novel v. repeat video condition. Notably, a large proportion of hippocampal neurons differentiated novel from repeat videos via firing rates, supporting the involvement of the hippocampus in implicit recognition memory. The majority of these neurons showed an enhancement in firing rate to repeat instead of novel videos, a pattern which has not previously been shown in hippocampus. However, there was no evidence of post-stimulus cued recall, as neurons only showed these signals during video stimulus presentation.

Additionally, devils are affected by two of the three known transmissible cancers in mammals. Unfortunately, little is known about of immune checkpoints in devils and other non-model species, largely due to a lack of species-specific reagents. We developed a simple cut-and-paste reagent development method applicable to any vertebrate species and show that immune checkpoint interactions are conserved across 160 million years of evolution. The inhibitory checkpoint molecule CD200 is highly expressed on devil facial tumor cells. We are the first to demonstrate that co-expression of CD200R1 can block CD200 expression. The evolutionarily conserved pathways suggest that naturally occurring cancers in devils and other species can serve as models for understanding cancer and immunological tolerance.

Darwin believed that the peacocks long train has developed as a result of female choice favouring long-tailed mates because of the trains beauty, in which iridescent eyespots play a major role. Female choice theory requires genetic variation in female preference and in the number of eyespots and a genetic correlation between the two, yet there is little variation in either of these traits in natural and feral peafowl populations. We examined the anatomical plan of feather development and found that eyespot feather follicles originate in alternating rows of 10-11; this precludes intrinsic one-at-a-time eyespot variation. The developmentally determined annual addition of new feathers results in a fixed number of total feathers in fully mature individuals. Feather number and coordinated growth of feather length together determine the size of the train, which we propose would have an asymptotic fitness function due to the aging of the male. These results confirm previous speculations that eyespot number may be anatomically determined and complement recent findings indicating that eyespot number alone does not determine reproductive success. We propose an alternate hypothesis: that the driving force behind female attraction and female mate choice is male drive, or male-driven female choice based on male (train) size, quality and vigor, and variation in train display, and not eyespot number. In other words, we propose that, contrary to Darwins premise, the beauty (eyespot) does not drive the train; rather, it rides the train. The theory proposed here not only provides a simple mechanism for the evolution of the peacocks train, but it also explains past, often contradictory, results. A detailed longitudinal study with cohorts would be ideal to shed light on the details of the process.","NA"

MethodsWe retrospectively enrolled 57 unresectable HCC patients. Radiologic responses in 53 patients were evaluated by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Active signal transduction pathways in cells were identified by protein array analysis, including 1205 proteins.

ResultsPatients comprised 34 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-naive (first-line), nine SOR-intolerant (second-line), and ten resistant to regorafenib (third-line). Objective response rates (ORRs) were 61.8% (21/34) in TKI-naive, 33.3% (3/9) in second-line, and 20.0% (2/10) in third-line groups. The overall survival (OS) and the progression free survival (PFS) in the first-line was significantly longer than those in third-line group (p<0.05). Patients with better liver functional reserve (Child score, ALBI grade) exhibited higher ORR and longer OS. LEN was well-tolerated as second/third-line treatment. The IC50 value of LEN against PLC/PRF5-R2 cells (30 M) was significantly higher than that against PLC/PRF5 cells (6.4 M). LEN inhibited significantly more signal transduction pathways related to FRS2, a crucial FGFR downstream molecule, in PLC/PRF5 than PLC/PRF5-R2 cells.

ConclusionsLEN was active and safe as a second/third-line treatment for unresectable HCC. LEN seems to be more effective for HCC patients with better hepatic reserve function or before TKI-resistance is acquired because of partial cross-resistance to SOR.","NA"

About motivations, three sub-themes were identified: personal, interpersonal and environmental/organizational factors. Regarding barriers, another sub-theme was recognized: community/policy factors. Compare to healthy controls, survivors expressed motivations and barriers specifically related to their oncological disease. Running was a challenge with their cancer and a hope to give to other patients. Main barriers were represented by treatment-related side effects, inexperienced trainers and external factors, e.g. delivery of incorrect information. Running program dedicated to oncological patients should consider intrinsic obstacles, related to cancer and its treatment, offering a personalized intervention performed by qualified trainers, together with a motivational approach able to improve participants adherence to an active lifestyle.","10.1371/journal.pone.0227846"

Genes present in neurons are also expressed in non-neuronal cell types such as glia where they mediate non-targeted related functions. Thus, non-specific targeting of these proteins/channels has numerous unwanted side effects, as is the case with current small molecules or drug therapies. Current methodologies that use nanoparticles, lipid-mediated uptake, or mannitol in conjunction with lipids to deliver double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) have yielded mixed and unreliable results. We used a neuroanatomical tracer (B subunit of Cholera Toxin (CTB)) that binds to the ganglioside receptors (GM1) expressed on cells, including primary sensory neurons to deliver encapsulated dsRNA. This approach greatly improved delivery of dsRNA to the desired cells by enhancing uptake, reducing vehicle-mediated toxicity and protecting nucleotides from degradation by endonucleases. The delivery complex is internalized, and once inside the cell, the dsRNA naturally dissociates itself from the carrier complex and is very effective in knocking down cognate targets, both in vivo and in vitro. Past methods have used CTB-fusion proteins or chemically modified oligos or DNA moieties that have been covalently conjugated to CTB. Furthermore, CTB conjugated to an antigen, protein, or chemically modified nucleic acid is a potent activator of immune cell (T and B cells, macrophages) response, whereas CTB admixed with antigens or unmodified nucleic acids does not evoke this immune response. Importantly, in our method, the nucleic acids are not covalently linked to the carrier molecules. Thus, our method holds strong potential for targeted delivery of therapeutic moieties for cell types expressing GM1 receptors, including neuronal cell types.","NA"

Here we test the hypothesis that a unique and robust differentiated cell identity can result from a core component of the differentiated state doubling up such that it has key functions in the differentiated state and also works at low levels as a positive-feedback signaling mediator that drives progenitor cells to differentiate. Using live single-cell fluorescence imaging analysis in the adipocyte differentiation system, we show that FABP4, one of the most abundant core components that buffers lipids in differentiated adipocytes, regulates at low levels expression of PPARG, the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Adipocyte progenitor cells transition from a priming phase of differentiation to a second phase during which low levels of FABP4 and PPARG mutually reinforce each others expression. In this way both proteins reach a threshold where cells irreversibly commit to the differentiated state. Before and after reaching this threshold, PPARG transcriptionally increases FABP4 expression while fatty-acid loaded FABP4 binds to and increases PPARG activity. Together, our study suggests a control principle for robust cell identity, whereby a core component of the differentiated state also promotes differentiation from its own progenitor state.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIOnly a small fraction (~10%) of the maximally reached FABP4 levels in cells is needed to commit cells to the differentiated state.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, loss-of-functions of FAS1 or FAS2 subunits of the H3-H4 histone chaperone complex CHROMATIN ASSEMBLY FACTOR 1(CAF-1) has a dramatic effect on plant morphology, growth and overall fitness. Altered chromatin compaction, systematic loss of repetitive elements or increased DNA damage clearly demonstrate the severity of CAF-1 dysfunction. How histone chaperone molecular networks change without a functional CAF-1 remains elusive. Here we present an intriguing observation that disruption of the H2A-H2B histone chaperone NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN 1 (NAP1) supresses FAS1 loss-of function. The quadruple mutant fas1nap1;1-3 shows wild-type growth and decreased sensitivity to genotoxic stress. Chromatin of fas1nap1;1-3 plants is less accessible to micrococcal nuclease and progressive loss of telomeres and 45S rDNA is supressed. Interestingly, the strong genetic interaction between FAS1 and NAP1 does not occur via direct protein-protein interaction. We propose that NAP1;1-3 play an essential role in nucleosome assembly in fas1, thus their disruption abolishes fas1 defects. Our data altogether reveal a novel function of NAP1 proteins, unmasked by CAF-1 dysfunction. It emphasizes the importance of a balanced composition of chromatin and shed light on the histone chaperone molecular network.","NA"

The continually replicating adult tissue stem cells that control the integrity of many tissues of long-lived, multicellular, complex vertebrate organisms, including humans, constitute such a replicating system. Our suggestion is that somatic selection for mutations (or stable epigenetic changes) that cause an increased rate of adult tissue stem cell proliferation, and their long-term persistence, at the expense of normal differentiation, is a major key to the ageing process. Once an organism has passed the reproductive age, there is no longer any significant counterselection at the organismal level to this inevitable cellular level Darwinian process.

Here, we analyzed the effect of the knockdown and overexpression of ASCO at genome-wide level and found a high number of deregulated and differentially spliced genes, related to flagellin responses and biotic stress. In agreement, roots from ASCO-knocked down plants are more sensitive to flagellin. Surprisingly, only a minor subset of genes overlapped with the AS defects of the nsra/b double mutant. Using biotin-labelled oligonucleotides for RNA-mediated ribonucleoprotein purification, we found that ASCO binds to the highly conserved core spliceosome component PRP8a. ASCO deregulation impairs the recognition of specific flagellin-related transcripts by PRP8a and SmD1b, another spliceosome component, suggesting that ASCO function regulates AS through the interaction with multiple splicing factors. Hence, lncRNAs may interact in a dynamic network with many splicing factors to modulate transcriptome reprogramming in eukaryotes.","NA"

Using unsupervised learning, we resolve residues critical for signaling, including all major structural motifs and molecular interfaces. We also find a previously uncharacterized structural latch spanning the first two extracellular loops that is highly conserved across Class A GPCRs and is conformationally rigid in both the inactive and active states of the receptor.

Under pathological conditions, brain tumors disrupt glia-neuron communication signals that in consequence, promote tumor expansion at the expense of surrounding healthy tissue. The glioblastoma is the most aggressive and frequent brain tumor. This type of glioma expands and infiltrates into the brain, causing neuronal degeneration and neurological decay, among other symptoms. Here we describe how the glioblastoma produce ImpL2, an antagonist of the insulin pathway, which is regulated by the microRNA miR-8. ImpL2 targets neighboring neurons and causes mitochondrial disruption as well as synapse loss, both early symptoms of neurodegeneration. Furthermore, glioblastoma progression requires insulin pathway attenuation in neurons. Restoration of neuronal insulin activity is sufficient to rescue the synapse loss and to delay the premature death caused by glioma. Therefore, signals from GB to neuron emerge as a potential field of study to prevent neurodegeneration and to develop anti-tumoral strategies.

Significance StatementGlioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive type of brain tumour and currently there is no cure or effective treatment. Patients course with neurological decay and previous data in animal models indicate that GB cause a neurodegenerative process. We describe here a molecule named ImpL2 that is produced by GB cells and impact on neighbouring neurons. ImpL2 is an antagonist of the insulin pathway and signaling reduction in neurons causes mitochondrial defects and synapse loss. These mechanisms underlying GB-induced neurodegeneration plays a central role in the premature death caused by this tumour. Restoration of insulin signaling in neurons prevents tumour progression and rescues the lethality caused by GB in Drosophila models.","NA"

Methods and ResultsTo determine whether hypercholesterolemia accelerates the initiation of AAAs, male low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor -/- mice were either fed one week of Western diet prior to starting AngII infusion or initiated Western diet one week after starting AngII infusion. During the first week of AngII infusion, mice fed normal diet had less luminal expansion of the suprarenal aorta compared to those initiated Western diet after the first week of AngII infusion. The two groups achieved comparable luminal dilation on week 2 through week 6 of AngII infusion as monitored by ultrasound. To determine whether hypercholesterolemia contributed to the progression of established AAAs, male LDL receptor -/- mice were fed Western diet and infused with AngII for 4 weeks. Mice with established AAAs were then stratified into two groups based on luminal diameters measured by ultrasound. While AngII infusion was continued for another 8 weeks in both groups, mice in one group were continuously fed Western diet, but diet in the other group was switched to normal laboratory diet. In the latter group, plasma cholesterol concentrations were reduced rapidly to approximately 500 mg/dl within one week after the diet was switched from Western diet to normal laboratory diet. Luminal expansion progressed constantly in mice continuously fed Western diet, whereas no continuous expansion was detected in mice that were switched to normal laboratory diet.

ConclusionsHypercholesterolemia accelerates both the initiation of AAAs and progression of established AAAs in AngII-infused male LDL receptor -/- mice.

Clinical RelevanceHypercholesterolemia is modestly associated with AAAs in observational or retrospective clinical studies. It is not feasible to study whether hypercholesterolemia contributes to the initiation of AAAs or progression of established AAAs in human. This study using AngII-induced AAA mouse model provides solid evidence that hypercholesterolemia contributes to both the initiation and progression of AAAs, supporting that statin therapy at any stage of AAA development may be beneficial to hypercholesterolemic patients with AAAs.","NA"

Based on the simulation results, we anticipate several specific effects that may be observed in practice. First, the presence of non-binding conformers of the receptor molecule leads to a remarkable broadening in the binding transition even if the exchange between binding and non-binding conformers is very slow. Second, the ligand-binding mechanisms involving induced fit are expected to demonstrate deceptively decelerated exchange regimes even when the underlying kinetics are very fast.

Ric-8A adopts an armadillo (ARM)/HEAT repeat domain architecture and is structurally unrelated to G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCR)4. Both GEF and chaperone activities are stimulated by Casein Kinase II phosphorylation5. The mechanisms by which Ric-8A catalyzes GDP release and GTP binding to G, or exerts chaperone activity are unknown. Here, we report the structure of the nanobody-stabilized complex of nucleotide-free Gi1 (isoform 1 of G family i) and phosphorylated Ric-8A at near atomic resolution by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. We find that Ric-8A envelops the GTPase domain of G, disrupting all three switch regions that convey G nucleotide-binding and signaling activity, and displaces the C-terminal helix and helical domain of G. These cooperative interactions dismantle the GDP binding site and promote GDP release, while protecting structural elements of G that are dynamic in the nucleotide-free state. The structures also show how in vivo phosphorylation stabilizes G-binding elements of Ric-8A, thereby enhancing its GEF and chaperone activities.","NA"

Through proteomics screens, we find that the TCR-specific CSB protein loads the evolutionary conserved PAF1 complex (PAF1C) onto RNAPII in promoter-proximal regions in response to DNA damage. PAF1C is dispensable for TCR-mediated repair, but is essential for recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation, suggesting an uncoupling between DNA repair and transcription recovery.

TfR-eRUSH monoclonal cells expressing endogenous, ER-retainable and fluorescent TfR were engineered and characterized. Spatiotemporal quantitative proteomics of TfR-eRUSH cells allowed the identification of molecular partners associated with TfR-containing membranes and provided a comprehensive list of potential regulators, co-trafficking cargos, and enriched pathways. Furthermore, we chose to focus our attention on the Rab GTPase family members for their function as vesicle trafficking regulators and performed a Rab-targeted siRNA screen that we correlated to our proteomics data. Unexpectedly, we identified Rab7-harboring vesicles as an intermediate compartment of the Golgi-to-PM transport of the neosynthetic TfR. These vesicles did not exhibit degradative properties and were not associated to Rab6A-harboring vesicles, also involved in Golgi-to-PM transport. However, Rab6A-TfR vesicles delivered TfR directly to the PM, while in contrast, Rab7A was transiently associated to neosynthetic TfR-containing post-Golgi vesicles but dissociated before PM vesicle fusion.

To further annotate the genetic diversity in the species, 40 male, female, and monoecious cannabis and hemp varietals were evaluated for copy number variation (CNV) and RNA expression. This identified multiple CNVs governing cannabinoid expression and 82 genes associated with resistance to Golovinomyces chicoracearum, the causal agent of powdery mildew in cannabis. Results indicated that breeding for plants with low tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) concentrations may result in deletion of pathogen resistance genes. Low THCA cultivars also have a polymorphism every 51 bases while dispensary grade high THCA cannabis exhibited a variant every 73 bases.

L.","Alex L Jordan","Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior","2020-01-05",2,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","animal behavior and cognition","In many species, cultures, and contexts, social dominance reflects the ability to exert influence over others, and the question of what makes an effective leader is pertinent to a range of disciplines and contexts. While dominant individuals are often assumed to be most influential, the behavioral traits that make them dominant may also make them socially aversive and thereby reduce their influence. Here we examine the influence of dominant and subordinate males on group behavior in different social contexts using the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. We find that phenotypically dominant males display behavioral traits that typify leadership across taxonomic systems - aggressive, social centrality, and movement leadership, while subordinate males are passive, socially peripheral, and have little influence over movement. However, in a more complex group-consensus task involving visual cue associations, subordinate males become the most effective agents of social change. We find that dominant males are spatially distant and have lower signal-to-noise ratios of informative behavior in the association task, potentially interfering with their ability to generate group-consensus. In contrast, subordinate males are physically close to other group members, have high signal-to-noise behaviors in the association task, and visual connectivity to other group members equal to that of dominant males. The attributes that define effective social influence are therefore highly context-specific, with socially and phenotypically dominant males being influential in routine but not complex social scenarios. These results demonstrate that behavioral traits that are typical of socially dominant individuals may actually reduce their social influence in other contexts.

Significance StatementThe attributes that allow individuals to attain positions of social power and dominance are common across many vertebrate social systems - aggression, intimidation, coercion. Yet these traits are socially aversive, and can make dominant individuals poor agents of social change. In a vertebrate system (social cichlid fish) we show that dominant males are aggressive, socially central, and lead group movement. Yet dominant males are poor effectors of consensus in an more sophisticated association task compared with passive, socially-peripheral subordinate males. The most effective agents of social influence possess behavioral traits opposite of those typically found in position of social dominance, suggesting the behavioral processes that generate social dominance may simultaneously place the most ineffective leaders in positions of power.","NA"

Potentially abnormal values or features may yield essential information to support analysis of controls and patients cohorts, but subtle confounds affecting diffusion MRI, such as those due to difference in scanning protocols or hardware, can lead to systematic errors which could be mistaken for purely biologically driven variations amongst subjects. In this work, we propose a new harmonization algorithm based on adaptive dictionary learning to mitigate the unwanted variability caused by different scanner hardware while preserving the natural biological variability present in the data. Our new harmonization algorithm does not require paired training datasets nor spatial registration of the subjects to a common space, but instead is applied directly in the native space of each diffusion weighted images. Overcomplete dictionaries are learned iteratively from all datasets at the same time with an adaptive regularization criterion and are subsequently used to reconstruct the data, removing variability attributable to the scanners in the process. We use the publicly available database from an international challenge to evaluate the method, which was acquired on three different scanners and with two different protocols, and propose a new mapping towards a scanner-agnostic space. Results show that the effect size of the four studied diffusion metrics is preserved while removing variability attributable to the scanner. Experiments with alterations using a free water compartment, which is not simulated in the training data, shows that the modifications applied to the diffusion weighted images are preserved in the diffusion metrics after harmonization, while still reducing global variability at the same time. The algorithm is freely available and could help multicenter studies in pooling their data, while removing scanner specific confounds, and increase statistical power in the process.","NA"

The two-way interplay between local interactions and population dynamics is well understood in the relatively simple case where the population occupies a fixed domain with a uniform average density. However, the situation where the average population density is spatially varying is less well understood. This situation includes ecologically important scenarios such as species invasions, range shifts, and moving population fronts. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the spatial stochastic logistic model in a scenario where an initially confined population subsequently invades new, previously unoccupied territory. This simple model combines density-independent proliferation with dispersal, and density-dependent mortality via competition with other members of the population. We show that, depending on the spatial scales of dispersal and competition, either a clustered or a regular spatial structure develops over time within the invading population. In the short-range dispersal case, the invasion speed is significantly lower than standard predictions of the mean-field model. We conclude that mean-field models, even when they account for non-local processes such as dispersal and competition, can give misleading predictions for the speed of a moving invasion front.","10.1007/s12080-020-00450-1"

In this paper we develop a framework for controlling the architecture of stem cell populations in cell culture using high-throughput single cell mRNA-seq and computational analysis. We find that the transcriptional diversity of neural stem cell populations collapses in cell culture. Cell populations are depleted of committed neuron progenitor cells and become dominated by a single pre-astrocytic cell population. By analyzing the response of neural stem cell populations to forty distinct signaling conditions, we demonstrate that signaling environments can restructure cell populations by modulating the relative abundance of pre-astrocyte and pre-neuron subpopulations according to a simple linear code. One specific combination of BMP4, EGF, and FGF2 ligands switches the default population balance such that 70% of cells correspond to the committed neurons. Our work demonstrates that single-cell RNA-seq can be applied to modulate the diversity of in vitro stem cell populations providing a new strategy for population-level stem cell control.

However, there are several unresolved questions concerning the fundamental aspects of this theory. For example, is the functional dissociation between ventral and dorsal stream driven by features in input stimuli or is it driven by categorical differences between visuo-perceptual and visuo-motor functions? Is the dual stream rigid or flexible? What is the nature of the interactions between two streams? We addressed these questions using fMRI recordings on healthy human volunteers and employing stimuli and tasks that can tease out the divergence between visuo-perceptual and visuo-motor models of dual stream theory. fMRI scans were repeated after seven practice sessions that were conducted in a non-MRI environment to investigate the effects of neuroplasticity. Brain activation analysis supports an input-based functional dissociation and existence of context-dependent neuroplasticity in dual stream areas. Intriguingly, premotor cortex activation was observed in the position perception task and distributed deactivated regions were observed in all perception tasks thus, warranting a network level analysis. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) analysis incorporating activated and deactivated brain areas during perception tasks indicates that the brain dynamics during visual perception and actions could be interpreted within the framework of predictive coding. Effectively, the network level findings point towards the existence of more intricate context-driven functional networks selective of ""what"" and ""where"" information rather than segregated streams of processing along ventral and dorsal brain regions.","10.1162/jocn_a_01527"

Though voltage sensitivity plays an important role is shaping pain responses, how voltage regulates TRPV1 activation remains unknown. Here we showed that the voltage sensitivity of TRPV1 does not originate from the S4 segment like classic voltage-gated ion channels; instead, outer pore acidic residues directly partake in voltage-sensitive activation, with their negative charges collectively constituting the observed gating charges. Voltage-sensitive outer pore movement is titratable by extracellular pH and is allosterically coupled to channel activation, likely by influencing the upper gate in the ion selectivity filter.

However, little is known about what aspects of care patients would prioritize when presented with choices of desirable attributes and whether these patient priorities differ based on certain demographics.

ObjectiveTo assess patients priorities for a range of attributes in ambulatory care consultations across five key health service delivery domains and determine potential associations between patient priorities and certain demographic profiles.

MethodsUsing a What Matters to You survey patients ranked in order of importance various choices related to five health service domains (patient-physician relationship, personal responsibility, tests/procedures, medications and cost). Subjects were selected from two Johns Hopkins affiliated primary care clinics and a third gastroenterology subspecialty clinic over a period of 11 months. We calculated the percentage of respondents who selected each quality as their top 1-3 choice. Univariate and multivariate analyses determined demographic characteristics associated with patient priorities.

ResultsHumanistic qualities of physicians, leading a healthy lifestyle, shared decision making (SDM) for medications and tests/procedures and knowledge about insurance coverage were the most frequently ranked choices. Privately insured and more educated patients were less likely to rank humanistic qualities highly. Those with younger age, higher educational attainment and private insurance had higher odds of ranking healthy lifestyle as a top choice. Those with more education had higher odds of ranking SDM as a top choice.

ConclusionsIdentifying what matters most to patients is useful as we move towards patient-centered and value based care models. Our findings suggest that patients have priorities on qualities they value across key health service domains. Multiple factors including patient demographics can be predictors of these priorities. Elucidating these preferences is a challenging but a valuable step in the right direction.","NA"

The binarization process innovatively uses a measure to construct a binary rooted tree T consistent with the maximum number of input triplets. Then T is expanded in an intellectual process by adding minimum number of edges to obtain final network with the minimum number of reticulation nodes. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, NetCombin is compared with four state of the art algorithms, RPNCH, NCHB, TripNet, and SIMPLISTIC. The experimental results on real data indicate that by considering the trade-off between speed and precision, the NetCombin outperforms the others.

J.","Matthew J Miller","Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History","2020-01-06",1,"cc_by_nc","new results","genomics","BackgroundWoodpeckers are found in nearly every part of the world, absent only from Antarctica, Australasia, and Madagascar. Woodpeckers have been important for studies of biogeography, phylogeography, and macroecology. Woodpeckers hybrid zones are often studied to understand the dynamics of introgression between bird species. Notably, woodpeckers are gaining attention for their enriched levels of transposable elements (TEs) relative to most other birds. This enrichment of TEs may have substantial effects on woodpecker molecular evolution. The Golden-fronted Woodpecker (Melanerpes aurifrons) is a member of the largest radiation of New World woodpeckers. However, comparative studies of woodpecker genomes are hindered by the fact that no high-contiguity genome exists for any woodpecker species.

FindingsUsing hybrid assembly methods that combine long-read Oxford Nanopore and short-read Illumina sequencing data, we generated a highly contiguous genome assembly for the Golden-fronted Woodpecker. The final assembly is 1.31 Gb and comprises 441 contigs plus a full mitochondrial genome. Half of the assembly is represented by 28 contigs (contig N50), each of these contigs is at least 16 Mb in size (contig L50). High recovery (92.6%) of bird-specific BUSCO genes suggests our assembly is both relatively complete and relatively accurate. Accuracy is also demonstrated by the recovery of a putatively error-free mitochondrial genome. Over a quarter (25.8%) of the genome consists of repetitive elements, with 287 Mb (21.9%) of those elements assignable to the CR1 superfamily of transposable elements, the highest proportion of CR1 repeats reported for any bird genome to date.

ConclusionOur assembly provides a useful tool for comparative studies of molecular evolution and genomics in woodpeckers and allies, a group emerging as important for studies on the role that TEs may play in avian evolution. Additionally, the sequencing and bioinformatic resources used to generate this assembly were relatively low-cost and should provide a direction for the development of high-quality genomes for future studies of animal biodiversity.","NA"

Our results show that young normal-hearing (NH) and older hearing-impaired (HI) individuals rely on a comparable non-linear processing architecture involving non-directional band-pass modulation filtering. We demonstrate that a temporal-modulation filter-bank model can capture the strategy of the NH group and that a broader tuning of cochlear filters is sufficient to explain the overall shift toward temporal modulations of the HI group. Yet, idiosyncratic behaviors exposed within each group highlight the contribution and the need to consider additional mechanisms. This integrated experimental-computational approach offers a principled way to assess supra-threshold auditory processing distortions of each individual.","NA"

The investigation of these interactions poses a significant challenge - in part due to the lack of suitable experimental tools. We present the Microwell Recovery Array, a high throughput approach designed to rapidly screen interactions across a microbiome and uncover higher-order combinations of strains that either inhibit or promote the function of a GFP-producing focal species. One experiment generates 104 unique microbial communities that contain a focal species combined with a unique combination of previously uncharacterized cells from plant rhizosphere. Cells are then sequentially extracted from individual co-culture wells that display highest or lowest levels of focal species function using a novel high-resolution photopolymer extraction system. Microbes present are subsequently identified and the putative interactions are validated. Using this approach, we screen the Populus trichocarpa rhizosphere for bacterial strains affecting the survival and growth of Pantoea sp. YR343, a plant growth promoting strain isolated from the P. trichocarpa rhizosphere. We were able to simultaneously isolate and validate multiple Stenotrophomonas strains that antagonize strain YR343 growth and a set of Enterobacter strains that promote strain YR343 growth. The latter demonstrates the unique ability of the platform to uncover multi-membered consortia that generate emergent phenotypes. This knowledge will inform the development of beneficial consortia that promote the production of Populus biofuel feedstock, while the platform is adaptable to screening higher-order interactions in any microbiome of interest.

Significance StatementAchieving a fundamental understanding of microbe-microbe interactions that occur within microbial communities is a grand challenge in microbiology due to the limited experimental tools available. In this report, we describe a new tool that enables one to screen microbial interactions across thousands of compositionally unique communities to discover collections of bacteria that antagonize or promote the survival and growth of bacteria with important functions. This approach has the unique ability to uncover higher-order combinations of bacteria that generate emergent phenotypes, information useful for development of biofertilizer, biocontrol, or probiotic consortia, as well as in the design of communities for biosynthetic compound production.","NA"

Comparative study of entire genome architecture in model organisms is shedding light on mechanisms underlying genome regulation, evolution, and diversification; but such studies require costly analytical approaches which make extensive comparative study impractical for most groups. However, lower-cost methods that measure a single architectural component (e.g., distribution of one class of repeats) have potential as a new data source for evolutionary studies insofar as that measure correlates with more complex biological phenomena, and for which it could serve as part of an explanatory framework. We investigated copy number variation (CNV) profiles in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) as a simple measure reflecting the distribution of rDNA subcomponents across the genome. We find that signatures present in rDNA CNV profiles strongly correlate with species boundaries in the breve species group of Bembidion, and vary across broader taxonomic sampling in Bembidion subgenus Plataphus. Profiles of several species show evidence of re-patterning of rDNA-like sequences throughout the genome, revealing evidence of rapid genome evolution (including among sister pairs) not evident from analysis of traditional data sources such as multi-gene data sets. Major re-patterning of rDNA-like sequences has occurred frequently within the evolutionary history of Plataphus. We confirm that CNV profiles represent an aspect of genomic architecture (i.e., the linear distribution of rDNA components across the genome) via fluorescence in-situ hybridization. In at least one species, novel rDNA-like elements are spread throughout all chromosomes. We discuss the potential of copy number profiles of rDNA, or other repeats, as a low-cost tool for incorporating signal of genomic architecture variation in studies of species delimitation and genome evolution.","10.1093/sysbio/syaa030"

Genome sequencing revealed four genes (fnr1, fnr3, fnr5 and fnr7) coding for Fnr proteins in Paenibacillus polymyxa WLY78. Fnr1 and Fnr3 showed more similarity to each other than to Fnr5 and Fnr7. Also, Fnr1 and Fnr3 exhibited high similarity with Bacillus cereus Fnr and Bacillus subtilis Fnr in sequence and structures. Deletion analysis showed that the four fnr genes, especially fnr1 and fnr3, have significant impacts on the growth and nitrogenase activity. Single deletion of fnr1 or fnr3 led to 50% reduction in nitrogenase activity and double deletion of fnr1 and fnr3 resulted to 90% reduction in activity. Both of the aerobically purified His-tagged Fnr1 and His-tagged Fnr3 in Escherichia coli could bind to the specific DNA promoter. Genome-wide transcription analysis showed that Fnr1 and Fnr3 indirectly activated expression of nif (nitrogen fixation) genes and Fe transport genes under anaerobic condition. Fnr1 and Fnr3 inhibited expression of the genes involved in aerobic respiratory chain and activated expression of genes responsible for anaerobic electron acceptor genes.

IMPORTANCEPaenibacillus is a genus of Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic and endospore-forming bacteria. The members of nitrogen-fixing Paenibacillus have great potential use as a bacterial fertilizer in agriculture. However, the functions of fnr gene(s) in nitrogen fixation and other metabolisms in Paenibacillus spp. are not known. Here, we revealed that copy numbers vary largely among different Paenibacillus species and strains. Deletion and complementation analysis demonstrated that fnr1 and fnr3 have significant impacts on the growth and nitrogenase activity. Both of the aerobically purified His-tagged Fnr1 and His-tagged Fnr3 purified in Escherichia coli could bind to the specific DNA promoter as Bacillus cereus Fnr did. Fnr1 and Fnr3 indirectly activated nif expression under anaerobic condition. Fnr1 and Fnr3 directly or indirectly activated or inhibited expression of many important genes involved in respiration, energy metabolism, Fe uptake and potentially specific electron transport for nitrogenase under anaerobic condition. This study not only reveals the roles of fnr genes in nitrogen fixation and anaerobic metabolism, but also provides insight into the evolution and regulatory mechanisms of fnr in Paenibacillus.","10.1128/AEM.03012-19"

Here, we report that TSP-4 mediates breast cancer inflammation and growth in mouse models in response to hyperglycemia and TGF-beta by increasing TAM infiltration and production of inflammatory signals in tumors. Analysis of breast cancers and non-cancerous tissue specimens from hyperglycemic patients revealed that levels of TSP-4, macrophage marker CD68, and TGF-beta signaling are upregulated in diabetic tissues. TSP-4 was co-localized with macrophages in cancer tissues. Bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) responded to high glucose by upregulating TGF-beta signaling and TSP-4 production and expression, as well as the expression of inflammatory markers.

This study was conducted along a 3.22 km stretch of the LRGR in southwestern Webb County, TX to assess bee (Anthophila) communities and their flowering-plant resources among proximal and distal terrestrial upland and river-adjacent sub-corridors. Patterns related to the bee community across the two habitats consisted of low variation and dominance by common taxa, suggesting the riparian corridor could be used as a resource for bee foraging and soil-nesting.

In the second application, the algorithm was applied to construct a three dimensional centerline through single photon emission computed tomography images of the colon arising from the study of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV. The centerline in this application is crucial for understanding the distribution of the antiviral agents in the colon for HIV prevention.

We found homeostatic changes in hyperexcitable networks, expressed as an early onset lengthening of active zones at inhibitory synapses followed by spatial reorganization of recycled vesicles at excitatory synapses.

Aside from causing increased variability in clinical response, it is possible that the major ADD comorbidities may not respond to ADD-specific molecular therapeutics. As most reports have focused on comorbidity in the oldest-old, its extent in younger age groups that are more likely to be involved in clinical trials is largely unknown. We conducted a survey of neuropathological comorbidities in sporadic ADD using data from the US National Alzheimers Coordinating Center. Subject data was restricted to those with dementia and meeting National Institute on Aging-Alzheimers Association (NIA-AA) intermediate or high AD Neuropathological Change (ADNC) levels, excluding those with known autosomal dominant AD-related mutations. Subjects were divided into age-at-death categories for analysis: under 60, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90-99 and 100 or over. Confirmatory of earlier reports, ADD histopathology is less severe with advancing age, effectively increasing the relative contribution of comorbidities, most of which rise in prevalence with age. Highly prevalent ADD comorbidities are not restricted to the oldest-old but are common even in early-onset ADD. The percentage of cases with ADD as the sole major neuropathological diagnosis is highest in the under-60 group, where ""pure"" ADD cases are still in the minority at 44%. After this AD as a sole major pathology in ADD declines to roughly 20% in the 70s and beyond. Comorbidity rates for some pathologies, especially LBD, are high even in subjects in their 60s and 70s, at nearly 60%, but for most others, their prevalence increases with age. TDP-43 pathology affects more than 35% of ADD subjects 80 and over while microscopic infarcts reach this rate a decade later. Gross infarcts rise more slowly and affect fewer subjects but still involve 15-20% of ADD after age 80. White matter rarefaction may be underestimated in the NACC database but is present in almost 70% of centenarians with ADD. Effective clinical trials depend on accurate estimates of required subject numbers, which are dependent on observed effect size and clinical response variability. Comorbidities are likely to affect both, leading to lower probability of clinical trial success. Stratifying ADD clinical trial analyses by presence and types of accompanying comorbidities might identify subgroups with higher effect sizes and greater clinical response rates, but accurate in-vivo diagnostic methods for most comorbidities are still lacking.","NA"

We make 56 targeted point mutations to individual interactions of Ran/Gsp1 and show through quantitative, systematic genetic and physical interaction mapping that Ran/Gsp1 interface perturbations have widespread cellular consequences that cluster by biological processes but, unexpectedly, not by the targeted interactions. Instead, the cellular consequences of the interface mutations group by their biophysical effects on kinetic parameters of the GTPase switch cycle, and cycle kinetics are allosterically tuned by distal interface mutations. We propose that the functional multi-specificity of Ran/Gsp1 is encoded by a differential sensitivity of biological processes to different kinetic parameters of the Gsp1 switch cycle, and that Gsp1 partners binding to the sites of distal mutations act as allosteric regulators of the switch. Similar mechanisms may underlie biological regulation by other GTPases and biological switches. Finally, our integrative platform to determine the quantitative consequences of cellular perturbations may help explain the effects of disease mutations targeting central switches.","NA"

Currently, procedures require a significant amount of skill, have a high failure rate, and take up a significant amount of time.

We developed a next generation robotic stereotaxic platform for small rodents by combining a three-dimensional (3D) skull profiler sub-system and a full six degree-of-freedom (6DOF) robotic platform. The 3D skull profiler is based on structured illumination in which a series of horizontal and vertical line patterns are projected onto an animal skull. These patterns are captured by two two-dimensional (2D) CCD cameras which reconstruct an accurate 3D skull surface based on structured illumination and geometrical triangulation. Using the reconstructed 3D profile, the skull can repositioned using a 6DOF robotic platform to accurately align a surgical tool. The system was evaluated using mechanical measurement techniques, and the accuracy of the platform was demonstrated using brain phantoms. Additionally, small and deep brain nuclei were targeted in rodents for additional testing.

While the effect of matrix stiffness has been and is still extensively studied, few studies have focused on the role of mechanical stresses. The main limitation of such analyses is the lack of standard in vitro assays enabling extended mechanical stimulation compatible with dynamic biological and biophysical cell characterization. We have developed an agarose-based microsystem, the soft cell confiner, which enables the precise control of confinement for single or mixed cell populations. The rigidity of the confiner matches physiological conditions and enables passive medium renewal. It is compatible with time-lapse microscopy, in situ immunostaining, and standard molecular analyses, and can be used with both adherent and non-adherent cell lines. Cell proliferation of various cell lines (hematopoietic cells, MCF10A epithelial breast cells and HS27A stromal cells) was followed for several days up to confluence using video-microscopy and further documented by Western blot and immunostaining. Interestingly, even though the nuclear projected area was much larger upon confinement, with many highly deformed nuclei (non-circular shape), cell viability, assessed by live and dead cell staining, was unaffected for up to 8 days in the confiner. However, there was a decrease in cell proliferation upon confinement for all tested cell lines. The soft cell confiner is thus a valuable tool to decipher the effect of long-term confinement and deformation on the biology of cell populations. This tool will be instrumental in deciphering the impact of nuclear and cytoskeletal mechanosensitivity in normal and pathological conditions involving highly confined situations, such as those reported upon aging with fibrosis or during cancer.

R.; Postle, K.","Kathleen Postle","Penn State University","2020-01-06",1,"cc_no","new results","microbiology","The TonB system energizes transport of essential nutrients, such as iron siderophores, across unenergized outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. The integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins of the TonB system--ExbB, ExbD, and TonB--transduce the protonmotive force of the cytoplasmic membrane to TonB-dependent outer membrane transporters for active transport. ExbD protein is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane, with the majority of it occupying the periplasm. We previously identified a conserved motif within a periplasmic disordered domain that is essential for TonB system function. Here we demonstrated that export of a peptide derived from that motif into the periplasm prevented TonB system function and inhibited all known ExbD interactions in vivo. Formaldehyde crosslinking captured the ExbD peptide in multiple ExbD and TonB complexes. Furthermore, peptides with mutations in the conserved motif not only had significantly reduced ability to inhibit TonB system activity, but they also altered interactions with ExbD and TonB, indicating the specificity of the interaction. Conserved motif peptide interactions with ExbD and TonB mostly occurred between Stage II and Stage III of the TonB energy transduction cycle, a transition that is characterized by the use of protonmotive force. Taken together, the data suggest that the ExbD disordered domain motif has multiple interactions with TonB and ExbD during between Stage II and III of the TonB energization cycle. Because of the essentiality of the motif, it may be a potential template for design of novel antibiotics that target the TonB system.

IMPORTANCEGram-negative bacteria are intrinsically antibiotic-resistant due to the diffusion barrier posed by their outer membranes. The TonB system allows them to circumvent this barrier for their own nutritional needs, including iron. The ability of bacteria to acquire iron is a virulence factor for many Gram-negative pathogens. However, no antibiotics currently target the TonB system. Because TonB and ExbD must interact productively in the periplasm for transport across the outer membrane, they constitute attractive targets for potential antibiotic development where chemical characteristics need not accommodate the need to cross the hydrophobic cytoplasmic membrane. Here we show that a small ExbD-derived peptide can interfere with the TonB-ExbD interaction to inhibit the TonB system in vivo.","NA"

The production of HCN was examined in 78 cyanobacteria strains from all five principal sections of cyanobacteria, both non-heterocytous and heterocytous, representing a variety of lifestyles and habitats. Twenty-eight (28) strains were found positive for HCN production, with universal representation amongst 22 cyanobacterial planktic and epilithic genera inhabiting freshwater, brackish, marine (including sponges), and terrestrial (including anchialine) habitats. The HCN production could be linked with nitrogen fixation, as all of HCN producing strains are considered capable of fixing nitrogen. Epilithic lifestyle, where cyanobacteria are more vulnerable to a number of grazers and accumulate more glycine, had the largest percentage (75%) of HCN-producing cyanobacteria compared to strains from aquatic ecosystems.

While many brain regions are involved in AUD etiology, proper function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is particularly important for top-down craving management and the moderation of drinking behaviors. Essential regulation of PFC output is provided by local inhibitory interneurons, yet the effects of chronic drinking on interneuron physiology remain poorly understood, particularly in female individuals. To address this gap, we generated fluorescent reporter transgenic mice to label the two major classes of interneuron in deep layer prelimbic PFC, based on expression of parvalbumin (PV-IN) or somatostatin (SST-IN). We then interrogated PV-IN and SST-IN membrane and synaptic physiology in a rodent model of binge drinking. Beginning in late adolescence, mice received 3-4 weeks of intermittent access (IA) ethanol. One day after the last drinking session, adaptations to PV-IN and SST-IN intrinsic physiology were observed in male mice but not in female mice. Furthermore, IA ethanol precipitated diametrically opposing changes to PV-IN synaptic physiology based on sex. IA ethanol decreased excitatory synaptic strength onto PV-INs from female mice and potentiated excitatory transmission onto PV-INs male mice. In contrast, decreased synaptic strength onto SST-INs was observed following IA ethanol in all groups of mice. Together, these findings illustrate novel sex differences in drinking-related PFC pathophysiology. Discovering means to restore PV-IN and SST-IN dysfunction following extended drinking provides opportunities for developing new treatments for all AUD patients.","NA"

W.","Michael W Bevan","John Innes Centre","2020-01-06",1,"cc_no","new results","plant biology","BackgroundThe same species of plant can exhibit highly diverse sizes and shapes of organs that are genetically determined. Defining genetic variation underlying this morphological diversity is an important objective in evolutionary studies and it also helps identify the functions of genes influencing plant growth and development. Extensive screens of mutagenised Arabidopsis populations have identified multiple genes and mechanisms affecting organ size and shape, but relatively few studies have exploited the rich diversity of natural populations to identify genes involved in growth control.

ResultsWe screened a relatively well characterised collection of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes for variation in petal size. Association analyses identified sequence and gene expression variation on chromosome 4 that made a substantial contribution to differences in petal area. Variation in expression of At4g16850 (named as KSK), encoding a hypothetical protein, had a substantial role on variation in organ size by influencing cell size. Over-expression of KSK led to larger petals with larger cells and promoted the formation of stamenoid features. The expression of auxin-responsive genes known to limit cell growth was reduced in response to KSK over-expression. ANT expression was also reduced in KSK over-expression lines, consistent with altered floral identities. Auxin availability was reduced in KSK over-expressing cells, consistent with changes in auxin-responsive gene expression. KSK may therefore influence auxin availability during petal development.

ConclusionsUnderstanding how genetic variation influences plant growth is important for both evolutionary and mechanistic studies. We used natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana to identify sequence variation in a promoter region of Arabidopsis ecotypes that mediated differences in the expression of a previously uncharacterised membrane protein. This variation contributed to altered auxin availability and cell size during petal growth.","NA"

Such antibodies provide protection against reinfection by the same strain of a pathogen. A highly mutable virus, like HIV or influenza, evades recognition by these strain-specific antibodies via the emergence of new mutant strains. A vaccine that elicits antibodies that can bind to many diverse strains of the virus - known as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) - could protect against highly mutable pathogens. Despite much work, the mechanisms by which bnAbs emerge remain uncertain. Using a computational model of affinity maturation, we studied a wide variety of vaccination strategies. Our results suggest that an effective strategy to maximize bnAb evolution is through a sequential immunization protocol, wherein each new immunization optimally increases the pressure on the immune system to target conserved antigenic sites, thus conferring breadth. We describe the mechanisms underlying why sequentially driving the immune system increasingly further from equilibrium, in an optimal fashion, is effective. The optimal protocol allows many evolving B cells to become bnAbs via diverse evolutionary paths.

Significance StatementThe global health burden could be substantially alleviated by the creation of universal vaccines against highly mutable pathogens like HIV and influenza. Broadly-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are encouraging targets for such vaccines, because they can bind to diverse strains of highly mutable pathogens. BnAbs typically develop only rarely upon natural infection, after the immune system has been exposed to many mutated versions of a pathogen. Thus, sequentially administering multiple different pathogen-like proteins (antigens) is a promising strategy to elicit bnAbs through vaccination. However, it remains unclear how best to design and administer these antigens. We explore this matter using physics-based simulations, and provide new mechanistic insights into antibody evolution that could guide the creation of universal vaccines against highly mutable pathogens.","NA"

Phylogeographic population genetic structure related to persistence in separate glacial refugia has been recently revealed in the S. nutans plant species complex across Western Europe, identifying several distinct lineages.

We found clear differentiation between fungal populations parasitizing S. nutans and S. italica plants. The population genetic structure of fungal strains parasitizing the S. nutans plant species complex mirrored the host plant genetic structure, suggesting that the pathogen was isolated in glacial refugia together with its host and/or that it has specialized on the plant genetic lineages. Using random forest approximate Bayesian computation (ABC-RF), we found that the divergence history of the fungal lineages on S. nutans was congruent with the one previously inferred for the host plant and likely occurred with ancient but no recent gene flow. Genome sequences confirmed the genetic structure and the absence of recent gene flow between fungal genetic lineages.

Cranial irradiation commonly leads to neurocognitive deficits that manifest months or years after treatment. Mechanistically, radiation-induced loss of neural stem/progenitor cells, neuro-inflammation and de-myelinization are contributing factors that lead to progressive cognitive decline.

MethodsThe effects of Compound #5 on irradiated murine neurospheres, microglia cells and patients-derived gliomaspheres were assessed in sphere-formation assays, flow cytometry and IL-6 ELISAs, Activation of the Hedgehog pathway was studied by qRT-PCR. The in vivo effects of Compound #5 were analyzed using flow cytometry, sphere-formation assays, immune-histochemistry, behavioral testing and an intracranial mouse model of glioblastoma.

ResultsWe report that 1-[(4-Nitrophenyl)sulfonyl]-4-phenylpiperazine (Compound #5) mitigates radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity in the brains of mice. Compound #5 treatment significantly increased the number of neural stem/progenitor cells after brain irradiation in female animals, inhibited radiation-induced microglia activation and expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6. Behavioral testing revealed that treatment with Compound #5 after radiotherapy successfully mitigates radiation-induced decline in motor, sensory and memory function of the brain. In mouse models of glioblastoma, Compound #5 showed no toxicity and did not interfere with the growth-delaying effects of radiation.

ConclusionsWe conclude that Compound #5 has the potential to mitigate cognitive decline in patients undergoing partial or whole brain irradiation without promoting tumor growth and that the use of this compound as a radiation mitigator of radiation late effects on the CNS warrants further investigation.

Importance of the StudySuccessful radiotherapy of CNS malignancies inevitably lead to cognitive decline in cancer survivors and treatment options to mitigate this side effect are limited. We present evidence that a piperazine compound can prevent cognitive decline in mice after total brain irradiation without compromising the antitumor effect of radiation, suggesting that this compound could be used to mitigate radiation side effects in brain tumor patients undergoing radiotherapy.","10.1093/neuonc/noaa095"

Because growth lags can be large compared to typical doubling times, variations in growth lag are an important but often overlooked component of bacterial fitness in fluctuating environments. We here explore how growth lag variation is determined for the archetypical switch from glucose to lactose as a carbon source in E. coli. First, we show that single-cell lags are bimodally distributed and controlled by a single-molecule trigger. That is, gene expression noise causes the population before the switch to divide into subpopulations with zero and nonzero lac operon expression. While  sensorless cells with zero pre-existing lac expression at the switch have long lags because they are unable to sense the lactose signal, any nonzero lac operon expression suffices to ensure a short lag. Second, we show that the growth lag at the population level depends crucially on the fraction of sensorless cells, and that this fraction in turn depends sensitively on the growth condition before the switch. Consequently, even small changes of basal expression affecting the fraction of sensorless cells can significantly affect population lags and fitness under switching conditions, and may thus be subject to significant natural selection. Indeed, we show that condition-dependent population lags vary across wild E. coli isolates. Since many sensory genes are naturally low expressed in conditions where their inducer is not present, bimodal responses due to subpopulations of sensorless cells may be a general mechanism inducing phenotypic heterogeneity and controlling population lags in switching environments. This mechanism also illustrates how gene expression noise can turn even simple sensory gene circuits into a bet-hedging module, and underlines the profound role of gene expression noise in regulatory responses.","NA"

Taxa richness (p < 0.1) and abundance (p < 0.05) in Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria were protectively associated with asthma, and these taxa were mainly derived from outdoor environment. Building age, floor and curtain cleaning frequency shaped the overall bacterial community of air dust (p < 0.05). Frequent curtain cleaning increased the relative abundance of 10 protective genera (p < 0.05), and old buildings had mix effects to protective genera (p < 0.05).

Our data shows that taxa from different phylogenetic classes and ecological niches have different health effects, indicating the importance of incorporating evolutionary and ecological concepts in revealing general patterns in the microbiome asthma association analysis.","NA"

Perturbations in the ubiquitin-proteasome (UPS) system also cause neurodegeneration5-10, and alter the dynamicity and kinetics of SGs11-14. Using single mRNA imaging in live cells15, 16, we took an unbiased approach to determine if defects in the UPS perturb mRNA translation and partitioning into SGs during acute stress. We observe ribosomes stall on mRNAs during arsenite stress, and the release of transcripts from stalled ribosomes for their partitioning into SGs requires the activities of valosin-containing protein (VCP) and the proteasome, which is in contrast to previous work showing VCP primarily affected SG disassembly 11, 13, 14, 17. Moreover, members of a specialized complex in the UPS that targets aberrant nascent proteins for decay upon ribosome stalling, referred to as ribosome-associated quality control complex (RQC)18, are also required for mRNA release from ribosomes and partitioning into SGs. VCP alleles that increase segregase activity and cause neurodegeneration and inclusion body myopathies5, 6, 19, 20 increase mRNA recruitment to SGs, suggesting aberrant mRNA localization to SGs in disease contexts.

Dicer-CKO mice demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in the hepatocyte-derived microRNA, miR-122, in the kidney in the absence of other microRNA changes.

The remarkable diversity of flowering plants (angiosperms) has been attributed, in part, to the tremendous variation in their chromosome number2. This variation has stimulated a blossoming number of speculations about the ancestral chromosome number of angiosperms2-7, but estimates so far remain equivocal and relied on algebraic approaches lacking an explicit phylogenetic framework. Here we used a probabilistic approach to model haploid chromosome number (n) changes8 along a phylogeny embracing more than 10 thousands taxa, to reconstruct the ancestral chromosome number of the common ancestor of extant angiosperms and the most recent common ancestor for single angiosperm families.

Bayesian inference revealed an ancestral haploid chromosome number for angiosperms n = 7, reinforcing previous hypotheses2-7 that suggested a low ancestral basic number. Inferred n for single families, more than half of which are provided here for the first time, are mostly congruent with previous evaluations. Chromosome fusion (loss) and duplication (polyploidy) are the predominant transition types inferred along the phylogenetic tree, emphasising the importance of both dysploidy6,9,10 and genome duplication2,7,11-13 in chromosome number evolution. Significantly, while dysploidy is equally distributed early and late across the whole phylogeny, polyploidy is detected mainly towards the tips of the tree. Therefore, little evidence exists for a link between ancestral chromosome numbers and putative ancient polyploidization events14, suggesting that further insights are needed to elucidate the organization of genome packaging into chromosomes.","NA"

In addition to tracking a changing climate, extant species must face complex, anthropogenically fragmented landscapes. The dominant conifer species in the mesic temperate forests of the Pacific Northwest are split by the arid rain-shadow of the Cascade Range into coastal and interior distributions, with continued debate over the origins of the interior populations. If the Last Glacial Maximum extirpated populations in the interior then postglacial migration across the arid divide would have been necessary to create the current distribution, whereas interior refugial persistence could have locally repopulated the disjunction. These alternative scenarios have significant implications for the postglacial development of the Pacific Northwest mesic forests and the impact of dispersal barriers during periods of climate change. Here we use genotyping-by-sequencing (ddRADseq) and phylogeographical modeling to show that the postglacial expansion of both mountain hemlock and western redcedar consisted largely of long-distance spread inland in the direction of dominant winds, with limited expansion from an interior redcedar refugium. Our results for these two key mesic conifers, along with fossil pollen data, address the longstanding question on the development of the Pacific Northwest mesic forests and contrast with many recent studies emphasizing the role of cryptic refugia in colonizing modern species ranges.

Statement of SignificanceUnderstanding whether habitat fragmentation hinders range shifts as species track a changing climate presents a pressing challenge for biologists. Species with disjunct distributions provide a natural laboratory for studying the effects of fragmentation during past periods of climate change. We find that dispersal across a 50-200-km inhospitable barrier characterized the expansion of two conifer species since the last ice age. The importance of migration, and minimal contribution of more local glacial refugia, contrasts with many recent studies emphasizing the role of microrefugia in populating modern species distributions. Our results address a longstanding question on the development of the disjunct mesic conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest and offer new insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of refugial populations and postglacial vegetation development previously unresolved despite decades of paleoecological studies.","NA"

Here, a system named iSCAPE was invented to efficiently sieve particles out from a mixture by employing an electrostatic field and a non-conductive mineral oil. Tests with atmospheric particles of different cities as well as soil and road dust samples demonstrated that the iSCAPEd particles under different operating conditions moved rapidly with different velocities and both directions. Particles of different sources such as ambient air, soil or road were shown to have different polarity-charged particle fractions, and exhibited clearly different particle electrical mobility graphs after the iSCAPE sieving from seconds to minutes. Data also revealed that after the sieving some particles were enriched at specific mobility ranges. Bacterial ATP measurements implied that the iSCAPE can be also used to efficiently separate bacteria of different sizes and charge polarity. Experimental data here suggest that the iSCAPE sieving strongly replies on the electrostatic field strength, mineral oil viscosity and the run time. In theory, the iSCAPE system can be used to extract any desired targets from a complex sample, thus opening up many outstanding opportunities for environmental, biomedical and life science fields.

However, existing base-editors can only induce transition substitutions in a specified region determined by the base editor, thus, they are incompatible for many point mutations. Here, we present BE-FF (Base Editors Functional Finder), a novel computational tool that identifies suitable base editors to correct the translated sequence erred by a given single nucleotide variation. Even if a perfect correction of the single nucleotide variation is not possible, BE-FF detects synonymous corrections to produce the reference protein. To assess the potential of BE-FF, we analysed a database of human pathogenic point mutations and found suitable base editors for 60.9% of the transition mutations. Importantly, 19.4% of them were made possible only by synonymous corrections. Moreover, we detected 298 cases in which pathogenic mutations caused by transversions were potentially repairable by base editing via synonymous corrections, although it had been thought impractical.

The canonical Wnt Tcf/Lef transcription factors regulate development and stemness, but the mechanisms by which injury-induced cues modulate their expression remain underexplored. Here, we studied the cell-specific gene expression of Tcf/Lef and, more specifically, we investigated whether damage-induced TGF-{beta} impairs the expression and function of TCF7L2, using several models of MSCs, including skeletal muscle fibro-adipogenic progenitors. We show that Tcf/Lefs are differentially expressed and that TGF-{beta} reduces the expression of TCF7L2 in MSCs but not in myoblasts. We also found that the ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates TCF7L2 proteostasis and participates in TGF-{beta}-mediated TCF7L2 protein downregulation. Finally, we show that TGF-{beta} requires HDACs activity to repress the expression of TCF7L2. Thus, our work found a novel interplay between TGF-{beta} and Wnt canonical signaling cascades in PDGFR+ fibroblasts and suggests that this mechanism could be targeted in tissue repa ir and regeneration.

Such coupling occurs independently of nucleosomes. Hemimethylated DNA preferentially stimulates ATPase activity, and mutating the Dnmt5 ATP binding pocket disproportionately reduces ATPase stimulation by hemimethylated versus unmethylated substrates. Engineered DNA substrates that stabilize a reaction intermediate by mimicking a  flipped-out conformation of the target cytosine bypass the SNF2 domains requirement for hemimethylation. This result implies that ATP hydrolysis by the SNF2 domain is coupled to base-flipping by the DNMT domain.

A subclass of riboswitches and RNA thermometers located in the 5 region of the primary transcript regulates the downstream functional unit - usually an ORF - through premature termination of transcription. Such elements not only occur naturally but they are also attractive devices in synthetic biology. The possibility to design such riboswitches or RNA thermometers is thus of considerable practical interest. Since these functional RNA elements act already during transcription, it is important to model and understand the dynamics of folding and, in particular, the formation of intermediate structures concurrently with transcription. Cotranscriptional folding simulations are therefore an important step to verify the functionality of design constructs before conducting expensive and labour-intensive wet lab experiments. For RNAs, full-fledged molecular dynamics simulations are far beyond practical reach both because of the size of the molecules and the time scales of interest. Even at the simplified level of secondary structures further approximations are necessary. The BarMap approach is based on representing the secondary structure landscape for each individual transcription step by a coarse-grained representation that only retains a small set of low-energy local minima and the energy barriers between them. The folding dynamics between two transcriptional elongation steps is modeled as a Markov process on this representation. Maps between pairs of consecutive coarse-grained landscapes make it possible to follow the folding process as it changes in response to transcription elongation.

In its original implementation, the BarMap software provides a general framework to investigate RNA folding dynamics on temporally changing landscapes. It is, however, difficult to use in particular for specific scenarios such as cotranscriptional folding. To overcome this limitation, we developed the user-friendly BarMap-QA pipeline described in detail in this contribution. It is illustrated here by an elaborate example that emphasizes the careful monitoring of several quality measures. Using an iterative workflow, a reliable and complete kinetics simulation of a synthetic, transcription regulating riboswitch is obtained using minimal computational resources.

Identifying the protein sequence features responsible for IDP phase separation is critical for understanding physiological roles and pathological consequences of biomolecular condensation, as well as for harnessing phase separation for applications in bio-inspired materials design. To expand our knowledge of sequence determinants of IDP phase separation, we characterized variants of the intrinsically disordered RGG domain from LAF-1, a model protein involved in phase separation and a key component of P granules. Based on a predictive coarse-grained IDP model, we identified a region of the RGG domain that has high contact probability and is highly conserved between species; deletion of this region significantly disrupts phase separation in vitro and in vivo. We determined the effects of charge patterning on phase behavior through sequence shuffling. By altering the wild-type sequence, which contains well-mixed charged residues, to increase charge segregation, we designed sequences with significantly increased phase separation propensity. This result indicates the natural sequence is under negative selection to moderate this mode of interaction. We measured the contributions of tyrosine and arginine residues to phase separation experimentally through mutagenesis studies and computationally through direct interrogation of different modes of interaction using all-atom simulations. Finally, we show that in spite of these sequence perturbations, the RGG-derived condensates remain liquid-like. Together, these studies advance a predictive framework and identify key biophysical principles of sequence features important to phase separation.

Significance StatementMembraneless organelles are assemblies of highly concentrated biomolecules that form through a liquid-liquid phase separation process. These assemblies are often enriched in intrinsically disordered proteins, which play an important role in driving phase separation. Understanding the sequence-to-phase behavior relationship of these disordered proteins is important for understanding the biochemistry of membraneless organelles, as well as for designing synthetic organelles and biomaterials. In this work, we explore a model protein, the disordered N-terminal domain of LAF-1, and highlight how three key features of the sequence control the proteins propensity to phase separate. Combining predictive simulations with experiments, we find that phase behavior of this model IDP is dictated by the presence of a short conserved domain, charge patterning, and arginine-tyrosine interactions.","NA"

When used together with a super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope, STED-FCS can measure diffusion processes at the nanoscale in living cells.

However, STED-FCS faces severe limitations when measuring diffusion in three dimensions (3D), largely due to the spurious background contributions from undepleted areas of the excitation focus that reduce the signal quality and ultimately limit the resolution. In this paper, we investigate how different STED confinement modes can mitigate this issue. By simulations as well as experiments with fluorescent probes in solution and in cells, we demonstrate that the coherent-hybrid (CH) depletion pattern reduces background most efficiently and thus provides superior signal quality under comparable reduction of the observation volume.

GenomeChronicler was written as part of the Personal Genome Project UK (PGP-UK) to address this need. PGP-UK provides genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and self-reported phenotypic data under an open-access model with full ethical approval. As a result, the reports generated by GenomeChronicler are intended for research purposes only and include information relating to potentially beneficial and potentially harmful variants, but without clinical curation.

GenomeChronicler can be used with data from whole genome or whole exome sequencing producing a genome report containing information on variant statistics, ancestry and known associated phenotypic traits. Example reports are available from the PGP-UK data page (personalgenomes.org.uk/data).

The objective of this method is to leverage on existing resources to find known phenotypes associated with the genotypes detected in each sample. The provided trait data is based primarily upon information available in SNPedia, but also collates data from ClinVar, GETevidence and gnomAD to provide additional details on potential health implications, presence of genotype in other PGP participants and population frequency of each genotype.

The whole pipeline is self-contained, and runs without internet connection, making it a good choice for privacy conscious projects that can run GenomeChronicler within their off-line safe-haven environments. GenomeChronicler can be run for one sample at a time, or in parallel making use of the nextflow workflow manager.

The source code is available from GitHub (https://github.com/PGP-UK/GenomeChronicler), container recipes are available for Docker and Singularity, as well as a pre-built container from SingularityHub (https://singularity-hub.org/collections/3664) enabling easy deployment in a variety of settings.

In epithelial cancer, hypoxia further induces the transition to amoeboid cancer cell dissemination, yet the molecular mechanisms, relevance for metastasis, and effective interventions to combat hypoxia-induced amoeboid reprogramming remain unclear. Here, we identify calpain-2 as key regulator and anti-metastasis target of hypoxia-induced transition from collective to amoeboid dissemination of breast and head and neck (HN) carcinoma cells. Hypoxia-induced amoeboid dissemination occurred through low ECM-adhesive, bleb-based amoeboid movement, which effectively invaded into 3D collagen with low-oxidative and -glycolytic energy metabolism, revealing an microenvironmentally-induced, energy-conserving dissemination route in epithelial cancers. Hypoxia-induced calpain-2 mediated amoeboid conversion by de-activating beta1 integrins, through enzymatic cleavage of the focal adhesion adaptor protein talin-1. Consequently, targeted downregulation of calpain-2 or pharmacological intervention restored talin-1 integrity, beta1 integrin engagement and reverted blebbing-amoeboid to elongated phenotypes under hypoxia. Calpain-2 activity was required for hypoxia-induced blebbing-amoeboid conversion in the orthotopic mouse dermis, and upregulated in invasive HN tumor xenografts in vivo, and attenuation of calpain activity prevented hypoxia-induced metastasis to the lungs. This identifies the calpain-2/talin-1/beta1 integrin axis as mechanosignaling program and promising intervention target of plasticity of cancer cell invasion and metastasis formation in epithelial cancers under hypoxia.","NA"

Yet the evolution of gene expression is currently not well understood. In recent years, new tissue/organ specific gene expression datasets spanning several organisms across the tree of life, have become available providing the opportunity to study gene expression evolution in more detail. However, while a theoretical model to study evolution of continuous traits exist, in practice computational methods often cannot distinguish, with confidence, between alternative evolutionary scenarios. This lack of power has been attributed to the modest number of species with available expression data.

To solve this challenge, we introduce EvoGeneX, a computationally efficient method to uncover the mode of gene expression evolution based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Importantly, EvoGeneX in addition to modelling expression variations between species, models within species variation. To estimate the within species variation, EvoGeneX formally incorporates the data from biological replicates as a part of the mathematical model. We show that by modelling the within species diversity EvoGeneX significantly outperforms the currently available computational method. In addition, to facilitate comparative analysis of gene expression evolution, we introduce a new approach to measure the dynamics of evolutionary divergence of a group of genes.

We used EvoGeneX to analyse the evolution of expression across different organs, species and sexes of the Drosophila genus. Our analysis revealed differences in the evolutionary dynamics of male and female gonads, and uncovered examples of adaptive evolution of genes expressed in the head and in the thorax.","NA"

The Candida ablicans yeast-to-hyphal switch and Histoplasm capsulatum mycelial-to-yeast switch both contribute to pathogenesis, and switch-deficient mutants show reduced virulence. In response to the host lung environment, the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans exhibits an unusual yeast-to-titan transition thought to enhance pathogenicity by increasing fungal survival in the host lung and dissemination to the central nervous system. In a common laboratory strain (H99), titan cells affect virulence via increased cell size and ploidy, reduced phagocytosis, altered cell wall structure, and increased survival under host and drug stress. However, clinical and environmental isolates show a wide range in their capacity to switch, and the extent of this variation and implications for virulence remain unknown. Using new in vitro induction models, we are now able to generate titans that exhibit all the features of in vivo-generated titans. Here, we characterize key changes in clinical isolates after titanization, revealing that non-titanizing strains also show high population heterogeneity both in vitro and in vivo. In addition to reinforcing previously demonstrated in vivo phenotypes, we show that ""non-titanizing"" isolates differentially recruit immune cells, exhibit altered PAMP exposure over time, and can still generate aneuploidy in vitro and in vivo with implications for drug resistance in both the lung and the brain.

ImportanceMany human fungal pathogens undergo morphological transitions to survive in the host environment. In response to host stimuli, the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans exhibits an unusual yeast-to-titan morphological switch that contributes to disease development by altering immune polarization and introducing aneuploidy underlying host stress and drug resistance. Titans comprise a minority population and are defined by size, DNA content, and changes in cell wall and capsule structure using standard laboratory isolates. However, questions remain about the identification of this switch among clinical isolates. Here we demonstrate that population heterogeneity exists widely among in vivo mouse-passaged and in vitro-induced Cryptococcal clinical isolates, regardless of titanizing capacity. Upon encountering host environmental stimuli, aneuploid daughters are generated both by titanizing and non-titanizing isolates, resulting in populations with altered drug resistance. Studying population heterogeneity in the context of clinical isolates will improve understanding of the role of aneuploidy in disease outcomes.","NA"

However, it is unclear how loss of vacuolar acidity results in age-related dysfunction. Through unbiased genetic screens, we determined that increased iron uptake can suppress the mitochondrial respiratory deficiency phenotype of yeast vma mutants, which have lost vacuolar acidity due to genetic disruption of the vacuolar ATPase proton pump. Yeast vma mutants exhibited nuclear localization of Aft1, which turns on the iron regulon in response to iron sulfur cluster (ISC) deficiency. This led us to find that loss of vacuolar acidity with age in wildtype yeast causes ISC defects and a DNA damage response. Using microfluidics to investigate aging at the single cell level, we observe grossly divergent trajectories of iron homeostasis within an isogenic and environmentally homogeneous population. One subpopulation of cells fails to mount the expected compensatory iron regulon gene expression program, and suffers progressively severe ISC deficiency with little to no activation of the iron regulon. In contrast, other cells show robust iron regulon activity with limited ISC deficiency, which allows extended passage and survival through a period of genomic instability during aging. These divergent trajectories suggest that iron regulation and ISC homeostasis represent a possible target for aging interventions.","10.1007/s11357-020-00159-3"

We then analyzed human behavior to show that information complexity, which unlike computational complexity can be estimated from behavior, tended to increase for strategies that were increasingly either model-free or model-based, resulting in similar accuracy, suboptimal use of information, and increased response times.

Here, we used a large set of different natural scene fragments to investigate whether this sorting mechanism can operate across the diverse visual environments encountered during real-world vision. We recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants viewed incomplete scene fragments at fixation. Using representational similarity analysis on the EEG data, we tracked the fragments cortical representations across time. We found that the fragments typical vertical location within the environment (top or bottom) predicted their cortical representations, indexing a sorting of information according to spatial schemata. The fragments cortical representations were most strongly organized by their vertical location at around 200ms after image onset, suggesting rapid perceptual sorting of information according to spatial schemata.

By demonstrating this sorting across a wide range of visually diverse scenes, our study suggests a contextualization mechanism suitable for complex and variable real-world environments.","NA"

This is of interest because different mathematical theories of decision-making differ in their predictions regarding the correlation of accuracy with reaction time. On the premise that sensory decision-making mechanisms are likely to be conserved in mammals, our objective is to reconcile these results a common theoretical framework. A bounded drift diffusion model (DDM) with stochastic parameters is a strong candidate, because it is known to be able to produce either late errors like humans, or early errors like rats.

The induction of NADPH oxidase RBOHD expression occurs specifically on the lesion border during resistance response.

RBOHD is required for spatial accumulation of SA, and conversely RBOHD is under transcriptional regulation of SA signaling.

Tomato has three GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) GA receptors with overlapping activities and high redundancy. We have tested whether mutation in a single GID1 reduces transpiration without affecting growth and productivity. CRISPR-Cas9 gid1 mutants were able to maintain higher leaf water content under water-deficit conditions. Moreover, while gid1a exhibited normal growth, it showed reduced whole plant transpiration and better recovery from dehydration. Mutation in GID1a inhibited xylem vessels proliferation that led to lower hydraulic conductance. In stronger GA mutants, we also found reduced xylem vessel expansion. These results suggest that low GA activity affects transpiration by multiple mechanisms; it reduces leaf area, promotes stomatal closure and reduces xylem proliferation and expansion and as a result, xylem hydraulic conductance. We further examined if gid1a perform better than the control M82 in the field. Under these conditions, the high redundancy of GID1s was lost and gid1a plants were semi-dwarf, but their productivity was not affected. Although gid1a did not perform better under drought conditions in the field, it exhibited higher harvest index.

We propose two approaches for solving classes of these generalised systems. The first approach offers a fresh perspective on a general class of multistate models, and allows us to ""decompose"" more complicated systems into simpler processes, each of which can be solved analytically. This enables us to obtain a solution of any model from this class. We further show that these models cannot have a heavy-tailed distribution in the absence of extrinsic noise. Next, we develop an approximation method based on a power series expansion of the stationary distribution for an even broader class of multistate models of gene transcription. The combination of analytical and computational solutions for these realistic gene expression models also holds the potential to design synthetic systems, and control the behaviour of naturally evolved gene expression systems, e.g. in guiding cell-fate decisions.","10.1063/1.5143540"

Syt2a is widely distributed throughout the midbrain and hindbrain early during larval development but very weakly expressed in the forebrain. Later in development, Syt2a expression levels increase, particularly in regions associated with social behavior, and most intriguingly, around the time social behavior becomes apparent. We provide evidence that Syt2a localizes to synapses on socially-relevant neurons in the ventral forebrain, co-localizing with tyrosine hydroxylase, a biosynthetic enzyme in the dopamine pathway. Our results suggest a maturation step for synapses in the forebrain that are spatiotemporally related to social behavior.","NA"

As X-ray/NMR structures are unavailable with the nitroxide labels, detailed residue level information, down to atomic resolution, about the effect of these nitroxide labels on local RNA structures is currently lacking. This information is critical to evaluate the choice of spin label. In this study, we compare and contrast the effect of TEMPO-based (NT) and rigid spin (C) labels (in both 2-O methylated and not-methylated forms) on RNA duplexes. We also investigate sequence-dependent effects of NT label on RNA duplex along with the more complex G-quadruplex RNA. Distances measured from molecular dynamics simulations between the two spin labels are in agreement with the EPR experimental data. To understand the effect of labeled oligonucleotides on the structure, we studied the local base pair geometries and global structure in comparison with the unlabeled structures. Based on the structural analysis, we can conclude that TEMPO-based and C labels do not significantly perturb the base pair arrangements of the native oligonucleotide. When experimental structures for the spin labelled DNA/RNA molecules are not available, general framework offered by the current study can be used to provide information critical to the choice of spin labels to facilitate future EPR studies.

In the initial release of bdmm, analyses were limited to trees consisting of up to approximately 250 genetic samples for numerical reasons. We implemented important algorithmic changes to bdmm which dramatically increase the number of genetic samples that can be analyzed, and improve the numerical robustness and efficiency of the calculations. Being able to use bigger datasets leads to improved precision of parameter estimates. Furthermore, we report on several model extensions to bdmm, inspired by properties common to empirical datasets. We apply this improved algorithm to two partly overlapping datasets of Influenza A virus HA sequences sampled around the world, one with 500 samples, the other with only 175, for comparison. We report and compare the global migration patterns and seasonal dynamics inferred from each dataset.

Among the most crucial reactions in this cycle is the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, an obligately aerobic process performed by a limited number of lineages of bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). As this process has an absolute requirement for O2, the timing of its evolution - especially as it relates to the Great Oxygenation Event ~2.3 billion years ago - remains contested and is pivotal to our understanding of nutrient cycles. To estimate the antiquity of bacterial ammonia oxidation, we performed phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses of AOB. Surprisingly, bacterial ammonia oxidation appears quite young, with crown group clades having originated during Neoproterozoic time (or later) with major radiations occurring during Paleozoic time. These results place the evolution of AOB broadly coincident with the pervasive oxygenation of the deep ocean. The late evolution AOB challenges earlier interpretations of the ancient nitrogen isotope record, predicts a more substantial role for AOA during Precambrian time, and may have implications for understanding of the size and structure of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle through geologic time.","NA"

We observed eye movements that appeared to continuously track the goal location even when no visible target was present there. Accurate goal-tracking was associated with improved task performance, and inhibiting eye movements in humans impaired navigation precision. By using passive stimulus playback and manipulating stimulus reliability, we show that subjects eye movements are likely voluntary, rather than reflexive.

We used this approach to identify the transcriptome of white matter endothelial cells after the onset of diet-induced obesity (DIO).

In the white matter, endothelial CXCL5 acts as a chemoattractant and promotes the association of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) with cerebral endothelia increasing vessel-associated OPC cell number and triggers OPC gene expression programs regulating migration and chemokine receptor activation. Targeted blockade of IL-17B with peripheral antibody administration reduced the population of vessel-associated OPCs by reducing endothelial CXCL5 expression.

Despite rapid progress in understanding the function of distinct neuronal population, the parameters of connectivity that are required for the function of these microcircuits remain unknown. Recent studies found that two most common inhibitory interneurons, parvalbumin- (PV) and somatostatin-(SST) positive interneurons control sound-evoked responses, temporal adaptation and network dynamics in the auditory cortex (AC). These studies can inform our understanding of parameters for connectivity of the excitatory-inhibitory cortical circuits. Specifically, we asked whether a common microcircuit can account for the disparate effects found in studies in different groups. We built rate and spiking models of the auditory cortex consisting of excitatory, PV and SST neurons, and searched the space of connectivity parameters to identify the set that can account for the experimental findings from multiple groups. We identified microcircuit parameters that accounted for the differential effects of PVs and SSTs in stimulus-specific adaptation, forward suppression and tuning-curve adaptation, as well as the influence of PVs on functional connectivity in the circuit. The unifying mechanisms of the model included a depressing synapse from PVs to excitatory neurons, and a facilitating synapse from excitatory neurons to SSTs. This approach brought together multiple findings from different laboratories and identified a unified circuit that can be used in future studies of upstream and downstream sensory processing.

Significance StatementThe mammalian auditory cortex is comprised of multiple types of inhibitory and excitatory neurons, which form sophisticated microcircuits for processing and transmitting sensory information. Distinct inhibitory neuron subtypes play distinct functions in auditory processing, but it remains unknown whether these phenomena are due to a unified microcircuit or require multiple circuits. Here, we built minimal rate and spiking models and identified a specific set of synaptic mechanisms and parameters that could best reproduce the broad set of experimental results in the auditory cortex. The simplicity of our model provides an understanding of inhibitory cortical processing at the circuit level, unifying the results from different laboratories, and provides for a novel computational framework for future studies of cortical function.","NA"

However, conducting PCA analyses can be complicated and has several potential pitfalls. These pitfalls include (1) capturing Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) structure instead of population structure, (2) projected PCs that suffer from shrinkage bias, (3) detecting sample outliers, and (4) uneven population sizes. In this work, we explore these potential issues when using PCA, and present efficient solutions to these. Following applications to the UK Biobank and the 1000 Genomes project datasets, we make recommendations for best practices and provide efficient and user-friendly implementations of the proposed solutions in R packages bigsnpr and bigutilsr.

For example, we find that PC19 to PC40 in the UK Biobank capture complex LD structure rather than population structure. Using our automatic algorithm for removing long-range LD regions, we recover 16 PCs that capture population structure only. Therefore, we recommend using only 16-18 PCs from the UK Biobank to account for population structure confounding. We also show how to use PCA to restrict analyses to individuals of homogeneous ancestry. Finally, when projecting individual genotypes onto the PCA computed from the 1000 Genomes project data, we find a shrinkage bias that becomes large for PC5 and beyond. We then demonstrate how to obtain unbiased projections efficiently using bigsnpr.

Overall, we believe this work would be of interest for anyone using PCA in their analyses of genetic data, as well as for other omics data.","NA"

In this work, after a systematic search, nine microarray datasets evaluating host gene expression in leprosy were reanalyzed and the information was integrated to strengthen evidence of differential expression for several genes.

ResultsReanalysis of individual datasets revealed several differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then, five integration methods were tested, both at the P-value and effect size level. In the end, random effects model (REM) and ratio association (sdef) were selected as the main methods to pinpoint DEGs. Overall, some classic gene/pathways were found corroborating previous findings and validating this approach for analysis. Also, various original DEGs related to poorly understood processes in leprosy were described. Nevertheless, some of the novel genes have already been associated with leprosy pathogenesis by genetic or functional studies, whilst others are, as yet, unrelated or poorly studied in these contexts.

ConclusionsThis study reinforces evidences of differential expression of several genes and presents novel genes and pathways associated with leprosy pathogenesis. Altogether, these data are useful in better understanding host responses to the disease and, at the same time, provide a list of potential host biomarkers that could be useful in complementing leprosy diagnosis based on transcriptional levels.","NA"

Twenty-two EOP patients (11 unmedicated) and 33 healthy controls, aged between 12-18 years, underwent 3T diffusion-weighted MRI. Using Tract-based Spatial Statistics, we calculate case-control differences in scalar diffusion measures, i.e. fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusion (AD) and radial diffusion (RD), and investigated their association with antipsychotic medication. We found significantly lower mean FA and AD in largely overlapping areas, particularly in left anterior corona radiata (ACR), in EOP patients relative to healthy controls. Mean FA in the left ACR was significantly associated with antipsychotic medication status (t = 2.991, p = 0.008, R2 = 0.298), showing higher FA values in medicated compared to unmedicated EOP patients. The present study is the first to link antipsychotic medication status to altered regional FA in the left ACR, a region being discussed to contribute to the etiology of psychosis. Yet, further work with larger samples is needed to draw firm conclusions about putatively enhancing effects of antipsychotic medication on white matter microstructure early in the disease process.","NA"

However, it is not known what happens when mutation rates are high and population sizes are small at the same time. Using a simple fitness model with variable epistasis, we show that the equilibrium fitness has a minimum as a function of the parameter that tunes epistasis, implying that this critical point is an unstable fixed point for evolutionary trajectories. In agent-based simulations of evolution at finite mutation rate, we demonstrate that when mutations can change epistasis, trajectories with a subcritical value of epistasis evolve to decrease epistasis, while those with supercritical initial points evolve towards higher epistasis.

Initial colonisation by the smooth colony M. abscessus (S) can be followed by an irreversible genetic switch into a highly inflammatory rough colony M. abscessus (R), often associated with a decline in pulmonary function. Currently available animal models such as the embryonic zebrafish, have largely explored the role of innate immunity in the pathogenesis of M. abscessus, and demonstrated that infection with the R variant produces a hyperinflammatory infection due to the presence of large extracellular cords, whereas the S variant produces a chronic persistent infection. However, our understanding of the role of adaptive immunity in M. abscessus pathogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we have used intraperitoneal infection of adult zebrafish to model M. abscessus pathogenesis in the context of fully functioning host immunity. We find infection with the R variant penetrates host organs causing an inflammatory immune response leading to necrotic granuloma and abscess formation within 2 weeks. The R bacilli are targeted by T cell-mediated immunity and burden is progressively reduced. Strikingly, the S variant colonises host internal surfaces at high loads and is met with a robust innate immune response but little T cell-mediated immunity. Invasive granuloma formation is delayed in S variant infection compared to R variant infection upon which T cell-mediated immunity is required to control infection. In mixed infections, the S variant outcompetes the R variant in an adaptive-immunity dependent manner. We also find the R variant activates innate immunity to detriment of S variant M. abscessus in mixed infections. These findings demonstrate the applicability of the adult zebrafish to model persistent M. abscessus infection and provide insight into the immunopathogenesis of chronic M. abscessus infection.

In mammals, PER2 protein abundance is regulated by CK1-mediated phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation. On the other hand, recent studies have questioned whether the degradation of the core circadian machinery is a critical step in clock regulation. Prior cell-based studies found that CK1 phosphorylation of PER2 at Ser478 recruits the ubiquitin E3 ligase {beta}-TrCP, leading to PER2 degradation. Creation of this phosphodegron is regulated by a phosphoswitch that is also implicated in temperature compensation. However, in vivo evidence that this phosphodegron influences circadian period is lacking. Here, we generated and analyzed PER2-Ser478Ala knock-in mice. The mice showed longer circadian period in behavioral analysis. Molecularly, mutant PER2 protein accumulated in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of the mouse liver, while Per2 mRNA levels were minimally affected. Nuclear PER1, CRY1 and CRY2 proteins also increased, probably due to stabilization of PER2-containing complexes. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from PER2-Ser478Ala::LUC mice, three-phase decay and temperature compensation of the circadian period was perturbed. These data provide direct in vivo evidence for the importance of phosphorylation-regulated PER2 stability in the circadian clock and validate the phosphoswitch in a mouse model.","NA"

KRAS is the most commonly mutated gene in pancreatic cancer, but clinical agents that directly target mutant KRAS are not available. Several effector pathways are activated downstream of oncogenic Kras, including MAPK signaling. MAPK signaling can be inhibited by targeting MEK1/2; unfortunately, this approach has been largely ineffective in pancreatic cancer. Here, we set out to identify mechanisms of MEK inhibitor resistance in pancreatic cancer using primary mouse and human 3D organoid cultures. We optimized the culture of pancreatic tumor organoids that utilized Matrigel as a basement membrane mimetic, facilitating polarized growth. Pancreatic tumor organoids recapitulated mutant KRAS dependency and recalcitrance to MEK inhibition. Treatment of the organoids with trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, had only a modest effect on these cultures. We observed that cells adjacent to the basement membrane mimetic Matrigel survived MEK inhibition, while the cells in the interior layers underwent apoptosis. Our findings suggested that basement membrane attachment provided survival signals. We thus targeted integrin {beta}1, a mediator of extracellular matrix contact, and found that combined MEK and integrin {beta}1 inhibition bypassed trametinib resistance.

To monitor the temporal dynamics of processing, we recorded multiple-unit firings of CA1 neurons in male rats experiencing one of four episodes for 10 min: restraint stress, social interaction with a female or male, or observation of a novel object. Before an experience, the neurons mostly exhibited sporadic firings with some synchronized ({approx} 50 ms) ripple-like firing events in habituated home cage. After experience onset, restraint or social interaction with other rats induced spontaneous high-frequency firings (super bursts) intermittently, while object observation induced the events inconsistently. Minutes after experience initiation, CA1 neurons frequently exhibited ripple-like firings with less-firing silent periods. The number of ripple-like events depended on the episode experienced and correlated with the total duration of super bursts. Experience clearly diversified multiple features of individual ripple-like events in an episode-specific manner, sustained for more than 30 min in the home cage.

Ex vivo patch clamp analysis further revealed experience-promoted synaptic plasticity. Compared with unexposed controls, animals experiencing the female, male, or restraint episodes showed cell-dependently increased AMPA- or GABAA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents, whereas contact with a novel object increased only GABAergic currents. Multivariate ANOVA in multi-dimensional virtual space revealed experience-specific super bursts with subsequent ripple-like events and synaptic plasticity, leading us to hypothesize that these factors are responsible for creating experience-specific memory. It is possible to decipher encrypted experience through the deep learning of the orchestrated ripple-like firings and synaptic plasticity in multiple CA1 neurons.","NA"

One such mechanism is the highly conserved p38 MAPK (p38K) pathway, which is known to be to post-translationally activated in response to oxidative stress resulting in the activation of downstream antioxidant targets. However, little is known about the role of p38K transcriptional regulation in response to oxidative stress. Therefore, we analyzed the p38K gene family across the genus Drosophila to identify conserved regulatory elements. We find that oxidative stress exposure results in increased p38K protein levels in multiple Drosophila species and is associated with increased oxidative stress resistance. We also find that the p38Kb genomic locus includes conserved binding sites for the AP-1 and lola-PT transcription factors. Accordingly, over-expression of these transcription factors in D. melanogaster is sufficient to induce transcription of p38Kb and enhances resistance to oxidative stress. We further find that the presence of a lola-PT binding site in the p38Kb locus of a given species is predictive of the species survival in response to oxidative stress. Through our comparative genomics approach, we have identified biologically relevant transcription factor binding sites that regulate the expression of p38Kb and are associated with resistance to oxidative stress. These findings reveal a novel mode of regulation for p38K genes and suggests that transcription may play as important a role in p38K mediated stress responses as post-translational modifications.

Significance StatementOrganisms encounter a variety of environmental stresses such as oxidative stress throughout their lifetime. Therefore, organisms have evolved a number of mechanisms to combat these stresses. In order to understand how these mechanisms evolved, we have compared the genomes of a diverse set of species across the genus Drosophila to examine the p38 MAPK stress response gene family. Our analysis was able to successfully predict transcription factors that not only regulate our target gene, p38Kb, but do so under different conditions to ensure an appropriate stress response. Therefore, we find that in addition to post-translational regulation, transcriptional regulation of signaling pathways may also play an important role in how organisms are able to adapt to stressful environments or respond to stress conditions as they arise. Furthermore, our comparative genomics approach may be utilized to identify transcriptional regulators of other highly conserved signaling pathways.","NA"

We reveal that T-bet-dependent production of IFN-{gamma} is essential for the maintenance of inflammatory DCs at the site of infection with a common protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. A detailed analysis of the cellular sources for T-bet-dependent IFN-{gamma} identified that ILC1s, but not NK or TH1 cells, were involved in the regulation of inflammatory DCs via IFN-{gamma}. Mechanistically, we established that T-bet dependent ILC1-derived IFN-{gamma} is critical for the induction of IRF8, an essential transcription factor for cDC1s. Failure to upregulate IRF8 in DCs resulted in acute susceptibility to T. gondii infection. Our data identifies that ILC1-derived IFN-{gamma} is indispensable for host resistance against intracellular infection via maintaining IRF8+ inflammatory DCs at the site of infection.

Author SummaryMounting a robust type I innate immune response is essential for resistance against numerous intracellular pathogens. The type I immune response is characterized by the production of IFN-{gamma}, a central cytokine required for multiple non-redundant effector functions against bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. Previous work has shown that group 1 innate lymphocyte cells (ILC1s) together with NK and CD4+ T cells play an indispensable IFN-{gamma} mediated protective role against Toxoplasma gondii infection; yet, the pathway of how IFN-{gamma} produced by ILC1s defend against T. gondii remains unknown. In this work we identified that early production of IFN-{gamma} by ILC1 is essential for maintaining dendritic cells (DCs) during infection. Mechanistically, we reveal that ILC1-derived IFN-{gamma} is indispensable for inducing the transcription factor IRF8 that is critical for sustaining inflammatory DCs. Finally, we demonstrate that IRF8+ DCs are critical for parasite elimination.","NA"

Although there are some indirect data about microparticles participation in coagulation activation and propagation, the integral hemostasis test Thrombodynamics allows to measure micropaticles participation in these two coagulation phases directly by influence on the appearance of coagulation centers in plasma volume and on the rate of clot grown from surface with immobilized tissue factor.

MethodsMicroparticles were obtained from platelets and erythrocytes by stimulation with SFLLRN and A23187, respectively, from monocytes, endothelial HUVEC culture and monocytic THP cell culture by stimulation with lipopolysaccharides. Microparticles were counted by flow cytometry and titrated in microparticle-depleted normal plasma in the Thrombodynamics test.

ResultsMonocyte microparticles induced the appearance of clotting centres through the TF pathway at concentrations approximately 100-fold lower than platelet and erythrocyte microparticles, which activated plasma by the contact pathway. For endothelial microparticles, both activation pathways were essential, and their activity was intermediate. Monocyte microparticles induced plasma clotting by the appearance of hundreds of clots with an extremely slow growth rate, while erythrocyte microparticles induced the appearance of a few clots with a growth rate similar to that from surface covered with high-density tissue factor. Patterns of clotting induced by platelet and endothelial microparticles were intermediate. Platelet, erythrocyte and endothelial microparticles impacts on the rate of clot growth from the surface with tissue factor did not differ significantly within the 0-200{middle dot}103/ul range of microparticles concentrations. However, at concentrations greater than 500{middle dot}103/ul, erythrocyte microparticles increased the stationary clot growth rate to significantly higher levels than do platelet microparticles or artificial phospholipid vesicles consisting of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine.

While both proteins are required during meiotic homologous recombination, their spatial organization during meiotic DSB repair is not fully understood. Using super-resolution microscopy on mouse spermatocyte nuclei, we aimed to define their relative position at DSB foci, and how these vary in time. We show that a large fraction of meiotic DSB repair foci (38%) contained a single RAD51 cluster and a single DMC1 cluster (D1R1 configuration) that were partially overlapping (average center-center distance around 70 nm). The majority of the rest of the foci had a similar combination of a major RAD51 and DMC1 cluster, but in combination with additional clusters (D2R1, D1R2, D2R2, or DxRy configuration) at an average distance of around 250 nm. As prophase progressed, less D1R1 and more D2R1 foci were observed, where the RAD51 cluster in the D2R1 foci elongated and gradually oriented towards the distant DMC1 cluster. This correlated with more frequently observed RAD51 bridges between the two DMC1 clusters. D1R2 foci frequency was more constant, and the single DMC1 cluster did not elongate, but was observed more frequently in between the two RAD51 clusters in early stages. D2R2 foci were rare (<10%) and nearest neighbour analyses also did not reveal pair formation between D1R1 foci. In the absence of the transverse filament of the synaptonemal complex (connecting the chromosomal axes of homologs), early configurations were more prominent, and RAD51 elongation occurred only transiently. This in-depth analysis of single cell landscapes of RAD51 and DMC1 accumulation patterns at DSB repair sites at super-resolution thus revealed the variability of foci composition, and defined functional consensus configurations that change over time.

AUTHOR SUMMARYMeiosis is a specific type of cell division that is central to sperm and egg formation in sexual reproduction. It forms cells with a single copy of each chromosome, instead of the two copies that are normally present. In meiotic prophase, homologous chromosomes must connect to each other, to be correctly distributed between the daughter cells. This involves the formation and repair of double-strand breaks in the DNA. Here we used super-resolution microscopy to elucidate the localization patterns of two important DNA repair proteins: RAD51 and DMC1. We found that repair sites most often contain a single large cluster of both proteins, with or without one additional smaller cluster of either protein. RAD51 protein clusters displayed lengthening as meiotic prophase progressed. When chromosome pairing was disturbed, we observed changes in the dynamics of protein accumulation patterns, indicating that they actually correspond to certain repair intermediates changing in relative frequency of occurrence. These analyses of single meiotic DNA repair foci reveal the biological variability in protein accumulation patterns, and the localization of RAD51 and DMC1 relative to each other, thereby contributing to our understanding of the molecular basis of meiotic homologous recombination.","NA"

We observed that TMB was correlated with tumor purity, ploidy, and the level of aneuploidy, as well as with the expression of cell proliferation-related genes representing genomic covariates in evaluating TMB. Correlative analyses of mutation signature levels with genes belonging to DNA damage-repair processes revealed that deficiencies of NHEJ1 and ALKBH3 may elevate TMB levels in cancer genomes accompanying APOBEC overactivity and DNA mismatch repair deficiency, respectively. We further employed a strategy to identify feature-driven, de novo mutation signatures and demonstrated they can be reconstructed using known causal features such as APOBEC overexpression, MLH1 underexpression, POLE mutations, and the level of homologous recombination deficiency. We further demonstrated, that tumor hypoxia-related mutation signatures are similar to those associated with APOBEC suggesting that APOBEC-related mutagenic activity mediates hypoxia-related mutational consequences in cancer genomes, and also, that mutation signatures can be further used to predict hypoxic tumors.

This study assessed the effluents from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka Wastewater Treatment Plant (UNN-WWTP) as well as vegetables irrigated with the effluent, and vegetables sold in selected markets from Nsukka and Enugu cities for the presence of E. coli and determined the prevalence integrons in multidrug-resistant isolates. Isolation of E. coli was done using eosin methylene blue agar and isolates subjected to Gram staining for identification of presumptive colonies. Confirmation of E. coli was achieved by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, targeting beta-glucuronidase (uidA). Resistance to antibiotics was determined using the Bauer-Kirby disk diffusion assay and the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute criteria. Integrons were detected by multiplex PCR using primers specific for class 1 and 2 integrons. A total of 178 E. coli isolates were obtained from WWTP effluent (41), and vegetables from greenhouse (46), farms (55) and market (36). Multi-drug resistance was detected in all the isolates, ranging from five-drug resistance in a single isolate to 16-drug resistance patterns in two different isolates. Of the total isolates, class 1 integrons were abundantly detected in 175 (98.3%) and class 2 in 5 (2.8%). All the class 2 integrons were found in isolates that were positive for class 1. The high detection of E. coli in the studied effluent and vegetables pose potential public health hazards heightened by observed multidrug resistance in all the isolates and the high prevalence of class 1 integron. It is concluded that the vegetable samples are significant reservoirs for potentially pathogenic E. coli. Therefore, vegetable irrigation farming with unsafe water should be discontinued, while appropriate improvement strategies to ensure compliance should be facilitated without further delay.","NA"

While normally silenced in healthy somatic tissue, SINEs can be induced during infection with DNA viruses, including the model murine gammaherpesvirus MHV68. Here, we explored the mechanisms underlying MHV68 activation of SINE ncRNAs. We demonstrate that lytic MHV68 infection of B cells, macrophages and fibroblasts leads to robust activation of the B2 family of SINEs in a cell autonomous manner. B2 ncRNA induction requires neither host innate immune signaling factors nor involvement of the RNAPIII master regulator Maf1. However, we identify MHV68 ORF36, the conserved herpesviral kinase, as playing a key role in B2 induction during lytic infection. SINE activation is linked to ORF36 kinase activity and can also be induced by HDAC1/2 inhibition, which is one of the known ORF36 functions. Collectively, our data suggest that ORF36-mediated changes in chromatin modification contribute to B2 activation during MHV68 infection, and that this activity is conserved in other herpesviral protein kinase homologs.

AUTHOR SUMMARYViral infection dramatically changes the levels of many types of RNA in a cell. In particular, certain oncogenic viruses activate expression of repetitive genes called retrotransposons, which are normally silenced due to their ability to copy and spread throughout the genome. Here, we established that infection with the gammaherpesvirus MHV68 leads to a dramatic induction of a class of noncoding retrotransposons called B2 SINEs in multiple cell types. We then explored how MHV68 activates B2 SINEs, revealing a role for the conserved herpesviral protein kinase ORF36. Both ORF36 kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions contribute to B2 induction, perhaps through ORF36 targeting of proteins involved in controlling the accessibility of chromatin surrounding SINE loci. Understanding features underlying induction of these elements following MHV68 infection should provide insight into core elements of SINE regulation, as well as dis-regulation of SINE elements associated with disease.","NA"

In this paper, we analyze both visual and auditory EEG and auditory MEG signals recorded during oddball tasks to examine which temporal components in these signals are sufficient to decode the brains surprise based on each of these three definitions. We found that for both recording systems the Shannon surprise is always significantly better decoded than the Bayesian surprise regardless of the sensory modality and the selected temporal features used for decoding.

Three surprise quantification definitions (Shannon, Bayesian, and Confidence-corrected surprise) are compared in offering decoding power. Four different regimes for selecting temporal samples of EEG and MEG data are used to evaluate which part of the recorded data may contain signatures that represent the brains surprise in terms of offering a high decoding power. We found that both the middle and late components of the EEG response offer strong decoding power for surprise while the early components are significantly weaker in decoding surprise. In the MEG response, we found that the middle components have the highest decoding power while the late components offer moderate decoding powers. When using a single temporal sample for decoding surprise, samples of the middle segment possess the highest decoding power. Shannon surprise is always better decoded than the other definitions of surprise for all the four temporal feature selection regimes.

However, the dynamical events that lead to such self organization of different types of proteins are still poorly understood due to the experimentally untractable complex molecular mechanism, which governs the process of amyloidogenesis. Herein, we propose a generic and data-driven mathematical modeling approach that enables us to decipher a most probable molecular mechanism responsible for amyloidogensis in a context dependent manner. The preferred model efficiently elucidates various aspects of amyloid forming kinetics as a function of initial protein concentration, and qualitatively predicts the dynamics of amyloidogenesis for point mutated proteins. Importantly, the model analysis reveals that intermediate aggregates formed just after the primary necleation steps plays a vital role in dictating the nature of amyloid forming kinetics. Moreover, our model makes experimentally feasible insightful predictions to formulate better therapeutic measures in future to counter unwanted amyloidogenesis by just fine-tuning the molecular interactions related to amyloidogenesis.

Author SummaryIn cells, proteins mostly function by being in a native folded conformation. However, under certain circumstances, some of these proteins undergo high degree of aggregation and eventually misfold to form highly stable amyloid aggregates that are often involved in different neurodegenerative disease progression and pathogenesis. To develop appropriate therapeutic strategies to resist such oligomerazation of protein, it is imperative to unravel the molecular interactions that essentially organize the dynamical events of amyloidogenesis. We have proposed a generic computational modeling framework to elucidate the important molecular events that govern the dynamics of amyloid formation. Our model reconciles diverse set of experimental observations including different mutant phenotyes from a dynamical perspective, and predicts possible ways to control the kinetics of amyloid formation experimentally. In future, these insights will be helpful to design drugs to treat patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, our model, in general, will be quite useful to figure out the important molecular events that are orchestrating the amyloidogenesis of different amyloid forming proteins.","NA"

Besides carrying out this key plasma membrane function, PLC{beta}1 has a cytosolic population that helps, in part, to drive the differentiation of PC12 cells by inhibiting a nuclease that promotes RNA-induced silencing (C3PO). Here, we show that down-regulating PLC{beta}1 or reducing its cytosolic population by activating Gq to drive it to the plasma membrane, returns differentiated PC12 cells to an undifferentiated state. In this state, the cells return to a spherical morphology, resume proliferation and express the stem cell transcription factors nanog and Oct4. Similar changes are seen with C3PO down-regulation. This return to a stem-like state is accompanied by shifts in multiple miR populations, such as increased levels of rno-miR-21 and rno-miR-26a. Surprisingly, we find that de-differentiation can also be induced by extended stimulation of the Gq. In this case, the neurites completely retract over a 10-minute period, and while levels of nanog remain unchanged, the levels of some miRs begin to return to their undifferentiated values. In complementary studies, we followed the real time hydrolysis of a fluorescent-tagged miR in cells where PLC{beta}1 or C3PO were down-regulated.

To examine the fundamental mechanisms of this self-organization process, we build a two-dimensional model in which the hydrodynamic coupling between cilia is provided by a streamwise-alignment rule governing the local orientation of the ciliary forcing. The model reproduces the emergence of the mucus swirls observed in the experiments. The predicted swirl sizes, which scale with the ciliary density and mucus viscosity, are in agreement with in-vitro measurements. A transition from the swirly regime to a long-range unidirectional mucus flow allowing effective clearance occurs at high ciliary density and high mucus viscosity. In the latter case, the mucus flow tends to spontaneously align with the bronchus axis due to hydrodynamic effects.","NA"

Cells are thought to dramatically up-regulate the levels of heat shock proteins during periods of cellular stress via induction of the heat shock response (HSR). Heat shock proteins are well-characterised molecular chaperones that interact with aggregation-prone proteins to either stabilise, refold, or traffic protein for degradation. The reason why heat shock proteins are unable to maintain the solubility of particular proteins in neurodegenerative disease is unknown. We sought to determine whether neurodegenerative disease-associated protein aggregates can induce the HSR. Here, we generated a neuroblastoma cell line that expresses a fluorescent reporter under conditions of HSR induction, for example heat shock. Using these cells, we show that the HSR is not induced by exogenous treatment with aggregated forms of Parkinsons disease-associated -synuclein or the ALS-associated G93A mutant of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1G93A). Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis revealed that intracellular expression of SOD1G93A or a pathogenic form of polyQ-expanded huntingtin (Htt72Q), similarly, results in no or low induction of the HSR. In contrast, expression of a non-pathogenic but aggregation-prone form of firefly luciferase (Fluc) did induce an HSR in a significantly greater proportion of cells. Finally, we show that HSR induction is dependent on the intracellular levels of the aggregation-prone proteins, but the pathogenic proteins (SOD1G93A and Htt72Q) elicit a significantly lower HSR compared to the non-pathogenic proteins (Fluc). These results suggest that pathogenic proteins either evade detection or impair induction of the HSR in neuronal-like cells. Therefore, defective HSR induction may facilitate the initiation of protein aggregation leading to inclusion formation in neurodegenerative diseases.","NA"

The lipid-specific QD labeling method described in this study provides a handy and practical tool to readily ""see"" the viruses and follow their infection, facilitating the widespread use of single-virus tracking and the uncovering of complex infection mechanisms.

Author summaryVirus infection in host cells is a complex process comprising a large number of dynamic molecular events. Single-virus tracking is a versatile technique to study these events. To perform this technique, viruses must be fluorescently labeled to be visible to fluorescence microscopes. Quantum dot is a kind of fluorescent tags that has many unique optical properties. It has been widely used to label proteins in single-molecule tracking studies, but rarely used to study virus infection, mainly due to lack of accepted labeling method. In this study, we developed a lipid-specific method to readily, mildly, specifically, and efficiently label enveloped viruses with quantum dots by recognizing viral envelope lipids with lipid-biotin conjugates and recognizing these lipid-biotin conjugates with streptavidin-quantum dot conjugates. Such a method is superior to the commonly used DiD/DiO labeling and the other QD labeling methods. It is not only applicable to normal viruses, but also competent to label the key protein-mutated viruses and the inactivated high virulent viruses, providing a powerful tool for single-virus tracking.","NA"

Increasing evidence suggests that post-translational modifications play critical roles in regulating Tau normal functions and its pathogenic properties in Tauopathies. Very little is known about how phosphorylation of tyrosine residues influences the structure, aggregation, and microtubule- and lipid-binding properties of Tau. In this work, we aimed to address this knowledge gap and determine the relative contribution of phosphorylation of one or several of the five tyrosine residues in Tau (Y18, Y29, Y197, Y310 and Y394) to the regulation of its biophysical, aggregation and functional properties. Towards this goal, we used a combination of site-specific mutagenesis and in vitro phosphorylation by c-Abl kinase to generate Tau species phosphorylated at all tyrosine residues, all tyrosine residues except Y310 or Y394 (pTau-Y310F, pTau-Y394F) and Tau phosphorylated only at Y310 or Y394 (4F\pY310 or 4F\pY394). Our results show that phosphorylation at all five tyrosine residues, multiple N-terminal tyrosine residues (Y18, Y29 and Y197) or site-specific phosphorylation at residue Y310, itself located in the microtubule-binding and aggregation-prone domain of Tau, was sufficient to abolish Tau aggregation and inhibit its microtubule- and lipid-binding properties. NMR studies demonstrated that these effects were mediated by a local decrease in {beta}-sheet propensity of the PHF6 domain. Our findings underscore the unique role of Y310 phosphorylation in the regulation of Tau aggregation, microtubule and lipid interactions and highlight the importance of conducting further studies to elucidate its role in the regulation of Tau normal functions and its pathogenic properties.","NA"

However, due to the time-consuming and high cost constraints of biological experimental methods, traditional drug target identification technologies are often difficult to develop on a large scale. Therefore, in silico methods are urgently needed to predict drug-target interactions in a genome-wide manner. In this article, we design a new in silico approach, named RFDTI to predict the DTIs combine Feature weighted Rotation Forest (FwRF) classifier with protein amino acids information. This model has two outstanding advantages: a) using the fusion data of protein sequence and drug molecular fingerprint, which can fully carry information; b) using the classifier with feature selection ability, which can effectively remove noise information and improve prediction performance. More specifically, we first use Position-Specific Score Matrix (PSSM) to numerically convert protein sequences and utilize Pseudo Position-Specific Score Matrix (PsePSSM) to extract their features. Then a unified digital descriptor is formed by combining molecular fingerprints representing drug information. Finally, the FwRF is applied to implement on Enzyme, Ion Channel, GPCR, and Nuclear Receptor data sets. The results of the five-fold cross-validation experiment show that the prediction accuracy of this approach reaches 91.68%, 88.11%, 84.72% and 78.33% on four benchmark data sets, respectively. To further validate the performance of the RFDTI, we compare it with other excellent methods and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. In addition, 7 of the 10 highest predictive scores in predicting novel DTIs were validated by relevant databases. The experimental results of cross-validation indicated that RFDTI is feasible in predicting the relationship among drugs and target, and can provide help for the discovery of new candidate drugs.","NA"

Mechanical forces can refine this genetic information by a feedback loop, however the direct implication of mechanical forces in morphogenesis robustness has never been reported.

Here, we show that a bias in force propagation ensures stereotyped morphogenesis in a mechanically noisy environment.

We found that knockdown of the Arp2/3 complex member Arpc5 specifically affects fold directionality without altering the developmental or the force patterns. By combining in silico modeling, biophysical and ad hoc genetic tools, our data reveal that Myosin II planar polarity favors long-range transmission of forces and avoid force scattering, thus ensuring folding robustness by isolating the fold domain from surrounding mechanical perturbations.

We explore this idea through the Sir Philip Sidney game in detail and show that some degree of inattention is always weakly better for the receiver, and may be strictly better. Moreover, some inattention may be a Pareto improvement and leave the sender no worse off.

Several groups have been studying the roles of the innate and adaptive immune systems in F. pedrosoi infection; however, few studies have focused on the role of neutrophils in this infection. In the current study, we verified the importance of murine neutrophils in the killing of F. pedrosoi conidia and hyphae. We demonstrate that phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species during infection with conidia are TLR-2 and TLR-4-dependent and are essentials for conidial killing. Meanwhile, hyphal killing occurs by NETs formation, in a TLR-2, TLR-4 and ROS-independent manner. In vivo experiments showed that TLR-2 and TLR-4 are also important in Chromoblastomycosis infection. TLR-2KO and TLR-4KO animals had lower levels of MIP-2 and KC chemokines and impaired neutrophil migration to the infected site. These animals also had higher fungal loads during infection with F. pedrosoi conidia, confirming that TLR-2 and TLR-4 are essential receptors for F. pedrosoi recognition and immune system activation. Therefore, this study demonstrated for the first time that neutrophils activation during F. pedrosoi is conidial or hyphal-specific, with TLR-2 and TLR-4 being essential during conidial infection but unnecessary for hyphal killing by neutrophils

Author SummaryChromoblastomycosis (CBM) is a chronic and progressive subcutaneous mycosis that affects mainly low-income individuals, such as farm workers. CBM have been diagnosed all over the world, but the majority of cases were diagnosed in tropical and subtropical climate countries. The treatment is difficult and involves the combination of antifungal prescriptions, cryo/heat-therapy and, in some cases, surgery to remove all the infected tissue. The treatment is long (at least 6 months) and expensive, leading to a high rate of treatment dropout and disease relapse. However, the understanding of pathogen-host interaction is far from being elucitaded. Our understanding is that this pathogen-host interaction in CBM needs to be uncovered so a different and more effective treatment could be proposed to help those patients that are struggling against this chronic infection. Therefore, our study shed a light in neutrophils and innate immune response against this fungal infection, showing the neutrophils capacity to kill Fonsecaea pedrosoi conidia and hifa, showing the importance of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 in the neutrophil fungicidal capacity against F. pedrosoi conidia but not hyphae. Therefore this work help to the better understanding of how our organism fights back in the CBM infection.","NA"

SORL1 is expressed in neurons and glia of the central nervous system and loss of SORL1 has been reported in AD tissue. To model the causal loss-of-function mutations, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to deplete SORL1 in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to test the hypothesis that loss of SORL1 contributes to AD pathogenesis by leading to endosome dysfunction. We report that loss of SORL1 in hiPSC-derived neurons leads to early endosome enlargement, a cellular phenotype that is indicative of  traffic jams and is now considered a hallmark cytopathology AD. We validate defects in neuronal endosomal traffic by showing decreased localization of amyloid-precursor protein (APP) in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and increased localization of APP in early endosomes, a site of APP cleavage by the {beta} secretase BACE1. Microglia, immune cells of the CNS, which play a role in AD pathology also express SORL1. We therefore tested and found no effect of SORL1 depletion on endosome size or morphology in hiPSC-derived microglia, suggesting a selective effect on neuronal endosomal trafficking. Finally, because BACE1 dependent APP fragments can cause endosome enlargement, we treated SORL1 deficient hiPSC-derived neurons with BACE1 inhibitors and demonstrate that endosome enlargement occurs independent of amyloidogenic APP fragments. Collectively, these findings clarify where and how SORL1 links to AD. Moreover, our data, together with recent findings, underscores how sporadic AD pathways that regulate endosomal trafficking, and autosomal-dominant AD pathways that regulate APP cleavage, independently converge on the defining cytopathology of AD.","NA"

We previously reported that copper in liquid form is a promising candidate due to its potent larvicide properties in a laboratory setting and even in the field. In the field study, several larvae survived in the ovitrap due to the dilution of copper concentration by the rain. The surviving larvae were smaller and less motile. This led our interest to study the effect of a sub-lethal dose of copper in ovitrap on larvae development, pupation time and lifespan in the adult stage.

MethodsFirst instar larvae of three species of mosquito (Aedes albopictus, Culex pipiens and Anopheles stephensi) were bred in copper-treated water at a concentration of 0.60 ppm, 0.30 ppm, and 0.15 ppm and compared with the control group. The surviving larvae were recorded every day in terms of pupa emerging time and adult emerging time. The number of adult mortality was recorded and compared with the control.

ResultsCopper showed potent larvicide effect in the 0.60 ppm concentration and prolonged pupation time and caused a significantly lower number of emerging mosquitoes down to the lowest concentration of 0.15 ppm. The adult lifespan was not different compared to the control.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates the capability of copper below 1 ppm to prolong the pupation time and the emerging time of mosquito larvae. Our findings open the possibility of copper application to cut mosquito breeding capacity that eventually will reduce disease transmission.","NA"

This technique requires complex sample preparation that can lead to artifacts like shrinkage or hole formation. We present a preparation method that reduces artifacts significantly. Here, the final drying step that is typically performed by critical point drying is replaced by hexamethyldisilazane drying. We quantitatively investigated sample integrity after both preparation methods, and show that there are significant advantages of hexamethyldisilazane drying compared to critical point drying. Furthermore, automated analysis of a network is classically performed by thresholding-based software programs, which are sensitive to noise and uneven brightness of images. The here presented analysis that we have developed is based on a vectorial node algorithm. It reproduces all kinds of networks sufficiently to allow derivation of quantitative network-specific parameters, such as mesh hole size. We use this analysis to compare the network structure of cells prepared by these two drying methods, and show that hexamethyldisilazane drying leads to fewer artificial mesh holes compared to critical point drying. We thus present here a significantly improved method to quantitatively investigate the actin cortex of cells, and show that hexamethyldisilazane drying leads to more accurate imaging compared to critical point drying.

Inhibiting both glutaminases significantly delays tumourigenesis but does not completely block glutamine catabolism through the Krebs cycle. We reveal that glutamine catabolism is then driven by amidotransferases. Consistently, the synergistic effect of glutaminase and amidotransferase inhibitors on proliferation of mouse and human tumour cells is observed in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, when Gls1 is deleted the Krebs cycle activity and tumour formation can also be significantly affected if glycolysis is co-inhibited (Gls1KO/Hk2KO). Finally, the inhibition of either serine (Psat1KO) or fatty acid (FasnKO) biosynthesis can be compensated by uptake of circulating nutrients. Thus, removing these nutrients from the diet produces synergistic effects on suppression of tumourigenesis.

We employed Target Enrichment sequence data from about 600 nuclear genes and coalescent-based species tree inference methods to resolve phylogenetic relationships among the sexual taxa of the complex. We estimated absolute divergence times and, using ancestral range reconstruction, we tested if speciation was rather enhanced by vicariance or dispersal processes.

Phylogenetic relationships among taxa were fully resolved. Incongruence among species trees mainly concerned the intraspecific relationships in R. notabilis s.l., R. cassubicifolius s.l., and the position of the tetraploid R. marsicus. Speciation events took place in a very short time at the end of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (830-580 ka). A second wave of intraspecific geographical differentiation within and around the European mountain systems happened between 200-100 ka. Ancestral range reconstruction supports the existence of a widespread European ancestor of the R. auricomus complex. Vicariance processes have triggered allopatric speciation in temperate-montane plant species during the climatic deterioration occurred in the last phase of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition.

The effect size of ABCG2 rs2231142 on urate is [~]60% that of SLC2A9, yet the effect size on gout is greater. We tested the hypothesis that ABCG2 plays a role in the progression from HU to gout by testing for association of ABCG2 rs2231142 and rs10011796 with gout using HU controls.

MethodsWe analysed 1,699 European gout cases and 14,350 normourciemic (NU) and HU controls, and 912 New Zealand (NZ) Polynesian (divided into Eastern and Western Polynesian) gout cases and 696 controls. Association testing was performed using logistic and linear regression with multivariate adjusting for confounding variables.

ResultsIn Europeans and Polynesians, the ABCG2 141K (T) allele was associated with gout using HU controls (OR=1.85, P=3.8E-21 and ORmeta =1.85, P=1.3E-03, respectively). There was evidence for an effect of 141K in determining HU in European (OR=1.56, P=1.7E-18) but not in Polynesian (ORmeta=1.49, P=0.057). For SLC2A9 rs11942223, the T allele associated with gout in the presence of HU in European (OR=1.37, P=4.7E-06), however significantly weaker than ABCG2 rs2231142 141K (PHet=0.0023). In Western Polynesian and European, there was epistatic interaction between ABCG2 rs2231142 and the genetically-independent rs10011796. Combining the presence of the 141K allele with the rs10011796 CC-genotype increased gout risk, in the presence of HU, 21.5-fold in Western Polynesian (P=0.009) and 2.6-fold in European (P=9.9E-06). The 141K allele positively associated with flare frequency in Polynesian (Pmeta =2.5E-03).

ConclusionThese data are consistent with a role for ABCG2 141K in gout in the presence of established HU.","NA"

However, genome-wide sequence variant information is limited for this species. To empower trait analyses, a new cat genome reference assembly was developed from PacBio long sequence reads that significantly improve sequence representation and assembly contiguity. The whole genome sequences of 54 domestic cats were aligned to the reference to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and structural variants (SVs). Across all cats, 16 SNVs predicted to have deleterious impacts and in a singleton state were identified as high priority candidates for causative mutations. One candidate was a stop gain in the tumor suppressor FBXW7. The SNV is found in cats segregating for feline mediastinal lymphoma and is a candidate for inherited cancer susceptibility. SV analysis revealed a complex deletion coupled with a nearby potential duplication event that was shared privately across three unrelated dwarfism cats and is found within a known dwarfism associated region on cat chromosome B1. This SV interrupted UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH), a gene involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans. Importantly, UGDH has not yet been associated with human dwarfism and should be screened in undiagnosed patients. The new high-quality cat genome reference and the compilation of sequence variation demonstrate the importance of these resources when searching for disease causative alleles in the domestic cat and for identification of feline biomedical models.

Author summaryThe practice of genomic medicine is predicated on the availability of a high quality reference genome and an understanding of the impact of genome variation. Such resources have lead to countless discoveries in humans, however by working exclusively within the framework of human genetics, our potential for understanding diseases biology is limited, as similar analyses in other species have often lead to novel insights. The generation of Felis_catus_9.0, a new high quality reference genome for the domestic cat, helps facilitate the expansion of genomic medicine into the felis lineage. Using Felis_catus_9.0 we analyze the landscape of genomic variation from a collection of 54 cats within the context of human gene constraint. The distribution of variant impacts in cats is correlated with patterns of gene constraint in humans, indicating the utility of this reference for identifying novel mutations that cause phenotypes relevant to human and cat health. Moreover, structural variant analysis revealed a novel variant for feline dwarfism in UGDH, a gene that has not been associated with dwarfism in any other species, suggesting a role for UGDH in cases of undiagnosed dwarfism in humans.","NA"

McCoy","Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University","2020-01-07",1,"cc_by_nd","new results","genomics","Less than half of human zygotes survive to live birth, primarily due to aneuploidies of meiotic or mitotic origin. Mitotic errors lead to chromosomal mosaicism, defined by multiple cell lineages with distinct chromosome complements. The incidence and fitness consequences of chromosomal mosaicism in human embryos remain controversial, with most previous studies based on bulk DNA assays or comparisons of multiple biopsies of a few embryonic cells. Single-cell genomic data provide an opportunity to quantify mosaicism on an embryo-wide scale. To this end, we extended an approach to infer aneuploidies based on chromosome dosage-associated changes in gene expression by integrating signatures of allelic imbalance. We applied this method to published single-cell RNA sequencing data from 74 disaggregated human embryos, spanning the morula to blastocyst stages. Our analysis revealed widespread mosaic aneuploidies across preimplantation development, with 59 of 74 (80%) embryos harboring at least one aneuploid cell (1% FDR). By clustering copy number calls, we reconstructed histories of chromosome mis-segregation, distinguishing meiotic and early mitotic errors from those occurring after lineage differentiation. We observed no significant enrichment of aneuploid cells in the trophectoderm compared to the inner cell mass, though we do detect such an enrichment in published data from later post-implantation stages. Finally, we observed that aneuploid cells exhibit upregulation of immune response genes, as well as downregulation of genes involved in proliferation, metabolism, and protein processing, consistent with stress responses previously documented in other stages and systems. Together, our work provides a high-resolution view of aneuploidy in preimplantation embryos and supports the conclusion that low-level mosaicism is a common feature of early human development.","NA"

In autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), the presence of anti-Soluble Liver Antigen (SLA or SepSecs) autoantibodies is associated with significantly reduced overall survival, but the associated autoreactive CD4 T cells have not been characterized yet. Here we isolated and deeply characterized SLA-specific CD4 T cells in AIH patients.

MethodsWe used brief ex vivo restimulation with overlapping SLA-derived peptides to isolate and phenotype circulating SLA-specific CD4 T cells, and integrative single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to characterize their transcriptome and TCR repertoire in n=5 AIH patients. SLA-specific CD4 T cells were tracked in peripheral blood through TCR sequencing, to identify their phenotypic niche. We further characterized disease-associated peripheral blood T cells by high content flow cytometry in an additional cohort of n=46 AIH patients and n=18 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) controls.

ResultsAutoreactive SLA-specific CD4 T cells were only detected in patients with anti-SLA autoantibodies and had a memory PD-1+CXCR5-CCR6-CD27+ phenotype. ScRNA-seq revealed their pro-inflammatory/B-Helper profile (IL21, IFNG, TIGIT, CTLA4, NR3C1, CD109, KLRB1 and CLEC2D). Autoreactive TCR clonotypes were restricted to the memory PD-1+CXCR5- CD4 T cells. This subset was significantly increased in the blood of AIH patients and supported B cell differentiation through IL-21. Finally, we identified a specific phenotype (PD-1+CD38+CD27+CD127-CXCR5-) of CD4 T cells linked to disease activity and IgG response during AIH.

ConclusionsThis work provides for the first time a deep characterization of rare circulating autoreactive CD4 T cells and the identification of their peripheral reservoir in AIH. We also propose a generic phenotype of pathogenic CD4 T cells related to AIH disease activity.","NA"

Here, using a forward genetic approach in the model organism Neurospora crassa, we identified two alleles of a gene, NCU04278, encoding an unknown PRC2 accessory subunit (PAS). Loss of PAS resulted in losses of H3K27 methylation concentrated near the chromosome ends and derepression of a subset of associated subtelomeric genes.

In addition to enabling the visualization of the profiled cells, such representations are used by many downstream analyses methods ranging from pseudo-time reconstruction to clustering to alignment of scRNA-seq data from different experiments, platforms, and labs. Both supervised and unsupervised methods have been proposed to reduce the dimension of scRNA-seq. However, all methods to date are sensitive to batch effects. When batches correlate with cell types, as is often the case, their impact can lead to representations that are batch rather than cell type specific. To overcome this we developed a domain adversarial neural network model for learning a reduced dimension representation of scRNA-seq data. The adversarial model tries to simultaneously optimize two objectives. The first is the accuracy of cell type assignment and the second is the inability to distinguish the batch (domain). We tested the method by using the resulting representation to align several different datasets. As we show, by overcoming batch effects our method was able to correctly separate cell types, improving on several prior methods suggested for this task. Analysis of the top features used by the network indicates that by taking the batch impact into account, the reduced representation is much better able to focus on key genes for each cell type.","NA"

Recent work has shown that genomic insertion of short identification tags, called ""barcodes"" here, allows detection of chromosomally tagged strains by real-time PCR. Manual design of these barcodes is feasible for small sets, but expansion of the technique to larger pools of distinct and well-functioning assays would be significantly aided by software-guided design.

ResultsHere we introduce barCoder, a bioinformatics tool that facilitates the process of creating sets of uniquely identifiable barcoded strains. barCoder utilizes the genomic sequence of the target strain and a set of user-specified PCR parameters to generate a list of suggested barcode ""modules"" that consist of binding sites for primers and probes and appropriate spacer sequences. Each module is designed to yield optimal PCR amplification and unique identification. Optimal amplification includes metrics such as ideal Tm and G+C-content, appropriate spacing, and minimal stem-loop formation; unique identification includes low BLAST hits against the target organism, previously generated barcode modules, and databases, such as NCBI. We tested the ability of our algorithm to suggest appropriate barcodes by generating 12 modules for Bacillus thuringiensis serovar kurstaki, a simulant for the potential biowarfare agent Bacillus anthracis, and three each for other potential target organisms with variable G+C content. Real-time PCR detection assays directed at barcodes were specific and yielded minimal cross-reactivity with a panel of near-neighbor and potential contaminant materials.

ConclusionsThe barCoder algorithm facilitates the generation of barcoded biological simulants by (a) eliminating the task of creating modules by hand, (b) minimizing optimization of PCR assays, and (c) reducing effort wasted on non-unique barcode modules.","NA"

We show that RNF125 exhibits nuclear expression in acinar cells, with reduced and largely cytosolic expression in ductal cells, PanIN and PDA specimens. We find that RNF125 interacts with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and promotes its non-canonical K63-linked ubiquitination. Inhibition of HDAC2 activity by RNF125 resulted in elevated expression of the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1). Correspondingly, inhibition of RNF125 expression enhanced organoid growth in culture and orthotopic tumor development. Conversely, restoration of PDX1 levels in human or mouse PDA cells and organoids depleted of RNF125, inhibited cell proliferation and growth, while expression of HDAC2 enhanced it. Notably, higher expression of RNF125 and PDX1 coincided with differentiated tumor phenotypes, and better outcome in PDA patients. In demonstrating the importance of RNF125 control of PDX1 expression via HDAC2 ubiquitination in PDA development, our findings highlight markers (RNF125, PDX1) and targets (HDAC2) for monitoring and possible treatment of PDA.","NA"

But metaxin 3 is absent. The predicted proteins of the invertebrate metaxins were initially identified by homology with human metaxin 1 and 2 proteins, and by the presence of characteristic GST_Metaxin protein domains. Invertebrate metaxins were revealed for a variety of phyla, including Echinodermata, Cnidaria, Porifera, Chordata, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Brachiopoda, Placozoa, and Nematoda. Metaxins were also found in insects (Arthropoda) of different taxonomic orders: Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Blattodea. Invertebrate and human metaxin 1 proteins have about 41% identical amino acids, while metaxin 2 proteins have about 49% identities. Invertebrate and vertebrate metaxins share the same characteristic protein domains, further strengthening the identification of the invertebrate proteins as metaxins. The domains are, for metaxin 1, GST_N_Metaxin1_like, GST_C_Metaxin1_3, and Tom37. For metaxin 2, they are GST_N_Metaxin2, GST_C_Metaxin2, and Tom37. Phylogenetic trees show that invertebrate metaxin 1 and metaxin 2 proteins are related, but form separate groups. The invertebrate proteins are also closely related to vertebrate metaxins, though forming separate clusters. These phylogenetic results indicate that all metaxins likely arose from a common ancestral sequence. The neighboring genes of the invertebrate metaxin 1 and 2 genes are largely different for different invertebrate species. This is unlike the situation with vertebrate metaxin genes, where, for example, the metaxin 1 gene is adjacent to the thrombospondin 3 gene. The dominant secondary structures predicted for the invertebrate metaxins are alpha-helical segments, with little beta-strand. The conserved pattern of helical segments is the same as that found for vertebrate metaxins 1, 2, and 3.","NA"

Metabolic networks are highly redundant and it is possible to minimise the metabolic networks into smaller networks that retain the functionality of the original network. Here, we establish a new method, MO_SCPLOWINC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEACTC_SCPLOW that systematically removes reactions from a given network to identify minimal reactome(s). We show that our method identifies smaller minimal reactomes than existing methods and also scales well to larger metabolic networks. Notably, our method exploits known aspects of network structure and redundancy to identify multiple minimal metabolic networks. We illustrate the utility of MO_SCPLOWINC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEACTC_SCPLOW by identifying multiple minimal networks for 74 organisms from the BiGG database. We show that these multiple minimal reactomes arise due to the presence of compensatory reactions/pathways. We further employed MO_SCPLOWINC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEACTC_SCPLOW for a case study to identify the minimal reactomes of different organisms in both glucose and xylose minimal environments. Identification of minimal reactomes of these different organisms elucidate that they exhibit varying levels of redundancy. A comparison of the minimal reactomes on glucose and xylose illustrate that the differences in the reactions required to sustain growth on either medium. Overall, our algorithm provides a rapid and reliable way to identify minimal subsets of reactions that are essential for survival, in a systematic manner.

Author summaryAn organisms metabolism is routinely modelled by a metabolic network, which consists of all the enzyme-catalysed reactions that occur in the organism. These reactions are numerous, majorly due to the presence of redundant reactions that perform compensatory functions. Also, not all the reactions are functional in all environments and are unique to the environmental conditions. So, it is possible to minimise such large metabolic networks into smaller functional networks. Such minimal networks help in easier dissection of the capabilities of the network and also further our understanding of the various redundancies and other design principles occurring in these networks. Here, we have developed a new algorithm for identification of such minimal networks, that is efficient and superior to existing algorithms. We show the utility of our algorithm in identifying such minimal sets of reactions for many known metabolic networks. We have also shown a case study, using our algorithm to identify such minimal networks for different organisms in varied nutrient conditions.","NA"

A better understanding of risk factors associated with canine weight is fundamental to identifying preventative interventions and treatments. In this cross-sectional study, we used a direct to consumer approach to collect body condition scores (BCS), as well as demographic, diet, and lifestyle data on 4,446 dogs. BCS was assessed by owners using a 9-point system and categorized as ideal (BCS 4-5), overweight (BCS 6), and obese (BCS 7+). Following univariate analyses, a stepwise procedure was used to select variables which were included in multivariate logistic regression models. One model was created to compare ideal to all overweight and obese dogs, and another was created to compare ideal to obese dogs only. We then used Elastic Net selection and XGBoost variable importance measures to validate these results.

ResultsOverall, 1,480 (33%) of dogs were reported to be overweight or obese, of which 356 (8% total) of dogs were reported to be obese. Seven factors were significantly associated with both overweightness/obesity and obesity alone in all three analyses (stepwise, Elastic Net, and XGBoost): diet composition, probiotic supplementation, treat quantity, exercise, age, food motivation level, and pet appetite. Neutering was also associated with overweightness/obesity in all analyses.

ConclusionsThis study recapitulated established risk factors associated with BCS (age, exercise, neutering). Moreover, we elucidated associations between previously examined risk factors and BCS (diet composition, treat consumption, and temperament) and identified a novel factor (probiotic supplementation). Specifically, relative to dogs on fresh food diets, BCS was higher in dogs eating dry food both alone and in combination with other foods. Furthermore, dogs receiving probiotics, but not other forms of supplementation, were more likely to have an ideal BCS. Future studies should corroborate these findings with experimental manipulations.","NA"

A transcription factor-transcription cofactor interaction network was constructed to uncover the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of these CNV 4 GBM cells that had prognostic significance (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a sub-cluster of these CNV 4 GBM cells possessed stem cell-like properties and had tumorigenic potential. In parallel, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from four patients with GBM, three patients with epilepsy and three healthy volunteers by scRNA-seq. We identified a novel subtype of proliferative immune cells only in patients with GBM. Overall, our findings indicate that CNV 4 cells might contribute to GBM recurrence and proliferative circulating immune cells are specific to patients with GBM. This study sheds light on a neglected aspect of GBM, and opens new avenues to explore GBM recurrence and immunotherapy.

SignificanceWe show that a subset of GBM cells outside the C region possess the properties of stem cell and tumorigenesis potential, which might be responsible for cancer recurrence. Besides, proliferative lymphocytes are specific to the PBMCs of patients with GBM, which could help to develop novel immunotherapy.","NA"

An initial phylogenetic study of isolates from Japan, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and Venezuela revealed four populations (Clades I, II, III, and IV) corresponding to these geographic regions. Since this description, C. auris has been reported in over 30 additional countries. To trace this global emergence, we compared the genomes of 304 C. auris isolates from 19 countries on six continents. We found that four predominant clades persist across wide geographic locations. We observed phylogeographic mixing in most clades; Clade IV, with isolates mainly from South America, demonstrated the strongest phylogeographic substructure. C. auris isolates from two clades with opposite mating types were detected contemporaneously in a single healthcare facility in Kenya. We estimated a Bayesian molecular clock phylogeny and dated the origin of each clade within the last 339 years; outbreak-causing clusters from Clades I, III, and IV originated 34-35 years ago. We observed high rates of antifungal resistance in Clade I, including four isolates resistant to all three major classes of antifungals. Mutations that contribute to resistance varied between the clades, with Y132F in ERG11 as the most widespread mutation associated with azole resistance and S639P in FKS1 for echinocandin resistance. Copy number variants in ERG11 predominantly appeared in Clade III and were associated with fluconazole resistance. These results provide a global context for the phylogeography, population structure, and mechanisms associated with antifungal resistance in C. auris.

ImportanceIn less than a decade, C. auris has emerged in healthcare settings worldwide; this species is capable of colonizing skin and causing outbreaks of invasive candidiasis. In contrast to other Candida species, C. auris is unique in its ability to spread via nosocomial transmission and its high rates of drug resistance. As part of the public health response, whole-genome sequencing has played a major role in characterizing transmission dynamics and detecting new C. auris introductions. Through a global collaboration, we assessed genome evolution of isolates of C. auris from 19 countries. Here, we described estimated timing of the expansion of each C. auris clade and of fluconazole resistance, characterized discrete phylogeographic population structure of each clade, and compared genome data to sensitivity measurements to describe how antifungal resistance mechanisms vary across the population. These efforts are critical for a sustained, robust public health response that effectively utilizes molecular epidemiology.","NA"

A greater knowledge of the intricate cellular milieu of the heart is critical to increase our understanding of cardiac homeostasis and pathology. As recent advances in low input RNA-sequencing have allowed definitions of cellular transcriptomes at single cell resolution at scale, here we have applied these approaches to assess the cellular and transcriptional diversity of the non-failing human heart.

MethodsMicrofluidic encapsulation and barcoding was used to perform single nuclear RNA sequencing with samples from seven human donors, selected for their absence of overt cardiac disease. Individual nuclear transcriptomes were then clustered based upon transcriptional profiles of highly variable genes. These clusters were used as the basis for between-chamber and between-sex differential gene expression analyses and intersection with genetic and pharmacologic data

ResultsWe sequenced the transcriptomes of 287,269 single cardiac nuclei, revealing a total of 9 major cell types and 20 subclusters of cell types within the human heart. Cellular subclasses include two distinct groups of resident macrophages, four endothelial subtypes, and two fibroblasts subsets. Comparisons of cellular transcriptomes by cardiac chamber or sex reveal diversity not only in cardiomyocyte transcriptional programs, but also in subtypes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and vascularization. Using genetic association data, we identified strong enrichment for the role of cell subtypes in cardiac traits and diseases. Finally, intersection of our dataset with genes on cardiac clinical testing panels and the druggable genome reveals striking patterns of cellular specificity.

ConclusionsUsing large-scale single nuclei RNA sequencing, we have defined the transcriptional and cellular diversity in the normal human heart. Our identification of discrete cell subtypes and differentially expressed genes within the heart will ultimately facilitate the development of new therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases.","NA"

Here we establish ultra-clean microbial and viral sampling procedures and apply them to two ice cores from the Guliya ice cap (northwestern Tibetan Plateau, China) to study these archived communities. This method reduced intentionally contaminating bacterial, viral, and free DNA to background levels in artificial-ice-core control experiments, and was then applied to two authentic ice cores to profile their microbes and viruses. The microbes differed significantly across the two ice cores, presumably representing the very different climate conditions at the time of deposition that is similar to findings in other cores. Separately, viral particle enrichment and ultra-low-input quantitative viral metagenomic sequencing from [~]520 and [~]15,000 years old ice revealed 33 viral populations (i.e., species-level designations) that represented four known genera and likely 28 novel viral genera (assessed by gene-sharing networks). In silico host predictions linked 18 of the 33 viral populations to co-occurring abundant bacteria, including Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, and Janthinobacterium, indicating that viruses infected several abundant microbial groups. Depth-specific viral communities were observed, presumably reflecting differences in the environmental conditions among the ice samples at the time of deposition. Together, these experiments establish a clean procedure for studying microbial and viral communities in low-biomass glacier ice and provide baseline information for glacier viruses, some of which appear to be associated with the dominant microbes in these ecosystems.

Recent evidence suggests that Aurora B ensures proper chromosome segregation during mitosis not only by controlling kinetochore-microtubule attachment but also by regulating telomere and chromosome arm separation. However, whether and how Aurora-B governs telomere separation during meiosis has remained unknown. Here, we show that fission yeast Aurora B localizes at telomeres during meiosis I and promotes telomere separation independently of the meiotic cohesin Rec8. In meiosis II, Aurora-B controls kinetochore-microtubule attachment but appears dispensable for telomere and chromosome arm separation. Likewise, condensin activity is nonessential in meiosis II for telomere and chromosome arm separation. Thus, in meiosis, the requirements for Aurora-B are distinct at centromeres and telomeres, illustrating the critical differences in the control of chromosome segregation between mitosis and meiosis II.","NA"

Impaired mitophagy is a key causative pathway in familial PD, but its relevance to idiopathic PD is unclear. We used a mitophagy screening assay to evaluate the functional significance of risk genes identified through GWAS. We identified two new regulators of PINK1-mitophagy, KAT8 and KANSL1, previously shown to modulate lysine acetylation. These findings establish PINK1-mitophagy as a contributing factor to idiopathic PD. KANSL1 is located on chromosome 17q21 where the risk associated gene has long been considered to be MAPT.

The triterpenoids substantially affected biofilm associated attributes like formation, substratum adherence and dispersion from preformed biofilms. Though at variable degree, the compounds decreased cell surface hydrophobicity and composition in terms of macromolecular content. Not only EPS-associated extracellular enzyme activities were estimated to be reduced by triterpenoid exposure, ultra structural analysis also revealed that GRA, UA and BA can affect extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content.

Successful evaluation of candidate therapeutics will be facilitated by validated noninvasive biomarkers of aspects of disease pathology recapitulated by animal models.

ObjectiveWe sought to identify shared neurochemical signatures in two mouse models of SCA3 that reflect aspects of the human disease pathology.

MethodsCerebellar neurochemical concentrations in homozygous YACMJD84.2 (Q84/Q84) and hemizygous CMVMJD135 (Q135) mice were measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 9.4 tesla. Motivated by the shared neurochemical abnormalities in the two models, we determined the levels of neurofilament medium (NFL, indicator of neuroaxonal integrity) and myelin basic protein (MBP, indicator of myelination) in cerebellar lysates from a subset of mice and from patients with SCA3. Finally, NFL and MBP levels were measured in cerebellar extracts of Q84/Q84 mice upon sustained silencing of the mutant ATXN3 gene from 6-8 weeks-of-age until death.

ResultsBoth Q84/Q84 and Q135 mice displayed lower N-acetylaspartate than wild-type littermates, indicating neuroaxonal loss/dysfunction, and lower myo-inositol and total choline, indicating disturbances in phospholipid membrane metabolism and demyelination. Cerebellar NFL and MBP levels were accordingly lower in both models as well as in the cerebellar cortex of patients with SCA3 than controls. Furthermore, long-term sustained RNAi-mediated reduction of ATXN3 levels increased NFL and MBP in Q84/Q84 cerebella.

ConclusionsN-acetylaspartate, myo-inositol and total choline levels in the cerebellum are candidate biomarkers of neuroaxonal and oligodendrocyte pathology in SCA3, which are reversible by reduction of mutant ATXN3 levels.","NA"

However, the traditional method of studying sedimentary ancient DNA - metabarcoding - focuses on small fragments which cannot resolve Larix to species level nor allow the detailed study of population dynamics. Here we use shotgun sequencing and hybridization capture with long-range PCR-generated baits covering the complete Larix chloroplast genome to study Larix populations from a sediment core reaching back up to 6700 years in age from the Taymyr region in northern Siberia. In comparison to shotgun sequencing, hybridization capture results in an increase of taxonomically classified reads by several orders of magnitude and the recovery of near-complete chloroplast genomes of Larix. Variation in the chloroplast reads corroborate an invasion of Larix gmelinii into the range of Larix sibirica before 6700 years ago.

Recently, free-water (FW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown associations with pathology in Alzheimers disease (AD), but it is still unclear whether these metrics are associated with measures of cognitive impairment. Here, we investigate whether FW and FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAT) within medial temporal lobe white matter tracts (cingulum, fornix, uncinate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and tapetum) provides meaningful contribution to cognition and cognitive decline beyond hippocampal volume.

Participants and MethodsVanderbilt Memory & Aging Project participants (n=319, 73{+/-}7 years, 59% male) with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (40% of cohort) underwent baseline brain MRI, including structural MRI to quantify hippocampal volume, diffusion MRI to quantify medial temporal lobe white matter tract FW and FAT, and longitudinal neuropsychological assessment with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years. Linear regressions were conducted to determine how hippocampal volume and white matter tract FW and FAT interact with baseline memory and executive function performances. Competitive model analyses determined the unique variance provided by white matter tract FW and FAT beyond that of hippocampal volume and other comorbidities. Linear mixed-effects models were conducted to determine how baseline hippocampal volume and white matter tract FW and FAT interact to explain longitudinal change in memory and executive function performances.

ResultsFW in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, tapetum, uncinate fasciculus, and cingulum were robustly associated with baseline memory and executive function. Further, competitive model analysis showed that tract FW contributed unique variance beyond other comorbidities and hippocampal volume for memory ({Delta}Radj2 range: 0.82-2.00%) and executive function ({Delta}Radj2 range: 0.88-1.87%). Longitudinal analyses demonstrated significant interactions of hippocampal volume and FAT in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (p=0.02), tapetum (p=0.02), uncinate fasciculus (p=0.02), and cingulum (p=0.002) with decline in memory. For decline in executive function, we found significant interactions of hippocampal volume and FAT in inferior longitudinal fasciculus (p=0.03), tapetum (p=0.02), uncinate fasciculus (p=0.02), and fornix (p=0.02), as well as cingulum (p=0.02) and fornix (p=0.02) FW.

ConclusionsOur results highlight novel associations between FW and FAT measures of medial temporal lobe tract microstructure and cognitive performance such that individuals with smaller hippocampal volumes and lower tract microstructure experience greater cognitive decline. These results suggest that white matter has a unique role in cognitive decline and, therefore, could be used to provide better disease staging, allowing for more precise disease monitoring in AD.","NA"

Although cortico-motoneuronal connections have been shown to be absent or very rare in rodents2-5, it is generally assumed by analogy with primates that the main function of the CST is to convey motor commands. Yet the CST has been shown to have other functions1, such as sensory gating. By differentially filtering out sensory signals at their entry point in the spinal cord6,7, sensory gating is thought to have evolved to increase the gain of relevant feedback information during voluntary movement to improve execution of skilled movements8-10. Here we show that, unexpectedly, sensory gating is the essential function of the lumbar CST in mice while lumbar motor command mainly involves non-CST pathways. By sequentially investigating each stage of the corticofugal pathways for motor command and sensory gating, we found that they both originate in the same cortical area but follow segregated paths. The hindlimb motor command is mainly relayed through subcortical supraspinal motor centers, and is only anecdotally encoded by the CST, requiring a propiospinal relay in the upper cord. In contrast, corticospinal neurons are essential for sensory gating, and act directly through a population of lumbar interneurons. Our results reveal that the original function of the CST in mammals, still prominent in rodents, is sensory gating, not motor control. This pathway appears to have been later selected through evolution to serve other functions, such as refined motor commands, eventually yielding direct CST-to-motoneuron connection in primates. The rodent lumbar CST thus serves as a prototypical paradigm to study, in isolation, the primary role of CST in sensory gating.","NA"

Even though larvae can only rely on temporal cues in this setup, we find that they are capable of finding preferred areas of low light intensity. Further detailed analysis of their behavior reveals that larvae initiate turns more frequently and that turn amplitudes become higher when animals experience luminance increments over extended periods of time. We suggest that temporal integration of luminance change during runs is an important - and so far largely unexplored - element of phototaxis.

We propose that the association of an olfactory stimulus with its multisensory context is mediated by projections from ventral hippocampal networks (vHC) to the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON). Using a contextually-cued olfactory discrimination task, rats were trained to associate two olfactory stimuli with different responses depending on visuo-spatial context. Temporary lesions of the AON or vHC impaired performance on this task. In contrast, such lesions did not impair performance on a non-contextual olfactory discrimination task. Moreover, vHC lesions also impaired performance on an analogous contextually-cued texture discrimination task, whereas AON lesions affected only olfactory contextual associations. We describe a distinct role for the AON in olfactory processing, and conclude that early olfactory networks such as the olfactory bulb and AON function as multimodal integration networks rather than processing olfactory signals exclusively.

Significance statementContextual information has long been known to play a key role in cognitive functions such as memory and decision making. We here show the contextual modulation of neural information in early primary sensory networks and its effects on contextually conditional learned behavior. We propose that projections from ventral hippocampus to anterior olfactory nucleus convey contextual information to the early olfactory system, modulating sensory representations and olfactory perception. Using behavioral pharmacology and computational modeling, we show how established network structures can mediate multimodal information and use context to make olfactory decisions.","NA"

Here, we provide a guided tour of early developmental events in their electrophysiological context. We demonstrate the transition from developmental cells to terminally differentiated cells as being defined by functional changes that set up adult behavioral function. In a model organism such as C. elegans, this transition is developmentally conserved and well-characterized in various ways by publicly-available data. In this paper, we will build on an existing time-series model of neuronal differentiation and conduct a functional assessment of this developmental connectome. Multiple sources of data will be brought to bear on this effort, providing information about the emerging connectome as well as the emergence of functional subnetworks. A first-mover model of the emerging connectome is also introduced, which will help to synthesize the details of our results.

One of largest camera trap studies published to date is from the Serengeti National Park (SNP) in Tanzania, East Africa which deployed 225 camera traps and obtained over 1.2 million pictures. This paper will focus primarily on the top predator of the Serengeti, the lion, and how it affects and is affected by prey, subordinate predators and the dramatic shift in the seasons. I asked the following three questions to better understand species relationships in the SNP: 1) Do the seasons in the SNP have an effect on the RAB of lions? 2) Does the presence or absence of lions have an effect on the RAB of hyenas in the wet season? 3) Does the presence/absence of Thompson gazelles (Eudorcas thomsonii) and impalas (Aepyceros melampus) in the wet season have an effect on the RAB of lions? During the dry and wet season of 2012 in the SNP there did not appear to be a change in the relative abundance of lions (Fig. 1), nor did lion relative abundance affect hyenas. The lions might possibly alter their diet during the dry seasons to include non-migratory species and choose not to change their territory on a season to season basis. Based on these findings research should focus on how the lions adapt to the changes in prey abundance during the wet and dry season. This preliminary analysis of the ecological dynamics of lions and associated species in the SNP is intriguing and yet raises significantly more questions than it has answered. Additional research surrounding the effects of yearly migration on the lions home territory, diet, and species interactions should be investigated more thoroughly, to greater understand the ecological relationships in the SNP.

Lion relative abundance (RAB) is given in units of the number of events in 100 trap nights. RAB values were determined by using motion censored cameras to identify the presence of a Lion and then disregarding all sightings for a 30-minute period following initial observation. This sighting/identification was referred to as an event. The total number of events for each camera was calculated and divided by the number of trap nights the camera was operational. The value was then multiplied by 100 to give the number of events per 100 trap nights. P-value > 0.05.

J.; Griffen, A. L.","Ann L Griffen","The Ohio State University","2020-01-07",1,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","microbiology","The human oral microbiota is acquired early in an organized pattern, but the factors driving this acquisition are not well understood. Microbial ""heritability"" could have far-reaching consequences for health, yet no studies have specifically examined the fidelity with which the oral microbiota are passed from parents to offspring. Some previous studies comparing monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins had suggested that host genetics has a role in shaping oral microbial communities, and also identified so called ""heritable"" taxa. However, these findings are likely to be confounded by shared environmental factors resulting from the well-established greater behavioral similarity among MZ twins. In addition, MZ and DZ twins share an equal portion of their parents genome, and so this model is not informative for studying direct parent to offspring transmission.

To specifically examine the contribution of genetics to the fidelity of transmission of bacteria from parents to offspring, we used a novel study design comparing fraction of shared species and strains between our genetically related group consisting of children and their biological mothers, with that of children and their adoptive mothers, constituting our genetically unrelated group. Fifty-five biological and 50 adoptive mother-child pairs were recruited along with 23 biological fathers and 16 siblings. Subjects were carefully selected to ensure the two groups were matched on childs age. Three distinct habitats within the oral cavity: the saliva/soft tissue surface, supragingival biofilm, and subgingival biofilm, were sampled to comprehensively profile the oral microbiome. Our recently developed strategy for subspecies level characterization of bacterial communities by targeted sequencing of the ribosomal 16-23S intergenic spacer region (ISR) was utilized in the present study to track strain sharing between subjects, in addition to 16S rRNA gene sequencing for species analysis.

Results showed that oral bacterial community profiles of adoptive and biological mother-child pairs were equally similar, indicating no effect of host genetics on the fidelity of transmission. This was consistent at both species and strain level resolutions, and across all three habitats sampled. We also found that all children more closely resembled their own mother as compared to unrelated women, suggesting that contact and shared environment were the major factors shaping the oral microbiota. Individual analysis of the most abundant species also did not detect any effect of host genetics on strain sharing between mother and child. Mother-child strain similarity increased with the age of the child, ruling out early effects that are lost over time. No effect on the fidelity of mother-child strain sharing from vaginal birth or breast feeding was seen. Analysis of extended families showed that fathers and mothers were equally similar to their children. Cohabitating couples showed even greater strain similarity than mother-child pairs, further supporting the role of age, contact and shared environment as determinants of microbial similarity.

Based on these findings we suggest that the genetic effects on oral microbial acquisition observed in twin studies are more likely the result of confounding environmental factors based on greater behavioral similarity among MZ twins. Our findings suggest that these host mechanisms are universal to humans, since no effect of genetic relatedness on fidelity of microbial transmission could be detected. Instead, our findings point toward contact and shared environment being the driving factors of microbial transmission, with a unique combination of these factors ultimately shaping a highly personalized human oral microbiome.","NA"

In cued recall paradigms, however, participants sometimes correctly recall words in the presence of strong semantic cues but then fail to recognize those words as actually having been studied. Although the conditions necessary to produce this unusual effect are known, the underlying neural correlates have not been investigated. Across two experiments, involving both behavioral and electrophysiological methods (EEG), we investigated the cognitive and neural processes that underlie recognition failures. Experiments 1A and 1B showed that, in cued recall paradigms, presuming that recalled items can be recognized is a flawed assumption: Recognition failures occur in the presence of cues, regardless of whether those failures are measured. Experiment 2 showed that successfully recalled words that are recognized are driven by recollection at recall and by a combination of recollection and familiarity at recognition; in contrast, recognition failures are driven by semantic priming at recall and followed by negative-going ERP effects consistent with implicit processes such as repetition fluency and context familiarity at recognition. These results demonstrate that recall--long-characterized as predominantly reflecting recollection-based processing in episodic memory--can at times also be served by a confluence of implicit cognitive processes.","NA"

Such decay is exacerbated in clinical and aging populations. Low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS) to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) has potential to upregulate neural activity within the attention network, evidenced by increased activation and functional communication. Attributed to functional compensation for the inhibited node, this boost outlasts the stimulation for tens of minutes. Despite the neural change, no behavioral effect has been found in healthy subjects, a necessary direct evidence of functional compensation. To understand the functional significance of neuromodulatory induced fluctuations on sustained attention, we sought to boost the impact of LF-rTMS through controlling neural excitability prior to LF-rTMS, with the goal to impact behavior. Brain state was controlled using high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (HF-tRNS), based on the evidence that HF-tRNS increases and stabilizes neuronal excitability. In male and female human participants, we tested several fMRI-guided stimulation protocols combining HF-tRNS and LF-rTMS. Sustained attention was recorded post-stimulation via a multiple object tracking task (MOT). Whilst attention deteriorated across time in the control condition, HF-tRNS followed by LF-rTMS maintained attention performance up to 94 minutes, doubling the length of successful sustained attention. These results suggest controlling brain state can increase the impact of LF-rTMS in bilateral sustained attention. Used in a cognitive domain dependent on network-wide neural activity, this tool may be effective in causing neural compensation important for clinical rehabilitation.

Significance StatementSustained attention decreases 45 minutes after the onset of a task. Here, we prevent decrement of sustained attention for 94 minutes through applying multi-method brain stimulation. Our stimulation protocol aimed to boost sustained attention through harnessing functional compensation previously found in the attention network following low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) to the IPS, a node of the network. To date, this functional compensation has not provoked behavioral benefit. In our study, controlling brain state with high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (HF-tRNS) prior to LF-rTMS resulted in a lasting sustained attention, a crucial effect that could be beneficial to both healthy and clinical populations. Furthermore, given the feasibility of real-world application, this stimulation protocol could be employed ubiquitously to augment cognitive processes.","NA"

In this work we contribute to closing this gap, studying how physiological changes correlated with advanced age impact the computational performance of a spiking network model of primary visual cortex (V1). Our results demonstrate that deterioration of homeostatic regulation of excitatory firing, coupled with long-term synaptic plasticity, is a sufficient mechanism to reproduce features of observed physiological and functional changes in neural activity data, specifically declines in inhibition and in selectivity to oriented stimuli. This suggests a potential causality between dysregulation of neuron firing and age-induced changes in brain physiology and performance. While this does not rule out deeper underlying causes or other mechanisms that could give rise to these changes, our approach opens new avenues for exploring these underlying mechanisms in greater depth and making predictions for future experiments.","NA"

ResultsWe surveyed the fecal and sputum (as a proxy for lung) microbiota in healthy controls and NSCLC patients of various stages, and found significant perturbations of gut- and sputum-microbiota in patients with NSCLC and DM. Machine-learning models combining both microbiota (mixed models) performed better than either dataset in patient stratification, with the highest area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.842. Sputum-microbiota contributed more than the gut in the mixed models; in addition, sputum-only models performed similarly to the mixed models in most cases. Several microbial-biomarkers were shared by both microbiota, indicating their similar roles at distinct body sites. Microbial-biomarkers of distinct disease stages were mostly shared, suggesting biomarkers for distant metastasis could be acquired early. Furthermore, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a species previously associated with wound infections, was significantly more abundant in brain metastasis, indicating distinct types of DMs could have different microbial-biomarkers.

ConclusionOur results indicate that alterations of sputum-microbiota have stronger relationships with NSCLC and distant metastasis than the gut, and strongly support the feasibility of metagenome-based non-invasive disease diagnosis and risk evaluation.","NA"

Early carotenoid biosynthesis steps are well-conserved, while the identity of the enzymes that catalyze the later steps and their order remain unclear. Those steps lead to the biosynthesis of the final pathway products: the main accessory light-harvesting pigment fucoxanthin (Fx) and the main photoprotective pigment pool comprised of diadinoxanthin (Ddx) and its reversibly de-epoxidized form diatoxanthin (Dtx). We used sequence comparison to known carotenoid biosynthesis enzymes to identify novel candidates in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. Microarray and RNA-seq data was used to select candidates with transcriptomic responses similar to known carotenoid biosynthesis genes and to create full-length gene models, and we focused on those that encode proteins predicted to be chloroplast-localized. We identified a violaxanthin de-epoxidase-like gene (Thaps3_11707, VDL2) that when overexpressed results in increased Fx abundance while stoichiometrically reducing Ddx+Dtx. Based on transcriptomics, we hypothesize that Thaps3_10233 may also contribute to Fx biosynthesis, in addition to VDL2. Separately using antisense RNA to target VDL2, VDL1, and both LUT1-like copies (hypothesized to catalyze an earlier step in the pathway) simultaneously, reduced the overall cellular photosynthetic pigment content, including chlorophylls, suggesting destabilization of light-harvesting complexes by Fx deficiency. Based on transcriptomic and physiological data, we hypothesize that the two predicted T. pseudonana zeaxanthin epoxidases have distinct functions and that different copies of phytoene synthase and phytoene desaturase may serve to initiate carotenoid biosynthesis in response to different cellular needs.

However, the mechanism regulating centrosome positioning is still unclear and often confused with the mechanism regulating the position of the nucleus to which it is linked. Here we used enucleated cells plated on adhesive micropatterns to impose regular and precise geometrical conditions to centrosome-microtubule networks. Although frequently observed there, the equilibrium position of the centrosome is not systematically at the cell geometrical center and can be close to cell edge. Centrosome positioning appears to respond accurately to the architecture and anisotropy of the actin network, which constitutes, rather than cell shape, the actual spatial boundary conditions the microtubule network is sensitive to. We found that the contraction of the actin network defines a peripheral margin, in which microtubules appeared bent by compressive forces. The disassembly of the actin network away from the cell edges defines an inner zone where actin bundles were absent and microtubules were more radially organized. The production of dynein-based forces on microtubules places the centrosome at the center of this inner zone. Cell adhesion pattern and contractile forces define the shape and position of the inner zone in which the centrosome-microtubule network is centered.","NA"

Because the vast majority of RNA in bacteria is ribosomal RNA (rRNA), it is standard practice to deplete the rRNA from a total RNA sample such that the reads in an RNA-seq experiment derive predominantly from mRNA. One of the most commonly used commercial kits for rRNA depletion, the Ribo-Zero kit from Illumina, was recently discontinued. Here, we report the development a simple, cost-effective, and robust method for depleting rRNA that can be easily implemented by any lab or facility. We first developed an algorithm for designing biotinylated oligonucleotides that will hybridize tightly and specifically to the 23S, 16S, and 5S rRNAs from any species of interest. Precipitation of these oligonucleotides bound to rRNA by magnetic streptavidin beads then depletes rRNA from a complex, total RNA sample such that ~75-80% of reads in a typical RNA-seq experiment derive from mRNA. Importantly, we demonstrate a high correlation of RNA abundance or fold-change measurements in RNA-seq experiments between our method and the previously available Ribo-Zero kit. Complete details on the methodology are provided, including open-source software for designing oligonucleotides optimized for any bacterial species or metagenomic sample of interest.

ImportanceThe ability to examine global patterns of gene expression in microbes through RNA-sequencing has fundamentally transformed microbiology. However, RNA-seq depends critically on the removal of ribosomal RNA from total RNA samples. Otherwise, rRNA would comprise upwards of 90% of the reads in a typical RNA-seq experiment, limiting the reads coming from messenger RNA or requiring high total read depth. A commonly used, kit for rRNA subtraction from Illumina was recently discontinued. Here, we report the development of a  do-it-yourself kit for rapid, cost-effective, and robust depletion of rRNA from total RNA. We present an algorithm for designing biotinylated oligonucleotides that will hybridize to the rRNAs from a target set of species. We then demonstrate that the designed oligos enable sufficient rRNA depletion to produce RNA-seq data with 75-80% of reads comming from mRNA.

Development of antibiofilm agents that target these populations could therefore improve treatment success. HT61 is a quinoline derivative that has demonstrated efficacy towards non-dividing planktonic Staphylococcus spp. and therefore, in principal, could be effective against staphylococcal biofilms. In this study HT61 was tested on mature S. aureus biofilms, assessing both antimicrobial efficacy and characterising the cellular response to treatment. HT61 was found to be more effective than vancomycin in killing S. aureus biofilms (minimum bactericidal concentrations: HT61; 32 mg/L, vancomycin; 64 mg/L), and in reducing biofilm biomass. Scanning electron microscopy of HT61-treated biofilms also revealed disrupted cellular structure and biofilm architecture. HT61 treatment resulted in increased expression of proteins associated with the cell wall stress stimulon and dcw cluster, implying global changes in peptidoglycan and cell wall biosynthesis. Altered expression of metabolic and translational proteins following treatment also confirm a general adaptive response.

To trace phylogenetic relationships, we constructed phylogenetic trees based on multi-locus sequence typing, and Genome-to-Genome Distance Comparisons. Chicken isolate 908 clustered with two of the cattle isolates along with three isolates from chickens in Denmark and an isolate of S. agnetis we isolated from a BCO lesion on a commercial broiler farm in Arkansas. We used a number of BLAST tools to compare the chicken isolates to those from cattle and identified 98 coding sequences distinguishing isolate 908 from the cattle isolates.

ImportanceStaphylococcus agnetis has been recently recognized as associated with disease in dairy cattle and meat type chickens. The infections appear to be limited in cattle and systemic in broilers. This report details the molecular relationships between cattle and chicken isolates in order to understand how this recently recognized species infects different hosts with different disease manifestations. The data show the chicken and cattle isolates are very closely related but the chicken isolates all cluster together suggesting a single jump from cattle to chickens.","10.1128/AEM.00484-20"

This technique has been developed for in vivo applications and recordings from discrete brain nuclei in experimental animals. The small size of the carbon fiber electrode (7m, length <100m) ensures minimal disruption of the brain tissue and allows recordings from small brain areas. Sample rate (up to 4 Hz) is sufficient to resolve rapid changes in PtO2 and pH that follow changes in neuronal activity and metabolism. Rapid switching between current and voltage recordings allows combined electrochemical detection and monitoring of extracellular action potentials. For simultaneous electrochemical detection of PtO2 and pH, two consecutive trapezoidal voltage ramps are applied with double differential-subtraction of the background current. This enables changes in current caused by protons and oxygen to be detected separately with minimal interference between the two. The profile of PtO2 changes evoked by increases in local neuronal activity recorded using the described technique was similar to that of blood oxygen level dependent responses recorded using fMRI. This voltammetric technique can be combined with fMRI and brain vessel imaging to study the metabolic mechanisms underlying neurovascular coupling response with much greater spatial and temporal resolution than is currently possible.","10.1016/j.biosx.2020.100034"

As a result, decoding analyses are now used across a wide range of model organisms and experimental paradigms. However, typical analyses employ general purpose decoding algorithms that do not explicitly take advantage of the structure of neural variability, which is often low-dimensional and can thus be effectively characterized using latent variables. Here we propose a new decoding framework that exploits the low-dimensional structure of neural population variability by removing correlated variability that is unrelated to the decoded variable, then decoding the resulting denoised activity. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework using simulated data, where the true upper bounds for decoding performance are known. A linear version of our decoder provides an estimator for the decoded variable that can be more efficient than other commonly used linear estimators such as linear discriminant analysis. In addition, our proposed decoding framework admits a simple extension to nonlinear decoding that compares favorably to standard feed-forward neural networks. By explicitly modeling shared population variability, the success of the resulting linear and nonlinear decoders also offers a new perspective on the relationship between shared variability and information contained in large neural populations.","NA"

Improved genetics for drought tolerance would enable the identification and development of resilient varieties, resulting in increased canola production. The main objective of this study was to dissect the genetic basis of seed yield under water-limited conditions in canola. A doubled haploid population derived from a cross between two Australian parental lines, RP04 and Ag-Outback, was evaluated to identify the genetic variation in fractional normalised deviation vegetative index (NDVI), above ground shoot biomass accumulation, flowering time, and plasticity in seed yield under irrigated and rainfed field conditions in two consecutive years. An irrigation treatment was applied at the 50% flowering stage and an incremental drought tolerance index (DTI) was estimated for seed yield. By utilising a genetic linkage map based on 18,851 genome-wide DArTseq markers, we identified 25 genomic regions significantly associated with different traits (LOD [&ge;] 3), accounting for 5.5 to 22.3% of the genotypic variance. Three significant genomic regions on chromosome A06, A10 and C04 were associated with DTI for seed yield. Some of the QTL were localised in the close proximity of candidates genes involved in traits contributing to drought escape and drought avoidance mechanisms, including FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC).

GmSALT3 confers net shoot exclusion for both Na+ and Cl- to soybean and improved salt tolerance; however, how the ER-localised GmSALT3 achieves this is unknown. Here, GmSALT3 function was investigated in heterologous systems, and in near isogenic lines that contained the full-length GmSALT3 gene (NIL-T; salt-tolerant) or a truncated transcript (NIL-S; salt-sensitive). A time course analysis of the NILs confirmed shoot Cl- exclusion breaks down days prior to Na+ exclusion. Shoot Na+ exclusion occurs via a root xylem-based mechanism in NIL-T lines, as is common amongst plants, with Na+ content significantly greater in NIL-S stem xylem sap. In contrast, NIL-T plants exhibited significantly greater Cl- content in both the stem xylem and phloem sap compared to NIL-S, indicating that shoot Cl- exclusion likely depends upon a novel phloem-based Cl- recirculation back to NIL-T roots. In heterologous expression systems, GmSALT3 restored growth of K+-uptake-defective E. coli, whilst in Xenopus laevis oocytes, GmSALT3 contributed to net influx and accumulation of Na+, K+, and Cl-. Overall, these findings provide new insights on the impact of ER-localised GmSALT3 on plasma membrane ion fluxes and reveals a novel mechanism for shoot Cl- exclusion.

HighlightGmSALT3 is a candidate gene that impacts soybean salt tolerance.

Particularly, heat stress induces misfolding and aggregation of proteins which are guarded by chaperone systems. Here, we examine the function the glutaredoxin GRXS17, a member of thiol reductases families in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. GRXS17 is a nucleocytosolic monothiol glutaredoxin consisting of an N-terminal thioredoxin (TRX)-domain and three CGFS-active site motif-containing GRX-domains that coordinate three iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in a glutathione (GSH)-dependent manner. As a Fe-S cluster-charged holoenzyme, GRXS17 is likely involved in the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins. In addition to its role in cluster biogenesis, we showed that GRXS17 presents both foldase and redox-dependent holdase activities. Oxidative stress in combination with heat stress induces loss of its Fe-S clusters followed by subsequent formation of disulfide bonds between conserved active site cysteines in the corresponding TRX domains. This oxidation leads to a shift of GRXS17 to a high-MW complex and thus, activates its holdase activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that GRXS17 is specifically involved in plant tolerance to moderate high temperature and protects root meristematic cells from heat-induced cell death. Finally, we showed that upon heat stress, GRXS17 changes its client proteins, possibly to protect them from heat injuries. Therefore, we propose that the iron-sulfur cluster enzyme glutaredoxin GRXS17 is an essential guard to protect proteins against moderate heat stress, likely through a redox-dependent chaperone activity. All in all, we reveal the mechanism of an Fe-S cluster-dependent activity shift, turning the holoenzyme GRXS17 into a holdase that prevents damage caused by heat stress.","NA"

We find that the cells in 3D collagen matrices remain round or adopt an elongated shape depending on the density of active integrins, the level of contractility regulated by mechanosensitive signaling pathways and the density and mechanics of the matrix. While the formation of actin fibers that run along the cell body mediated by integrins and matrix stiffness drive elongation of cells, the cortical and membrane tension resist elongation. Based on the competition between these mechanisms, we derive phase diagrams for cell shape in the space spanned by the density of active adhesions and the level of biochemical signaling that controls contractility.

Several studies have shown that the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 promotes starvation-induced autophagy. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report that in amino acid deprived cells, p27 controls autophagy via an mTORC1-dependent mechanism. During prolonged amino acid starvation, a fraction of p27 is recruited to lysosomes where it interacts with LAMTOR1, a component of the Ragulator complex required for mTORC1 lysosomal localization and activation. p27 binding to LAMTOR1 prevents Ragulator assembly and function and subsequent mTORC1 activation, thereby promoting autophagy. Conversely, upon amino acid withdrawal, p27-/- cells exhibit elevated mTORC1 signaling, impaired lysosomal activity and autophagy, and resistance to apoptosis. This is associated with sequestration of TFEB in the cytoplasm, preventing the induction of lysosomal genes required for lysosomal function. Silencing of LAMTOR1 or mTOR inhibition restores autophagy and induces apoptosis in p27-/- cells. Together, these results reveal a direct, coordinated regulation between the cell cycle and cell growth machineries.","NA"

Global genetic deletion of the neuropeptide, Vip or its receptor Vipr2, results in profound deficits in daily synchrony among SCN cells and daily rhythms in locomotor behavior and glucocorticoid secretion. To test whether this phenotype depends on VIP neurons in the SCN, we ablated VIP SCN neurons in vivo in adult mice through Caspase3-mediated induction of the apoptotic pathway in cre-expressing VIP neurons. We found that ablation of VIP SCN neurons in adult mice caused a phenotype distinct from Vip- and Vipr2- null mice. Mice lacking VIP neurons retained rhythmic locomotor activity with a shortened circadian period, more variable onsets and decreased duration of daily activity. Circadian hormonal outputs, specifically corticosterone rhythms were severely dampened. In contrast, deletion of neonatal SCN VIP neurons dramatically reduced circadian gene expression in the cultured SCN, mimicking the effects of global deletion of Vip or Vipr2. These results suggest that SCN VIP neurons play a role in lengthening circadian period and stimulating the daily surge in glucocorticoids in adults and in synchronizing and sustaining daily rhythms among cells in the developing SCN.

Significance StatementThe importance of the neuropeptide, VIP, for circadian rhythms has been described in mice lacking the gene for Vip or its receptor, Vipr2. This study found that ablation of VIP neurons only in the adult SCN reproduced the loss of circadian rhythms in glucocorticoids, but not the loss of circadian locomotor behavior, seen with global loss of VIP signaling. We conclude that VIP SCN neurons play two roles: one in adulthood lengthening circadian period and regulating circadian outputs, and one in development coordinating synchrony among circadian cells.","NA"

Here, we report that stably expressed sequences in C. elegans have features that provide a barrier against TEI. By using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting the same sequence in different genes, we show that genes typically recover from silencing within the germline in a few generations. A rare recombinant two-gene operon containing this target sequence that recovered poorly from induced silencing enabled us to delineate mechanisms that can perpetuate silencing. Parental exposure to dsRNA targeting one gene within this operon reveals two distinct phases of the resulting TEI: only the matching gene is silenced in early generations, but both can become silenced in later generations. However, silencing of both genes can be initiated within one generation by mating, which perturbs intergenerational RNA-based mechanisms such that silencing dominates for more than 250 generations. This stable RNA silencing can also reduce the expression of homologous sequences in different genes in trans within the germline, but the homologous genes recover expression after a few generations. These results suggest that stably expressed sequences are subject to feedback control that opposes TEI initiated by multiple mechanisms within the germline. We speculate that similar homeostatic mechanisms that enable recovery from epigenetic changes underlie the observed preservation of form and function in successive generations of living systems.","NA"

However, the relationships with root traits, and the associated belowground plant functioning such as N uptake, including nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+), is still poorly known. Additionally, environmental variations occurring both in time and in space could uncouple LES from root traits. We explored, in subalpine grasslands, the relationships between leaf and root morphological traits for 3 dominant perennial grass species, and to what extent they contribute to the whole-plant economics spectrum. We also investigated the link between this spectrum and NO3- and NH4+ uptake rates, as well as the variations of uptake across four grasslands differing by the land-use history at peak biomass and in autumn. Although poorly correlated with leaf traits, root traits contributed to an economic spectrum at the whole plant level. Higher NH4+ and NO3- uptake abilities were associated with the resource-acquisitive strategy.

Nonetheless, NH4+ and NO3- uptake within species varied between land-uses and with sampling time, suggesting that LES and plant traits are good, but still incomplete, descriptors of plant functioning. Although the NH4+: NO3- uptake ratio was different between plant species in our study, they all showed a preference for NH4+, and particularly the most conservative species. Soil environmental variations between grasslands and sampling times may also drive to some extent the NH4+ and NO3- uptake ability of species.

Here we investigated the nuclease resistance and biostability of the multi-stranded motif called paranemic crossover (PX) DNA and discovered a remarkable and previously unreported resistance to nucleases. We show that PX DNA has more than an order of magnitude increased resistance to degradation by DNase I, serum, and urine compared to double stranded DNA. We further demonstrate that the degradation resistance decreases monotonically as DNA crossovers are removed from the structure, suggesting that frequent DNA crossovers disrupt either the binding or catalysis of nucleases or both.

These results have important implications for building DNA nanostructures with enhanced biostability, either by adopting PX-based architectures or by carefully engineering crossovers.

Regions of the brain differ in their temporal scale (i.e., a cortical temporal hierarchy) and those receptive to long temporal windows may facilitate social-cognitive abilities; however, the cortical development of long timescale processing remains to be investigated. The current study utilized naturalistic viewing to examine cortical development of long timescale processing and its relation to social-cognitive abilities in middle childhood - a time of expanding social spheres and increasing social-cognitive abilities. We found that, compared to adults, children exhibited reduced low-frequency power in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and reduced specialization for long timescale processing within the TPJ and other regions broadly implicated in the default mode network and higher-order visual processing. Further, specialization for long timescales within the right dorsal medial prefrontal cortex became more  adult-like as a function of childrens comprehension of character mental states. These results suggest that cortical temporal hierarchy in middle childhood is immature and may be important for an accurate representation of complex naturalistic social stimuli during this age.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116616"

This study focuses on the involvement of SlARF4 in tomato tolerance to salinity and osmotic stress. Using a reverse genetic approach, we found that the antisense down-regulation of SlARF4 promotes root development and density, increases soluble sugars content and maintains chlorophyll content at high levels under stress conditions. Furthermore, ARF4-as displayed higher tolerance to salt and osmotic stress through reduced stomatal conductance coupled with increased leaf relative water content and ABA content under normal and stressful conditions. This increase in ABA content was correlated with the activation of ABA biosynthesis genes and the repression of ABA catabolism genes. cat1, Cu/ZnSOD and mdhar genes were up-regulated in ARF4-as plants which can result in a better tolerance to salt and osmotic stress. A CRISPR/Cas9 induced SlARF4 mutant showed similar growth and stomatal responses as ARF4-as plants, which suggest that arf4-cr can tolerate salt and osmotic stresses. Our data support the involvement of ARF4 as a key factor in tomato tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses and confirm the use of CRISPR technology as an efficient tool for functional reverse genetics studies.","NA"

(2) How can additional functionality, such as proofreading/error-correction, be built into machine function using standard biochemical processes? Answers to these questions will aid both the understanding of molecular-scale cell biology and the design of synthetic machines. Focusing on transport in this initial study, we sample a variety of mechanisms by employing Metropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo. Trial moves adjust transition rates among an automatically generated set of conformational and binding states while maintaining fidelity to thermodynamic principles and a user-supplied fitness/functionality goal. Each accepted move generates a new model. The simulations yield both single and mixed reaction pathways for cotransport in a simple environment with a single substrate along with a driving ion. In a ""competitive"" environment including an additional decoy substrate, several qualitatively distinct reaction pathways are found which are capable of extremely high discrimination coupled to a leak of the driving ion, akin to proofreading. The array of functional models would be difficult to find by intuition alone in the complex state-spaces of interest.

Author summaryMolecular machines, which operate on the nanoscale, are proteins/complexes that perform remarkable tasks such as the selective absorption of nutrients into the cell by transporters. These complex machines are often described using a fairly simple set of states and transitions that may not account for the stochasticity and heterogeneity generally expected at the nanoscale at body temperature. New tools are needed to study the full array of possibilities. This study presents a novel in silico method to systematically generate testable molecular-machine kinetic models and explore alternative mechanisms, applied first to membrane transport proteins. Our initial results suggest these transport machines may contain mechanisms which  detoxify the cell of an unwanted toxin, as well as significantly discriminate against the import of the toxin. This novel approach should aid the experimental study of key physiological processes such as renal glucose re-absorption, rational drug design, and potentially the development of synthetic machines.","NA"

We examined network reactivity and connectivity in participants who played an economic trust game with close friends, strangers and a computer. Network reactivity analyses showed enhanced activation of the DMN to social relative to non-social outcomes. A novel network psychophysiological interaction analysis (nPPI) revealed enhanced connectivity between the DMN and the superior frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule when experiencing reciprocated vs. violated trust from friends relative to strangers. Such connectivity tracked with differences in self-reported social closeness with these partners. Interestingly, reactivity of the executive control network (ECN), involved in decision processes, demonstrated no social vs. non-social preference, and ECN-ventral striatum (VS) connectivity did not track social closeness.

Here, we investigated the morphogenesis of extraocular muscles (EOMs), an evolutionary conserved cranial muscle group that is crucial for the coordinated movement of the eyeballs and for visual acuity. By means of lineage analysis, we redefined the cellular origins of periocular connective tissues interacting with the EOMs, which do not arise exclusively from neural crest mesenchyme as previously thought. Using 3D imaging approaches, we established an integrative blueprint for the EOM functional unit. By doing so, we identified a developmental time window where individual EOMs emerge from a unique muscle anlage and establish insertions in the sclera, which sets these muscles apart from classical muscle-to-bone type of insertions. Further, we demonstrate that the eyeballs are a source of diffusible retinoic acid that allow their targeting by the EOMs in a temporal and dose dependent manner. Using genetically modified mice and inhibitor treatments, we find that endogenous local variations in the concentration of retinoids contribute to the establishment of tendon condensations and attachment sites that precede the initiation of muscle patterning. Collectively, our results highlight how global and site-specific programs are deployed for the assembly of muscle functional units with precise definition of muscle shapes and topographical wiring of their tendon attachments.","NA"

The composition of the microbiome (the assemblage of symbiotic microorganisms within a host) is determined by environmental factors and the hosts immune, endocrine and neural systems. The social environment could alter host microbiomes extrinsically by affecting transmission between individuals, likely promoting homogeneity in the microbiome of social partners. Alternatively, intrinsic effects arising from interactions between the microbiome and host physiology (the microbiota-gut-brain axis) could translate social stress into dysbiotic microbiomes, with consequences for host health. We investigated how manipulating social environments during larval and adult life-stages altered the microbiome composition of Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies. We used social contexts that particularly alter the development and lifespan of males, predicting that any intrinsic social effects on the microbiome would therefore be sex-specific. The presence of adult males during the larval stage significantly altered the microbiome of pupae of both sexes. In adults, same-sex grouping increased bacterial diversity in both sexes. Importantly, the microbiome community structure of males was more sensitive to social contact at older ages, an effect partially mitigated by housing focal males with young rather than co-aged groups. Functional analyses suggest that these microbiome changes impact ageing and immune responses. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the substantial effects of the social environment on individual health are mediated through intrinsic effects on the microbiome, and provides a model for understanding the mechanistic basis of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

Significance statementThe social environment has pervasive, multifaceted effects on individual health and fitness. If a hosts microbiome is sensitive to the social environment then it could be an important mediator of social effects, as the reciprocal relationships between hosts and their microbiomes have substantial implications for host health. Using a Drosophila melanogaster fruit fly model we show that the fly microbiome is sensitive to the social environment in a sex, age and life-stage dependent manner. In particular, older adult male microbiome communities are altered by same-sex social contact, but this depends on the age of the social partners. These changes have functional effects on fly immunity and lifespan, evidence that indeed this is an influential mediator of social effects on health.","NA"

Here we sought to demonstrate, for the first time, that ethanol induces conditioned place preference or aversion (CPP or CPA) when administered locally into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the associated role of MORs. We further analyzed the changes in the expression and mRNA levels of GluN1 and GluN2A subunits in designated brain areas.

We have previously demonstrated that hypercoagulopathy is proportional to NS severity in rat models and that pioglitazone (Pio) reduces proteinuria both independently and in combination with methylprednisolone (MP), a glucocorticoid (GC). However, the effect of these treatments on NS-associated hypercoagulopathy remains unknown. We thus sought to determine the ability of Pio and GC to alleviate NS-associated hypercoagulopathy.

MethodsPuromycin aminonucleoside-induced rat NS was treated with sham, Low- or High-dose MP, Pio, or combination (Pio+Low-MP) and plasma was collected at day 11. Plasma samples were collected from children with steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) and steroid-resistant NS (SRNS) upon presentation and after 7 weeks of GC therapy. Plasma endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), antithrombin (AT) activity, and albumin (Alb) were measured using thrombin generation, amidolytic, and colorimetric assays, respectively.

ResultsIn a rat model of NS, both High-MP and Pio improved proteinuria and corrected hypoalbuminemia, ETP and AT activity (P<0.05). Proteinuria (P=0.005) and hypoalbuminemia (P<0.001) were correlated with ETP. In childhood NS, while ETP was not different at presentation, GC therapy improved proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and ETP in children with SSNS (P<0.001) but not SRNS (P=0.330).

ConclusionsBoth Pio and GC diminish proteinuria and significantly alleviate hypercoagulopathy. Both Pio and MP improved hypercoagulopathy in rats, and successful GC therapy (SSNS) also improved hypercoagulopathy in childhood NS. These data suggest that even a partial reduction in proteinuria may reduce NS-associated thrombotic risk.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by massive proteinuria and is complicated by a complex, acquired hypercoagulopathy that markedly increases the risk for potentially life-threatening venous thromboembolism (VTE). This study demonstrates a strong correlation between proteinuria reduction and improvement of an established VTE-risk biomarker, in both a well-established animal model and in childhood NS before and after steroid treatment. We show that nuclear receptor agonists with known disparate mechanisms of action successfully reduce proteinuria and simultaneously improve NS-associated hypercoagulopathy. These data suggest that complete or partial proteinuria reduction by any therapeutic modality may concurrently reduce NS-associated thrombotic risk.","NA"

How this one-on-one relation is established is still unknown, but anatomical evidence suggests that during development principal neurons are innervated by multiple calyces, which may indicate calyceal competition. However, in vivo electrophysiological recordings from principal neurons indicated that only a single strong synaptic connection forms per cell. To test whether a mismatch exists between synaptic strength and terminal size, we compared the strength of synaptic inputs with the morphology of the synaptic terminals. In vivo whole-cell recordings of the MNTB neurons from newborn Wistar rats of either sex were made while stimulating their afferent axons, allowing us to identify multiple inputs. The strength of the strongest input increased to calyceal levels in a few days across cells, while the strength of the second strongest input was stable. The recorded cells were subsequently immunolabeled for vesicular glutamate transporters (VGluT) to reveal axosomatic terminals with structured-illumination microscopy. Synaptic strength of the strongest input was correlated with the contact area of the largest VGluT cluster at the soma (r = 0.8), and no indication of a mismatch between structure and strength was observed. Together, our data agree with a developmental scheme in which one input strengthens and becomes the calyx of Held, but not with multi-calyceal competition.

Here, we use a novel data-driven approach with high temporal precision to find recurring brain networks from fMRI data and estimate when these networks become active during exposure to either trauma reminders or neutral pictures. We found that PTSD patients spend less time in two default mode sub-networks in contrast to trauma-exposed healthy controls, and that PTSD symptom severity correlates positively with time spent in the salience network during exposure to trauma reminders. The former are important for different aspects of self-referential processing and the latter for detection of threat.

Decreased resources during childhood has been associated with increased risk for developing stress-related disorders, including major depressive disorder and anxiety Although the link between early life adversity and increased risk for psychopathology has been well established, the developmental mechanisms remain unclear. Using a mouse model of poverty-like rearing, limited bedding and nesting materials (LB), we tested the effects of LB on the development of fear learning and of key neuronal structures involved in emotional regulation, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). LB delayed the ability of pre-adolescent mice to express, but not form, an auditory conditioned fear memory. LB disrupted typical fear circuit development, accelerating parvalbumin positive (PV+) inhibitory interneuron maturation in the BLA and delaying the maturation of connections between the mPFC and BLA. The decreased fear expression in LB reared mice during early development was rescued through optogenetic inactivation of PV+ cells in the BLA. Together our data demonstrate that LB has profound and deleterious effects on mPFC and BLA development, decreasing threat-associated behavior expression, but not learning, in childhood. The current results provide a model of transiently blunt emotional reactivity in childhood, with fear-associated memories emerging later in adolescence, and possibly contributing to later pathology development.","NA"

However, damage preserved as paleopathologies on bone can record how an animal moved in life, potentially reflecting patterns of behavior. Here, for the first time, we use computed tomography (CT) to assess hypothesized etiologies of pathology in a pelvis and associated right femur of an adult Smilodon fatalis saber-toothed cat, one of the best-studied mammal species from the Pleistocene-age Rancho La Brea asphalt seeps, Los Angeles, California. The pelvis exhibits massive destruction of the right acetabulum that previously was interpreted, for nearly a century, to have resulted from trauma and infection. We evaluated this historical interpretation using CT imaging to supplement gross morphology in identifying symptoms of traumatic, infective, or degenerative arthritis. We found that the pathologic distortions are inconsistent with degenerative changes that started only later in life, as in the case of infective or traumatic arthritis. Rather, they characterize chronic remodeling that began at birth and led to degeneration of the joint over time. These findings suggest that this individual suffered from hip dysplasia, a congenital condition common in domestic dogs and cats.

The individual examined in this study reached adulthood (at least four to seven years of age) but never could have hunted properly nor defended territory on its own. As such, this individual, and other critically pathologic Smilodon like it, likely survived to adulthood by association with a social group that assisted it with feeding and protection. The pathologic specimens examined here in detail are consistent with a spectrum of social strategies in Smilodon supported by a predominance of previous studies. This application of a relatively new and interdisciplinary technique to an old question therefore informs the longstanding debate between social and solitary hypotheses for the behavior of an extinct predator.","NA"

We have published that the deregulated DNA-PKcs kinase cascade ensures rapid degradation of topoI and is at the core of the drug resistance mechanism of topoI inhibitors, including irinotecan. We also identified CTD small phosphatase 1 (CTDSP1) (a nuclear phosphatase) as a primary upstream regulator of DNA-PKcs in response to topoI inhibitors.

The purpose of this study was to confirm the effects of rabeprazole on CTDSP1 activity and its impact on colon cancer. Using HCT116 and HT29, with high and low CTDSP1 expression respectively and a retrospective analysis of patients receiving irinotecan with or without rabeprazole have indicated the effect of CTDSP1 in irinotecan response. These results indicate that CTDSP1 promotes sensitivity to irinotecan and rabeprazole prevents this effect, resulting in drug resistance. To ensure the best chance at effective treatment, rabeprazole may not be a suitable PPI for cancer patients treated with irinotecan.","NA"

Instead, we demonstrate that longevity-promoting DAF-16/FOXO and heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF-1) increase immunocompetence in old daf-2(-) animals. The upregulation of DAF-16/FOXO and HSF-1 decreases the expression of the zip-10/bZIP transcription factor, which in turn downregulates INS-7, an agonistic insulin-like peptide, resulting in further reduction of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS). Thus, reduced IIS bypasses immunosenescence and rejuvenates immunity via the upregulation of anti-aging transcription factors that modulate an endocrine insulin-like peptide through a positive feedback mechanism. Because many functions of IIS are conserved across phyla, our study may lead to the development of strategies for human immune rejuvenation.","NA"

The more essential to the emergence of the dynamical behavior of cancer growth these are, the more effectively they may be used as mechanisms for interventions. Mathematical modeling can help unearth such connections, and help explain how they shape the dynamics of cancer growth. Here, we explored whether there exist simple, consistent properties of cancer-immune system interaction (CISI) models that might be harnessed to devise effective immunotherapy approaches. We did this for a family of three related models of increasing complexity. To this end, we developed a base model of CISI, which captures some essential features of the more complex models built on it. We find that the base model and its derivates can plausibly reproduce biological behavior that is consistent with the notion of an immunological barrier. This behavior is also in accord with situations in which the suppressive effects exerted by cancer cells on immune cells dominate their proliferative effects. Under these circumstances, the model family may display a pattern of bistability, where two distinct, stable states (a cancer-free, and a full-grown cancer state) are possible. Increasing the effectiveness of immune-caused cancer cell killing may remove the basis for bistability, and abruptly tip the dynamics of the system into a cancer-free state. Additionally, in combination with the administration of immune effector cells, modifications in cancer cell killing may be harnessed for immunotherapy without the need for resolving the bistability. We use these ideas to test immunotherapeutic interventions in silico in a stochastic version of the base model. This bistability-reliant approach to cancer interventions might offer advantages over those that comprise gradual declines in cancer cell numbers.","10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110185"

Damage primarily to inferior frontal cortex affected the production of syntactically accurate structure.

To monitor the temporal dynamics of processing, we recorded multiple-unit firings of CA1 neurons in male rats experiencing one of four episodes for 10 min: restraint stress, social interaction with a female or male, or observation of a novel object. Before an experience, the neurons mostly exhibited sporadic firings with some synchronized ({approx} 50 ms) ripple-like firing events in habituated home cage. After experience onset, restraint or social interaction with other rats induced spontaneous high-frequency firings (super bursts) intermittently, while object observation induced the events inconsistently. Minutes after experience initiation, CA1 neurons frequently exhibited ripple-like firings with less-firing silent periods. The number of ripple-like events depended on the episode experienced and correlated with the total duration of super bursts. Experience clearly diversified multiple features of individual ripple-like events in an episode-specific manner, sustained for more than 30 min in the home cage.

Ex vivo patch clamp analysis further revealed experience-promoted synaptic plasticity. Compared with unexposed controls, animals experiencing the female, male, or restraint episodes showed cell-dependently increased AMPA- or GABAA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents, whereas contact with a novel object increased only GABAergic currents. Multivariate ANOVA in multi-dimensional virtual space revealed experience-specific super bursts with subsequent ripple-like events and synaptic plasticity, leading us to hypothesize that these factors are responsible for creating experience-specific memory. It is possible to decipher encrypted experience through the deep learning of the orchestrated ripple-like firings and synaptic plasticity in multiple CA1 neurons.","NA"

We find that glutaminase isoform Gls2, expressed in normal liver, compensates for the deletion of Gls1 isoform expressed in tumours. Inhibiting both glutaminases significantly delays tumourigenesis but does not completely block glutamine catabolism through the Krebs cycle. We reveal that glutamine catabolism is then driven by amidotransferases. Consistently, the synergistic effect of glutaminase and amidotransferase inhibitors on proliferation of mouse and human tumour cells is observed in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, when Gls1 is deleted the Krebs cycle activity and tumour formation can also be significantly affected if glycolysis is co-inhibited (Gls1KO/Hk2KO). Finally, the inhibition of either serine (Psat1KO) or fatty acid (FasnKO) biosynthesis can be compensated by uptake of circulating nutrients. Thus, removing these nutrients from the diet produces synergistic effects on suppression of tumourigenesis.

Bat white-nose syndrome (WNS) is a rapidly spreading wildlife disease in North America. The fungus causing the disease invades skin tissues of hibernating bats, resulting in disruption of hibernation behavior, premature energy depletion, and subsequent death. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate changes in allele frequencies within a population of Myotis lucifugus in eastern North America to search for genetic resistance to WNS. Our results show low FST values within the population across time, i.e. prior to WNS (Pre-WNS) compared to the population that has survived WNS (Post-WNS). However, when dividing the population with a geographical cut-off between the states of Pennsylvania and New York, a sharp increase in values on scaffold GL429776 is evident in the Post-WNS samples. Genes present in the diverged area are associated with thermoregulation and promotion of brown fat production. Thus, although WNS may not have subjected the entire M. lucifugus population to selective pressure, it may have selected for specific alleles in Pennsylvania through decreased gene flow within the population. However, the persistence of remnant sub-populations in the aftermath of WNS is likely due to multiple factors in bat life history.","10.1534/g3.119.400966"

The recently described latent causal variable (LCV) approach provides an alternative method for causal inference which might be useful in hypothesis-free experiments.

MethodsWe developed an automated pipeline for phenome-wide tests using the LCV approach including steps to estimate partial genetic causality, filter to a meaningful set of estimates, apply correction for multiple testing and then present the findings in a graphical summary termed a causal architecture plot. We apply this process to body mass index and lipid traits as exemplars of traits where there is strong prior expectation for causal effects and dental caries and periodontitis as exemplars of traits where there is a need for causal inference.

ResultsThe results for lipids and BMI suggest that these traits are best viewed as creating consequences on a multitude of traits and conditions, thus providing additional evidence that supports viewing these traits as targets for interventions to improve health. On the other hand, caries and periodontitis are best viewed as a downstream consequence of other traits and diseases rather than a cause of ill health.

ConclusionsThe automated process is available as part of the MASSIVE pipeline from the Complex-Traits Genetics Virtual Lab (https://vl.genoma.io) and results are available in (https://view.genoma.io). We propose causal architecture plots based on phenome-wide partial genetic causality estimates as a way visualizing the overall causal map of the human phenome.

Key messagesO_LIThe latent causal variable approach uses summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to estimate a parameter termed genetic causality proportion.
C_LIO_LISystematic estimation of genetic causality proportion for many pairs of traits provides an alternative method for phenome-wide causal inference with some theoretical and practical advantages compared to phenome-wide Mendelian randomization.
C_LIO_LIUsing this approach, we confirm that lipid traits are an upstream risk factor for other traits and diseases, and we identify that dental diseases are predominantly a downstream consequence of other traits rather than a cause of poor systemic health.
C_LIO_LIThe method assumes no bidirectional causality and no confounding by environmental correlates of genotypes, so care is needed when these assumptions are not met.
C_LIO_LIWe developed an automated and accessible pipeline for estimating phenome-wide causal relationships and generating interactive visual summaries.

The human visual system incorporates several solutions to this challenge, one of which is a reflexive covert attention system that is rapidly responsive to both the physical salience and the task-relevance of new information. This paper presents a model that simulates behavioral and neural correlates of reflexive attention as the product of brief neural attractor states that are formed across the visual hierarchy when attention is engaged. Such attractors emerge from an attentional gradient distributed over a population of topographically organized neurons and serve to focus processing at one or more locations in the visual field, while inhibiting the processing of lower priority information. The model moves towards a resolution of key debates about the nature of reflexive attention, such as whether it is parallel or serial, and whether suppression effects are distributed in a spatial surround, or selectively at the location of distractors. Most importantly, the model develops a framework for understanding the neural mechanisms of visual attention as a spatiotopic decision process within a hierarchy and links them to observable correlates such as accuracy, reaction time, and the N2pc and PD components of the EEG. This last contribution is the most crucial for repairing the disconnect that exists between our understanding of behavioral and neural correlates of attention.","NA"

GmSALT3 confers net shoot exclusion for both Na+ and Cl- to soybean and improved salt tolerance; however, how the ER-localised GmSALT3 achieves this is unknown. Here, GmSALT3 function was investigated in heterologous systems, and in near isogenic lines that contained the full-length GmSALT3 gene (NIL-T; salt-tolerant) or a truncated transcript (NIL-S; salt-sensitive). A time course analysis of the NILs confirmed shoot Cl- exclusion breaks down days prior to Na+ exclusion. Shoot Na+ exclusion occurs via a root xylem-based mechanism in NIL-T lines, as is common amongst plants, with Na+ content significantly greater in NIL-S stem xylem sap. In contrast, NIL-T plants exhibited significantly greater Cl- content in both the stem xylem and phloem sap compared to NIL-S, indicating that shoot Cl- exclusion likely depends upon a novel phloem-based Cl- recirculation back to NIL-T roots. In heterologous expression systems, GmSALT3 restored growth of K+-uptake-defective E. coli, whilst in Xenopus laevis oocytes, GmSALT3 contributed to net influx and accumulation of Na+, K+, and Cl-. Overall, these findings provide new insights on the impact of ER-localised GmSALT3 on plasma membrane ion fluxes and reveals a novel mechanism for shoot Cl- exclusion.

HighlightGmSALT3 is a candidate gene that impacts soybean salt tolerance. Here, we found GmSALT3 can affect Na+, K+, and Cl- transport in heterologous systems, and is likely to contribute to soybean ionic toxicity tolerance through phloem-based Cl- recirculation from shoot and root xylem-based Na+ exclusion.","NA"

We identified thousands of loci that undergo extensive cell type-specific changes in accessibility during corticogenesis. Chromatin state profiling also reveals novel distinctions between neural progenitor cells from different cortical areas not seen in transcriptomic profiles and suggests a role for retinoic acid signaling in cortical arealization. Comparison of the cell type-specific chromatin landscape of cerebral organoids to primary developing cortex found that organoids establish broad cell type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns similar to the developing cortex, but lack many putative regulatory elements identified in homologous primary cell types.

While such reproductive proteins evolve in response to sexual selection pressures, how networks of interacting proteins arise and evolve as reproductive phenotypes change remains an open question. Here, we investigated the molecular evolution of the ""sex peptide network"" of Drosophila melanogaster, a functionally well-characterized reproductive protein network. In this species, the peptide hormone sex peptide (SP) and its interacting proteins cause major changes in female physiology and behavior after mating. In contrast, females of more distantly related Drosophila species do not respond to SP. In spite of these phenotypic differences, we detected orthologs of all network proteins across 22 diverse Drosophila species and found evidence that most orthologs likely function in reproduction throughout the genus. Within SP-responsive species, we detected the recurrent, adaptive evolution of several network proteins, consistent with sexual selection acting to continually refine network function. We also found some evidence for adaptive evolution of several proteins along two specific phylogenetic lineages that correspond with increased expression of the SP receptor in female reproductive tracts or increased sperm length, respectively. Finally, we used gene expression profiling to examine the likely degree of functional conservation of the paralogs of an SP network protein that arose via gene duplication. Our results suggest a dynamic history for the SP network in which network members arose before the onset of robust SP-mediated responses and then were shaped by both purifying and positive selection.","10.1111/jeb.13597"

Using a visual location discrimination task, we investigated what aspects of perceptual decisions lead to serial dependence, and disambiguated the influences of low-level sensory information, prior choices and motor actions on subsequent perceptual decisions. Following several biased (prior) location discriminations, subsequent (test) discriminations were biased toward the prior choices, even when reported via different motor actions, and when prior and test stimuli differed in color. By contrast, biased discriminations about an irrelevant stimulus feature did not substantially influence subsequent location discriminations. Additionally, biased stimulus locations, when color was discriminated, no longer substantially influenced subsequent location decisions. Hence, the degree of relevance between prior and subsequent perceptual decisions is a key factor for serial dependence. This suggests that serial-dependence reflects a high-level mechanism by which the brain predicts and interprets incoming sensory information in accordance with relevant prior choices.","NA"

However, their relative evolution over the entire adult lifespan in healthy individuals remains partly unknown during early and late adulthood, and particularly for the PSMD index. Here, we gathered and meta-analyzed cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 10 population-based cohort studies in order to establish the time course of white matter water diffusion phenotypes from post-adolescence to late adulthood. DTI data were obtained from a total of 20,005 individuals aged 18.1 to 92.6 years and analyzed with the same pipeline for computing DTI metrics. For each individual MD, AD, RD, and FA mean values were computed over their FA volume skeleton, PSMD being calculated as the 90% peak width of the MD values distribution across the FA skeleton. Mean values of each DTI metric were found to strongly vary across cohorts, most likely due to major differences in DWI acquisition protocols as well as pre-processing and DTI model fitting. However, age effects on each DTI metric were found to be highly consistent across cohorts. RD, MD and AD variations with age exhibited the same U-shape pattern, first slowly decreasing during post-adolescence until the age of 30, 40 and 50, respectively, then progressively increasing until late life. FA showed a reverse profile, initially increasing then continuously decreasing, slowly until the 70s, then sharply declining thereafter. By contrast, PSMD constantly increased, first slowly until the 60s, then more sharply. These results demonstrate that, in the general population, age affects PSMD in a manner different from that of other DTI metrics. The constant increase in PSMD throughout the entire adult life, including during post-adolescence, indicates that PSMD could be an early marker of the ageing process.","NA"

We show that this problem is equivalent to finding a smallest path cover in a compacted de Bruijn graph. Using this reduction, we prove a lower bound on the size of the optimal SPSS and propose a greedy method called UST that results in a smaller representation than unitigs and is nearly optimal with respect to our lower bound. We demonstrate the usefulness of the SPSS formulation with two applications of UST.

Artificially increasing dinucleotide frequencies results in substantial attenuation of virus replication, suggesting that these compositional changes may facilitate recognition of non-self RNA sequences. Recently, the interferon inducible protein ZAP, was identified as the host factor responsible for sensing CpG in viral RNA, through direct binding and possibly downstream targeting for degradation. Using an arrayed interferon stimulated gene expression library screen, we identified ZAPS, and its associated factor TRIM25, as direct inhibitors of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. Exogenous expression of ZAPS and TRIM25 significantly reduced virus replication while knockdown resulted in increased virus replication. HCMV displays a strikingly heterogeneous pattern of CpG representation with a specific suppression of CpGs within the IE1 major immediate early transcript which is absent in subsequently expressed genes. We demonstrated that suppression of CpG dinucleotides in the IE1 gene allows evasion of inhibitory effects of ZAP. During HCMV infection, expression of ZAP and TRIM25 are rapidly reduced, removing pressure to suppress dinucleotide frequencies in viral genes expressed after the immediate early genes, while acute virus replication and high levels of ZAP are mutually exclusive. Finally, we show that TRIM25 regulates alternative splicing between the ZAP short and long isoforms during HCMV infection and interferon induction, with knockdown of TRIM25 resulting in decreased ZAPS and corresponding increased ZAPL expression. These results demonstrate for the first time that ZAP is a potent host restriction factor against large DNA viruses and that HCMV evades ZAP detection through suppression of CpG dinucleotides within the major immediate early transcripts. Furthermore, TRIM25 is required for efficient upregulation of the interferon inducible short isoform of ZAP through regulation of alternative splicing.","NA"

Recognizing and delimiting species is particularly methodically challenging in fast-evolving, evolutionary young species complexes often characterized by low genetic divergence, hybrid origin, introgression and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Ranunculus auricomus is a large Eurasian apomictic polyploid complex that probably has arisen from the hybridization of a few sexual progenitor species. However, even delimitation and relationships of diploid sexual progenitors have been unclearly ranging from two to twelve species. Here, we present an innovative workflow combining phylogenomic methods based on 86,782 parameter-optimized RADseq loci and target enrichment of 663 nuclear genes together with geometric morphometrics to delimit sexual species in this evolutionary young complex (< 1 Mya). For the first time, we revealed a fully resolved and well-supported maximum likelihood (ML) tree phylogeny congruent to neighbor-net network and STRUCTURE results based on RADseq data. In a few clades, we found evidence of discordant patterns indicated by quartet sampling (QS) and reticulation events in the neighbor-net network probably caused by introgression and ILS. Together with coalescent-based species delimitation approaches based on target enrichment data, we found five main genetic lineages, with an allopatric distribution in Central and Southern Europe.

Wild-type and RIP1 kinase-dead (Rip1K45A/K45A) mice were fed with methionine-and choline-deficient diet (MCD) or high-fat diet (HFD) to establish distinct NASH models. In both models, compared to WT mice, Rip1K45A/K45A mice exhibited significantly less liver injury, less steatosis, decreased inflammation, and less cell death in liver tissue. Moreover, hepatic fibrosis as characterized by Sirius Red staining, expression of -SMA and other fibrosis markers, were significantly alleviated in Rip1K45A/K45A mice than WT controls. Furthermore, using bone marrow transplantation to create chimeric mice, we found that it is the RIP1 kinase in hematopoietic-derived macrophages contributing mostly to the disease progression in NASH. Results from in vitro studies were in agreement with the in vivo data, demonstrating that RIP1 kinase was required for inflammasome activation and cell death induced by saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid) in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). At last, we also found that the phosphorylation and expression of RIP1 was obviously increased in patients with NAFLD or NASH, but not in healthy controls.

Collectively, these data suggest that TCF-1 controls the stem-like memory properties of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells and provides a rationale for enhancing this pathway in T cell-based therapeutic strategies for HIV.

The role of MAIT cells within granulomas and other sites of Mtb infection is relatively unknown. Furthermore, how HIV/SIV infection might impair MAIT cells at the sites of Mtb infection has not been determined. Using a Mauritian cynomolgus macaque (MCM) model system, we phenotyped MAIT cells in the peripheral blood and BAL prior to and during infection with SIVmac239. To characterize the role of MAIT cells within granulomas, SIV+ and -naive MCM were infected with a low dose of Mtb for 6 weeks. MAIT cell frequency and function was examined within the peripheral blood, distal airways, as well as within Mtb-affected lymph nodes (LN) and tissues. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of MAIT cell responsiveness to Mtb within granulomas. Additionally, MAIT cells only minimally responded to mycobacterial stimulus in ex vivo functional assays. In contrast, most MAIT cell activation seemed to occur in samples with highly active SIV replication, including blood and SIV-infected LN. Finally, the ability of MAIT cells to secrete TNF (TNF) was impaired during SIV and Mtb co-infection, indicating that the two pathogens together could have a synergistically deleterious effect on MAIT cell function. The effect of this functional impairment on overall TB disease burden was unclear, but might be deleterious if MAIT cells are needed to fully activate antimycobacterial immune cells within the granulomas.","NA"

An accurate and specific method for diagnosing DMD in its earliest stages is needed to prevent progressive muscle degeneration and death. Current methods for diagnosing DMD are often laborious, expensive, invasive, and typically diagnose the disease later on it is progression. In an effort to improve the accuracy and ease of diagnosis, this study focused on developing a novel method for diagnosing DMD which combines Raman hyperspectroscopic analysis of blood serum with advanced statistical analysis. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), was applied to the spectral dataset acquired from control and mdx blood serum of 3- and 12-month old mice to build a diagnostic algorithm. Internal cross-validation showed 95.2% sensitivity and 94.6% specificity for identifying diseased spectra. These results were verified using external validation, which achieved 100% successful classification efficiency at the level of individual donor.

We have functionally characterized a high-affinity sulphate transporter (PiSulT) from an endophytic fungus Serendipita indica. The PiSulT belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of membrane transporter. The PiSulT functionally complements the yeast sulphate transporter mutant HK14. PiSulT is a high-affinity sulphate transporter, having Km 15M. We found enhanced expression of PiSulT in external fungal hyphae which helps the fungus in the acquisition of sulphate from the soil. When knockdown (KD)-PiSulT-P.indica colonized with the plant, it results in an 8-fold reduction in the transfer of sulphate to the colonized plants as compared to the plants colonized with the WT S. indica, which suggests that PiSulT is playing a role in sulphate transfer from soil to host plant. Further, plants colonized with the WT S. indica were found to be healthy in comparison to the plants colonized with the KD-PiSulT-P.indica. Additionally, S. indica colonization provides a positive effect on total sulfur content and on plant metabolites like sulfate ions and glutathione, particularly under low sulphate condition. We observed that the expression of sulfur assimilation pathway genes of S. indica and plant is dependent on the availability of sulphate and on the colonization with the plant. Our study highlights the importance of PiSulT in the improvement of sulfur nutrition of host plant particularly under low sulphate condition and in plant growth development. This study will open new vistas to use S. indica as a bio-fertilizer in the sulphate deficient field to improve crop production.

Here, we used genome-wide association on the largest collection of N. gonorrhoeae isolates to date (n=4882) to identify loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the efflux pump mtrCDE operon as a mechanism of increased antibiotic susceptibility and demonstrate that these mutations are overrepresented in cervical isolates relative to urethral isolates (odds ratio (OR) = 3.74, 95% CI [1.98-6.70]). In support of a model in which pump expression incurs a fitness cost in this niche, cervical isolates were also enriched relative to urethral isolates in LOF mutations in the mtrCDE activator mtrA (OR = 8.60, 95% CI [4.96-14.57]) and in farA, a subunit of the FarAB efflux pump (OR = 6.25, 95% CI [3.90-9.83]). In total, approximately 1 in 3 cervical isolates (36.4%) contained a LOF mutation in either the efflux pump components mtrC or farA or the activator mtrA. Our findings extend beyond N. gonorrhoeae to other Neisseria: mtrC LOF mutations are rare (<1%) in the primarily nasopharyngeal-colonizing N. meningitidis in a collection of 14,798 genomes but enriched in a heterosexual urethritis-associated lineage (8.6%, p = 9.90x10-5), indicating that efflux pump downregulation contributes broadly to the adaptation of pathogenic Neisseria to the female urogenital tract.

We surveyed microsatellite and mitochondrial genetic variation from 143 high-quality museum specimens of known provenance and combined them with data from recently published nuclear and mitochondrial studies. Analysis of variation at 9 microsatellites and 280 polymorphic mitogenome SNPs indicate the presence of male-mediated gene flow and recent isolation of local subpopulations, likely due to habitat fragmentation. Nuclear markers showed a significant decrease in genetic diversity from the historical (HE=0.833) to the modern (HE=0.796) populations, while mitochondrial genetic diversity was maintained (Hd=0.98 for both). While the historical population appears to have been panmictic based on nDNA data, hierarchical structure analysis identified four tiers of fine structure in modern populations, able to detect most sampling locations. Mitochondrial analyses identified 4 clusters: Southern, Mixed, Eastern, and Western; and were consistent between modern and historically sampled haplotypes. Within the last century, habitat fragmentation caused lion subpopulations to become more isolated as human expansion changed the African landscape. This resulted in an increase in fine-scale nuclear genetic structure and loss of genetic diversity as subpopulations became more differentiated, while mitochondrial structure and diversity was maintained over time.","NA"

Cowpea encodes two functional CENH3 variants (CENH3.1 and CENH3.2) and two CENH3 pseudogenes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that gene duplication of CENH3 occurred independently during the speciation of V. unguiculata and the related V. mungo without a genome duplication event. Both functional cowpea CENH3 variants are transcribed, and the corresponding proteins are intermingled in subdomains of different types of centromere sequences in a tissue-specific manner together with the outer kinetochore protein CENPC. CENH3.2 is removed from the generative cell of mature pollen, while CENH3.1 persists. Differences between both CENH3 paralogs are restricted to the N-terminus. The complete CRISPR/Cas9-based inactivation of CENH3.1 resulted in delayed vegetative growth and sterility, indicating that this variant is needed for plant development and reproduction. By contrast, CENH3.2 knockout individuals did not show obvious defects during vegetative and reproductive development, suggesting that the gene is an early stage of subfunctionalization or pseudogenization.

Therefore, we hypothesized that these bacteria are not antagonistic against wood-rot fungi whereas antagonistic activity against other bacteria may be high (resource competition). This was examined for decaying wood in temperate forests. We found that the abundance of cultivable bacteria in decaying wood can be highly variable. The general pattern is an increase of bacteria with progressive decay, but we also identified several fungi that were apparently able to exclude bacteria from their woody territory. We established a bacterial collection which is highly representative for decaying wood with typical wood-inhabiting taxa: Xanthomonadaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Caulobacteraceae, Methylovirgula, Sphingomonas, Burkholderia and Granulicella. In vitro antagonistic activity against other bacteria and fungi was evaluated.

The mutation in AtD14 caused a substitution of the catalytic Ser-97 to Phe in the enzyme active site. The lesion in MAX1 changed a highly conserved Gly-469 to Arg in the haem-iron ligand signature of the cytochrome P450 protein, which caused loss-of-function of MAX1. nCounter-based transcriptional analysis suggested an interaction between SL and sugar signalling in controlling dark-induced inflorescence senescence. The results uncover an important function for SL in regulating floral organ senescence in addition to its other diverse functions in plant development and stress response.

Since its domestication in the inner Niger delta ca. 2500 years BP, African rice has colonized a variety of ecologically and climatically diverse regions. However, little is known about the genetic basis of quantitative traits and adaptive variation of agricultural interest for this species.

ResultsUsing a reference set of 163 fully re-sequenced accessions, we report the results of a Genome Wide Association Study carried out for African rice. We investigated a diverse panel of traits, including flowering date, panicle architecture and resistance to Rice yellow mottle virus. For this, we devised a pipeline using complementary statistical association methods. First, using flowering time as a target trait, we demonstrated that we could successfully retrieve known genes from the rice flowering pathway, and identified new genomic regions that would deserve more study. Then we applied our pipeline to panicle- and resistance-related traits, highlighting some interesting QTLs and candidate genes (including Rymv1 for resistance and SP1, Ghd7.1, APO1 and OsMADS1 for panicle architecture). Lastly, using a high-resolution climate database, we performed an association analysis based on climatic variables, searching for genomic regions that might be involved in adaptation to climatic variations.

To analyze human Purkinje cell (PC) differentiation, we optimized a protocol to generate hPSC-PCs that formed synapses when cultured with mouse cerebellar glia and granule cells and fired large calcium currents, measured with the genetically encoded calcium indicator jRGECO1a. To directly compare global gene expression of hPSC-PCs with developing mouse PCs, we used translating ribosomal affinity purification (TRAP). As a first step, we used Tg(Pcp2-L10a-Egfp) TRAP mice to profile actively transcribed genes in developing postnatal mouse PCs, and used metagene projection to identify the most salient patterns of PC gene expression over time. We then created a transgenic Pcp2-L10a-Egfp TRAP hESC line to profile gene expression in differentiating hPSC-PCs, finding that the key gene expression pathways of differentiated hPSC-PCs most closely matched those of late juvenile, mouse PCs (P21). Comparative bioinformatics identified classical PC gene signatures as well as novel mitochondrial and autophagy gene pathways during the differentiation of both mouse and human PCs. In addition, we identified genes expressed in hPSC-PCs but not mouse PCs and confirmed protein expression of a novel human PC gene, CD40LG, expressed in both hPSC-PCs and native human cerebellar tissue. This study therefore provides the first direct comparison of hPSC-PC and mouse PC gene expression and a robust method for generating differentiated hPSC-PCs with human-specific gene expression for modeling developmental and degenerative cerebellar disorders.

Metagene projection analysis of mouse PC gene expression over postnatal development identified both classical PC marker genes as well as novel mitochondrial and autophagy gene pathways. These key gene expression patterns were conserved in differentiating hPSC-PCs. We further identified differences in timing and expression of key gene sets between mouse and hPSC-PCs and confirmed expression of a novel human PC marker, CD40LG, in human cerebellar tissue.","NA"

Various levels of TaCKX1 silencing in both generations influence different models of co-expression with other TaCKX genes and parameters of yield-related traits. Only a high level of silencing in T2 resulted in strong down-regulation of TaCKX11 (3), up-regulation of TaCKX2.1, 2.2, 5 and 9 (10), and a high yielding phenotype. This phenotype is characterised by higher spike number, grain number and grain yield, as well as slightly higher mass of seedling roots, but lower thousand grain weight (TGW) and slightly lower spike length. Content of most of cytokinin forms in 7 DAP spikes of silenced T2 lines increased from 40 to 76% compared to the non-silenced control. The CKs cross talk with other phytohormones.

Irrespective of treatment, DNA methylation was primarily found in gene bodies with approximately 22% of CpGs (2.7% of total cytosines) in the C. virginica genome predicted to be methylated. In response to elevated pCO2, we found 598 differentially methylated loci primarily overlapping with gene bodies. A majority of differentially methylated loci were in exons (61.5%) with less intron overlap (31.9%). While there was no evidence of a significant tendency for the genes with differentially methylated loci to be associated with distinct biological processes, the concentration of these loci in gene bodies, including genes involved in protein ubiquitination and biomineralization suggests DNA methylation may be important for transcriptional control in response to ocean acidification. Changes in gonad methylation also indicate potential for these methylation patterns to be inherited by offspring. Understanding how experimental ocean acidification conditions modify the oyster epigenome, and if these modifications are inherited, allows for a better understanding of how ecosystems will respond to environmental change.","NA"

In dense cultures, cells closest to the light source absorb more light energy than they can use and dissipate the excess, while light penetrance into the culture is steeply attenuated. Reducing microalgal light harvesting and/or dissipating capacity per cell may improve total light utilization efficiency in mass cultures. In this study, two transgenic lines of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana with altered photosynthetic pigment content are evaluated with respect to photosynthetic parameters, growth, and macromolecule accumulation. In one line, violaxanthin de-epoxidase-like 2 (VDL2) is overexpressed (OE), resulting in a reduction of the diadinoxanthin cycle pigments, which are involved in light energy dissipation (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ), accompanied by a stoichiometric increase in the light-harvesting pigment fucoxanthin. No differences in the maximum potential quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) or light-limited photosynthetic rate () were found. However, when adapted to 30 {micro}mol photons m-2 sec-1, the VDL2 OE maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) upon exposure to saturating light intensities was 86-95% of wild type (WT). When adapted to 300 {micro}mol photons m-2 sec-1, VDL2 OE saturated photosynthesis at 62-71% of the light intensity needed to saturate WT (Ek). NPQ was substantially lower at and below 300 {micro}mol photons m-2 sec-1. VDL2 OE accumulated up to 3.4 times as much triacylglycerol (TAG) as WT during exponential growth, and up to twice as much protein. Growth in terms of culture density was up to 7% slower. TAG and protein accumulation inversely correlated with NPQ. The second line evaluated was obtained by using antisense RNA to simultaneously silence or knock down (KD) both LUT1-like (LTL) genes, hypothesized to catalyze an intermediate carotenoid biosynthesis step of converting {beta}-carotene to zeaxanthin. Overall reduction of photosynthetic pigment content without altering the relative abundance of individual pigments resulted. No significant differences in photosynthetic parameters compared to WT were found. LTL KD grew at a rate comparable to WT and accumulated up to 40% more TAG during exponential growth, while protein content was reduced by 11-19%. LTL KD cells were elongated and 5-10% smaller than WT, and cultures contained auxospores, indicating stress that may relate to a cell cycle progression defect.","NA"

With the recent advancements in sequencing techniques, sufficient genomic data has become available to train models that predict the evolutionary statistical energies, but there is still inadequate experimental data to directly predict functional effects. One approach to overcome this data scarcity is to apply transfer learning and train more models with available datasets. In this study, we propose a set of transfer learning algorithms we call TLmutation, which implements a supervised transfer learning algorithm that transfers knowledge from survival data of a protein to a particular function of that protein. This is followed by an unsupervised transfer learning algorithm that extends the knowledge to a homologous protein. We explore the application of our algorithms in three cases. First, we test the supervised transfer on 17 previously published deep mutagenesis datasets to complete and refine missing datapoints. We further investigate these datasets to identify which mutations build better predictors of variant functions. In the second case, we apply the algorithm to predict higher-order mutations solely from single point mutagenesis data. Finally, we perform the unsupervised transfer learning algorithm to predict mutational effects of homologous proteins from experimental datasets. These algorithms are generalized to transfer knowledge between Markov random field models. We show the benefit of our transfer learning algorithms to utilize informative deep mutational data and provide new insights into protein variant functions. As these algorithms are generalized to transfer knowledge between Markov random field models, we expect these algorithms to be applicable to other disciplines.","NA"

Among these, precise regulation of 5 Hox transcription factor expression is essential for proper limb bud patterning and elaboration of distinct limb skeletal elements. Here, we identified Geminin (Gmnn) as a novel regulator of this process. A conditional model of Gmnn deficiency resulted in loss or severe reduction of forelimb skeletal elements, while both the forelimb autopod and hindlimb were unaffected. 5 Hox gene expression expanded into more proximal and anterior regions of the embryonic forelimb buds in this Gmnn-deficient model. A second conditional model of Gmnn deficiency instead caused a similar but less severe reduction of hindlimb skeletal elements and hindlimb polydactyly, while not affecting the forelimb. An ectopic posterior SHH signaling center was evident in the anterior hindlimb bud of Gmnn-deficient embryos in this model. This center ectopically expressed Hoxd13, the HOXD13 target Shh, and the SHH target Ptch1, while these mutant hindlimb buds also had reduced levels of the cleaved, repressor form of GLI3, a SHH pathway antagonist. Together, this work delineates a new role for Gmnn in modulating Hox expression to pattern the vertebrate limb.

For host and parasite communities in the Southern Ocean, investigations of many major groups of parasites have largely been limited to taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, creating an urgent need for the collection of baseline ecological data if we are to detect changes in host-parasite interactions in the future. Here, we survey three species of Crocodile icefish (Notothenioidei: Channichthyidae) collected from two island archipelagos in Antarcticas South Scotia Arc region for evidence of leech infestations. Specifically, we report on infestation prevalence and intensity of three leech species (Trulliobdella bacilliformis, Trulliobdella capitis, and Nototheniobdella sawyeri) on the host fish species Chaenocephalus aceratus, Champsocephalus gunnari, and Chionodraco rastrospinosus. Additionally, we characterize spatial patterns of relative abundances of each leech species across the Elephant and South Orkney Islands, size distribution of parasitized fish, and patterns of host and attachment site specificity. Our results reveal high levels of attachment area fidelity for each leech species. These results suggest skin thickness and density of the vascular network constrain leech attachment sites and further suggest trophic transmission to be an important axis of parasitization. We also demonstrate that, while leech species appear to be clustered spatially, this clustering does not appear to be correlated with fish biomass. This study illuminates the complex interactions among fish hosts and leech parasites in the Southern Ocean and lays the groundwork for future studies of Antarctic marine leech ecology that can aid in forecasting how host-parasite interactions may shift in the face of ongoing climate change.","10.1007/s00300-020-02670-x"

An alternative approach is to estimate ancestral character states independently of rates using parsimony and to then condition likelihood-based estimates of transition rates on the resulting ancestor-descendant reconstructions. We use maximum parsimony reconstructions of possible pathways of evolution to implement this alternative approach for single-character datasets simulated on empirical phylogenies using a two-state CTMC. We find that transition rates estimated using parsimonious ancestor-descendant reconstructions have lower mean squared error than transition rates estimated by maximum average likelihood. Although we use a binary state character for exposition, the approach remains valid for an arbitrary number of states. Finally, we show how this method can be used to rapidly and easily detect phylogenetic variation in tempo and mode of character evolution with two empirical examples from squamates.

We developed RECAS9 as a transgene-free approach for precisely targeting recombination events by delivering CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleotide protein (RNP) complex into heterozygous mitotic cells for the barley (Hordeum vulgare) Heat3.1 locus. A wild species (H. spontaneum) introgression in this region carries the agronomical unfavourable tough rachis phenotype (non-brittle) allele linked with a circadian clock accelerating QTL near GIGANTEA gene. We delivered RNP, which was targeted between two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), to mitotic calli cells by particle bombardment. We estimated recombination events by next generation sequencing (NGS) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). While NGS analysis grieved from confounding effects of PCR recombination, ddPCR analysis allowed us to associate RNP treatment on heterozygous individuals with significant increase of homologous directed repair (HDR) between cultivated and wild alleles, with recombination rate ranging between zero to 57%. These results show for the first time in plants a directed and transgene free mitotic recombination driven by Cas9 RNP, and provide a starting point for precise breeding and fine scale mapping of beneficial alleles from crop wild relatives.","NA"

Day length has been shown to impact plant-oomycete interactions but a need exists for a tractable reference system to understand the mechanistic interplay between light regulation, oomycete pathogen virulence, and plant host immunity. Here we present data demonstrating that light is a critical factor in the interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and its naturally occurring downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa). We investigated the role of light on spore germination, mycelium development, sporulation and oospore formation of Hpa, along with defence responses in the host. We observed abundant Hpa sporulation on compatible Arabidopsis under day lengths ranging from 10 to 14 hours. Contrastingly, exposure to constant light or constant dark suppressed sporulation. Exposure to constant dark suppressed spore germination, mycelial development and oospore formation. Interestingly, exposure to constant light stimulated spore germination, mycelial development and oospore formation. A biomarker of plant immune system activation was induced under both constant light and constant dark. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that Hpa has the molecular mechanisms to perceive and respond to light and that both the host and pathogen responses are influenced by the light regime. Therefore, this pathosystem can be used for investigations to understand the molecular mechanisms through which oomycete pathogens like Hpa perceive and integrate light signals, and how light influences pathogen virulence and host immunity during their interactions.","NA"

Here, re-analysis of these and other publicly available data, capillary electrophoresis experiments on chemically modified RNAs, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on A12 and variants show that this effect is unlikely to arise from an unusual structure of polyadenosine.

Here, single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrates that cargo-loaded SRP induces a global compaction of SR, driving a >90 [A] movement of the SRP*SR GTPase complex from the vicinity of the ribosome exit, where it initially assembles, to the distal site of SRP. These rearrangements bring translating ribosomes near the membrane, expose conserved Sec61p docking sites on the ribosome and weaken SRPs interaction with the signal sequence on the nascent polypeptide, thus priming the translating ribosome for engaging the translocation machinery.

Taking advantage of large genomic datasets in which the expression of both mature miRNAs and their host genes have been quantified, we establish and validate transcriptional and post-transcriptional metrics, with miRNA host gene expression estimating transcriptional regulation and mature miRNA to host gene ratio estimating post-transcriptional regulation. On average, the post-transcriptional metric contributes 2.8-fold more than the transcriptional metric to the variance of mature miRNA expression. The variation of the balance between the two mature miRNAs (5p and 3p miRNAs) produced from the same precursor hairpin is a non-negligible contributor to miRNA expression, explaining [~]27% of the variance of miRNAs post-transcriptional metric. Data of normal tissues yield similar results as cancer specimens. Additionally, the post-transcriptional metric is superior to the transcriptional metric in classifying cancer types.

Here we show that the balance between SAC strength and responsiveness is determined by the number of  MELT motifs in the kinetochore protein Spc105/KNL1 and their Bub3-Bub1 binding affinities. Spc105/KNL1 must contain many strong MELT motifs to prevent chromosome missegregation, but not too many, because this delays SAC silencing and anaphase onset. We demonstrate this by constructing a Spc105 variant that trades SAC responsiveness for significantly improved chromosome segregation accuracy. We propose that the necessity of balancing SAC strength with responsiveness drives the evolutionary trend of MELT motif number amplification and degeneration of their functionally optimal amino acid sequence.","NA"

One prominent behavioral response is increased locomotor activities upon starvation, also known as Starvation-Induced Hyperactivity (SIH). SIH is paradoxical as it promotes food seeking but also increases energy expenditure. Either too much or too little SIH would impair fitness. Despite its importance, the genetic contributions to SIH as a behavioral trait remains unexplored. Here, we examined SIH in the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and performed genome-wide association studies. We identified 27 significant loci, corresponding to 18 genes, significantly associated with SIH in adult Drosophila. Gene enrichment analyses indicated that genes encoding ion channels and mRNA binding proteins (RBPs) were most enriched in SIH. We are especially interested in RBPs because they provide a potential mechanism to quickly change protein expression in response to environmental challenges. Using RNA interference, we validated the role of Syp in regulating SIH. Syp encodes Syncrip, an RBP. While ubiquitous knockdown of Syp led to lethality during development, adult flies with neuron specific Syp knockdown were viable and exhibited decreased SIH. Using the Temporal and Regional Gene Expression Targeting (TARGET) system, we further confirmed the role of Syp in adult neurons in regulating SIH. Lastly, RNA-seq analyses revealed that Syp was alternatively spliced under starvation while its expression level was unchanged. Together, this study not only demonstrates genetic contributions to SIH as an important behavioral trait but also highlights the significance of RBPs and post-transcriptional processes in regulating SIH.","NA"

Modern computational techniques (i.e., public code and data repositories, continuous integration, containerization) enable the reproducibility of the analyses and reduce coding errors, but they do not guarantee the scientific validity of the results. It is difficult, nay impossible, for researchers to check the accuracy of software by reading the source code; ground truth test datasets are needed. Computational reproducibility means providing software so that for the same input anyone obtains the same result, right or wrong. Computational validity means obtaining the right result for the ground-truth test data. We describe a framework for validating and sharing software implementations. We apply the framework to an application: population receptive field (pRF) methods for functional MRI data. The framework is composed of three main components implemented with containerization methods to guarantee computational reproducibility: (1) synthesis of fMRI time series from ground-truth pRF parameters, (2) implementation of four public pRF analysis tools and standardization of inputs and outputs, and (3) report creation to compare the results with the ground truth parameters. We identified realistic conditions that lead to imperfect parameter recovery in all four implementations, and we provide means to reduce this problem. The computational validity framework supports scientific rigor and creativity, as opposed to the oft-repeated suggestion that investigators rely upon a few agreed upon packages. The framework and methods can be extended to other critical neuroimaging algorithms. Having validation frameworks help (1) developers to build new software, (2) research scientists to verify the softwares accuracy, and (3) reviewers to evaluate the methods used in publications and grants.

Author SummaryComputer science provides powerful tools and techniques for implementing and deploying software. These techniques support software collaboration, reduce coding errors and enable reproducibility of the analyses. A further question is whether the software estimates are correct (valid). We describe a framework for validating and sharing software implementations based on ground-truth testing. We applied the framework to four separate applications that implemented population receptive field (pRF) estimates for functional MRI data. We quantified the validity, and we also documented limitations with these applications. Finally, we provide ways to mitigate these limitations. Implementing a software validation framework along with sharing and reproducibility is an important step for the complex methods used in neuroscience. Validation will help developers to build new software, researchers verify that the results are valid, and reviewers to evaluate the precision of methods in publications and grants.","NA"

Most studies of SHANK3 in the neocortex and hippocampus have focused on disturbances in pyramidal neurons. However, GABAergic interneurons likewise receive excitatory inputs and presumably would also be a target of constitutive SHANK3 perturbations. In this study, we characterize the prefrontal cortical microcircuit in awake mice using subcellular-resolution two-photon microscopy. We focused on a nonsense R1117X mutation, which leads to truncated SHANK3 and has been linked previously to cortical dysfunction. We find that R1117X mutants have abnormally elevated calcium transients in apical dendritic spines. The synaptic calcium dysregulation is due to a loss of dendritic inhibition via decreased NMDAR currents and reduced firing of dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SST) GABAergic interneurons. Notably, upregulation of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B in SST interneurons corrects the excessive synaptic calcium signals and ameliorates learning deficits in R1117X mutants. These findings reveal dendrite-targeting interneurons, and more broadly the inhibitory control of dendritic spines, as a key microcircuit mechanism compromised by the SHANK3 dysfunction.","10.1038/s41380-020-0708-6"

Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV.

Author SummaryInfectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets.","NA"

This silencing was initiated by Alternative Transposition (AT), a type of aberrant transposition event that engages the termini of two nearby separate TEs. AT during DNA replication can generate Composite Insertions (CIs) that contain inverted duplications of the transposon sequences. We show that the inverted duplications of two CIs are transcribed to produce dsRNAs that trigger the production of two distinct classes of siRNAs: a 24-nt class complementary to the TE terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and non-coding sub-terminal regions, and a 21-22 nt class corresponding to the TE transcribed regions. Plants containing these siRNA-generating CIs exhibit decreased levels of Ac transcript and heritable repression of Ac/Ds transposition. This study documents the first case of TE silencing attributable to transposon self-initiated AT and may represent a general initiating mechanism for silencing of DNA transposons.

This report demonstrates the value of prospectively collected genomic data for verifying CIDT targets.

We utilised the genomes of 3165 Salmonella isolates prospectively collected and sequenced in Australia. The sequence of Salmonella CIDT PCR gene targets (ttrA, spaO and invA) were systematically interrogated to measure nucleotide dissimilarity. Analysis of 52 different serovars and 79 MLST types demonstrated dissimilarity within and between PCR gene targets ranging between 0 - 81.3 SNP/Kbp (0 and 141 SNPs). Lowest average dissimilarity was observed in the ttrA target gene used by the Roche LightMix at 2.0 SNP/Kbp [range 0 - 46.7]), however entropy across the gene demonstrates it may not be the most stable CIDT target.

While debate continues over the benefits and pitfalls of replacing bacterial culture with molecular assays, the growing volumes of genomic surveillance data enable periodic regional reassessment and validation of CIDT targets against both prevalent and emerging serovars. If PCR systems are to become the primary screening and diagnostic tool for laboratory diagnosis of salmonellosis, ongoing monitoring of the genomic diversity in PCR target regions is warranted as is the potential inclusion of two Salmonella PCR targets into frontline diagnostic systems.","NA"

First, we knocked down Fyn selectively in DMS dMSNs or iMSNs of mice and measured the level of alcohol consumption. We found that downregulation of Fyn in dMSNs, but not in iMSNs, reduces excessive alcohol but not saccharin intake and preference. D1Rs are coupled to Gs/olf, which activate cAMP signaling. To examine whether Fyns actions are mediated through cAMP signaling, DMS dMSNs were infected with GsDREADD, and the activation of Fyn signaling was measured following CNO treatment. We found that remote stimulation of cAMP signaling in DMS dMSNs activates Fyn and promotes the phosphorylation of the Fyn substrate, GluN2B. Next, we tested whether remote activation of GsDREADD in DMS dMSNs or iMSNs alters alcohol intake, and observed that CNO-dependent activation of GsDREADD in DMS dMSNs but not iMSNs increases alcohol but not saccharin intake and preference. Finally, we examined the contribution of Fyn to GsDREADD-dependent increase in alcohol intake, and found that systemic administration of the Fyn inhibitor, AZD0503 blocks GsDREADD-dependent increase in alcohol consumption.

Since GRNs provide information that is essential for understanding cell function, the inference of these networks is one of the key challenges in systems biology. Leading algorithms to reconstruct GRN utilize, in addition to gene expression data, prior knowledge such as Transcription Factor (TF) DNA binding motifs or results of DNA binding experiments. However, such prior knowledge is typically incomplete hence resulting in missing values. Therefore, the integration of such incomplete prior knowledge with gene expression to elucidate the underlying GRNs remains difficult.

To address this challenge we introduce NetREX-CF - Regulatory Network Reconstruction using EXpression and Collaborative Filtering - a GRN reconstruction approach that brings together a modern machine learning strategy (Collaborative Filtering model) and a biologically justified model of gene expression (sparse Network Component Analysis based model). The Collaborative Filtering (CF) model is able to overcome the incompleteness of the prior knowledge and make edge recommends for building the GRN. Complementing CF, the sparse Network Component Analysis (NCA) model can use gene expression data to validate the recommended edges. Here we combine these two approaches using a novel data integration method and show that the new approach outperforms the currently leading GRN reconstruction methods.

Furthermore, our mathematical formalization of the model has lead to a complex optimization problem of a type that has not been attempted before.

This can be accomplished through metaproteomics, which characterizes the protein complement of the microbiome. Several software tools exist for analyzing microbiomes at the functional level by measuring their combined proteome-level response to environmental perturbations. In this survey, we explore the performance of six available tools, so that researchers can make informed decisions regarding software choice based on their research goals.

Tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data obtained from dental carie plaque samples grown with and without sucrose in paired biofilm reactors were used as representative data for this evaluation. Microbial peptides from one sample pair were identified by the X! Tandem search algorithm via SearchGUI and subjected to functional analysis using software tools including eggNOG-mapper, MEGAN6, MetaGOmics, MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA), ProPHAnE, and Unipept to generate functional annotation through Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

Among these software tools, notable differences in functional annotation were detected after comparing differentially expressed protein functional groups. Based on the generated GO terms of these tools we performed a peptide-level comparison to evaluate the quality of their functional annotations. A BLAST analysis against the Universal Protein Knowledgebase revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of functional annotation differed between tools. For example, eggNOG-mapper mapped to the most number of GO terms, while Unipept generated the most precise GO terms. Based on our evaluation, metaproteomics researchers can choose the software according to their analytical needs and developers can use the resulting feedback to further optimize their algorithms. To make more of these tools accessible via scalable metaproteomics workflows, eggNOG-mapper and Unipept 4.0 were incorporated into the Galaxy platform.","NA"

In the course of our study on mesothelioma, we identified a highly specific tumor cell surface antigen that can be targeted for therapy development. Mesothelioma is caused by malignant transformation of the mesothelium, incurable and categorized into three histological subtypes, epithelioid, biphasic and sarcomatoid. To identity novel mesothelioma cell surface antigens with broad subtype coverage and high tissue specificity, we have previously selected phage antibody display libraries on live mesothelioma cells and tissues following counter-selection on normal cells, and identified a panel of human antibodies that bind all subtypes of mesothelioma but not normal mesothelium. One of the antibodies, M25, showed high specificity, and we hereby report the identification of the M25 antigen as ALPPL2. We performed immunohistochemistry on normal human tissues and found that ALPPL2 is expressed only on placental trophoblasts but not any other normal tissues. This exquisite tissue specificity and broad tumor type coverage suggests that ALPPL2 could be an excellent cell surface target for therapeutic development against mesothelioma. To evaluate therapeutic potential of ALPPL2 targeting, we developed an ALPPL2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate and demonstrated potent and specific tumor killing in vitro and in vivo against both epithelioid and sarcomatoid mesothelioma. Thus ALPPL2 belongs to a rare class of cell surface antigens that can be said as being truly tumor specific and is well suited for therapy development against ALPPL2 expressing tumors.","NA"

Understanding the causes and consequences of this variation depends critically on accounting for heterogeneity in rates of trait evolution among lineages. Here, we describe a method for modeling among-lineage evolutionary rate heterogeneity in a trait with two discrete states. The method assumes that the present-day distribution of a binary trait is shaped by a mixture of stochastic processes in which the rate of evolution varies among lineages in a phylogeny. The number and location of rate changes, which we refer to as rate-shift events, are inferred automatically from the data. Simulations reveal that the method accurately reconstructs rates of trait evolution and ancestral character states even when simulated data violate model assumptions. We apply the method to an empirical dataset of mimetic coloration in snakes and find elevated rates of trait evolution in two clades of harmless snakes that are broadly sympatric with dangerously venomous New World coral snakes, recapitulating an earlier analysis of the same dataset. Although the method performed well on many simulated data sets, we caution that overall power for inferring heterogeneous dynamics of single binary traits is low.","NA"

While certain specific aspects of water flow processing have been revealed through electrophysiology, we lack a comprehensive description of the neurons that respond to water flow and the network that they form. Here, we use brain-wide calcium imaging in combination with microfluidic stimulation to map out, at cellular resolution, all neurons involved in perceiving and processing water flow information in larval zebrafish. We find a diverse array of neurons responding to forward flow, reverse flow, or both. Early in this pathway, in the lateral line ganglia, these are almost exclusively neurons responding to the simple presence of forward or reverse flow, but later processing includes neurons responding specifically to flow onset, representing the accumulated volume of flow during a stimulus, or encoding the speed of the flow. The neurons reporting on these more nuanced details are located across numerous brain regions, including some not previously implicated in water flow processing. A graph theory-based analysis of the brain-wide water flow network shows that a majority of this processing is dedicated to forward flow detection, and this is reinforced by our finding that details like flow velocity and the total volume of accumulated flow are only encoded for the simulated forward direction. The results represent the first brain-wide description of processing for this important modality, and provide a departure point for more detailed studies of the flow of information through this network.

Significance statementIn aquatic animals, the lateral line is important for detecting water flow stimuli, but the brain networks that interpret this information remain mysterious. Here, we have imaged the activity of individual neurons across the entire brains of larval zebrafish, revealing all response types and their brain locations as water flow processing occurs. We find some neurons that respond to the simple presence of water flow, and others that are attuned to the flows direction, speed, duration, or the accumulated volume of water that has passed during the stimulus. With this information, we modeled the underlying network, describing a system that is nuanced in its processing of water flow simulating forward motion but rudimentary in processing flow in the reverse direction.","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0049-20.2020"

Because these three arboviruses coexist in Mexico, the frequency and severity of GBS could theoretically increase. This study aimed to determine the association between these arboviruses and GBS in a Mexican population, and to establish the clinical features of the patients, including the severity of the infection.

Methodology/Principal findingsA case-control study was conducted (2016/07/01-2018/06/30) in hospitals from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social. Serum and urine samples were collected to determine the exposure to ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV by RT-qPCR and serology (IgM). The association between arboviral infection and GBS was analysed with {chi}2 or exact Fisher tests and Kruskall-Wallis folloed by Mann Whitney U test for comparing symptomatology. A p [&le;] 0.05 was considered as significant. Ninety-seven GBS cases and 184 controls were included. Evidence of association of GBS with ZIKV acute infection (OR, 8.04; 95% CI, 0.89-73.01, p =0.047), as well as ZIKV recent infection (OR, 16.68; 95% CI, 2.05-135.31; p = 0.001) and Flavivirus (ZIKV and DENV) recent infection (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.8-18.8; p = 0.002) was observed. Cases with GBS associated with ZIKV demonstrated a greater impairment of functional status, a higher percentage of mechanical ventilation and mortality. Dizziness, ataxia and low blood pressure showed statistically signifant differences in cases with GBS associated with DENV. Co-infection cases were not observed.

Conclusions/SignificanceAccording to the laboratory results, an association between ZIKV or ZIKV and DENV infection in patients with GBS was found. Cases of GBS associated with ZIKV but not with DENV exhibited a more severe clinical picture. Cases with co-infection were not found.

Author summaryDengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV) are considered as emerging or re-emerging viruses. In recent years, these viruses have produced great epidemics in tropical climate urban centers, and have been associated with neurological manifestations, including Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), which causes muscle weakness, unstable gait, and decreased or absent musculoskeletal reflexes. This study aimed to investigate the association between these viral infections and GBS. A case and control study was conducted nationwide, including 97 cases of GBS and 184 controls matched by age, gender, and locality, but without the disease. This study showed the positive association between GBS cases and ZIKV or ZIKV and DENV infection. GBS cases associated with ZIKV showed a more severe clinical picture (more impairment of functional status and incapacity, a higher percentage of mechanical ventilation, and mortality). GBS associated with DENV cases seemed to show more dizziness, ataxia, and low blood pressure. Finally, the symptoms of ZIKV or DENV suspected disease before the development of GBS were similar to some previous reports. The impact of the interaction of these three arboviruses, particularly ZIKV, on the health of the Mexican population was less than expected. The Mexican experience could be useful for other populations.","NA"

This task is typically addressed by using environmental sequencing data (""metagenomics""). However, determining microbiomes diversity implies the classification of species composition within the sampled community, which is often done via the assignment of individual reads to taxa by comparison to a reference database. Although computational methods aimed at identifying the microbe(s) taxa are available, it is well known that the inference of the community from the same sample using different methods can vary widely depending on the various biases in each step of the analysis. In this study, we compare different bioinformatics methods based on amplicon sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA and whole genome shotgun sequencing for taxonomic classification. We apply the methods to three mock communities of bacteria, of which the composition is known. We show that 16S data reliably allow to detect the number of species, but not the abundances, while standard methods based on shotgun data give a reliable estimate of the most abundant species, but predict a large number of false-positive species. We thus propose a novel approach, that combines shotgun data with a classification based on core protein families (PFAM), hence similar in spirit to 16S. We show that this method reliably predicts both number of species and abundance of the bacterial mock communities.

Author summaryCharacterizing species diversity and composition of bacteria hosted by biota is revolutionizing our understanding and conception of the role of symbiotic interactions in ecosystems. However, determining microbiomes diversity implies the classification of species composition within the sampled community. Although many computational methods aimed at identifying the microbe(s) taxa are available, it is well known that the inference of the community from the same sample using different methods can vary widely depending on the various biases in each step of the analysis. In most of the studies, when benchmarking protocols for taxonomic classification from biological samples, the ""ground truth"" of the contained species and their relative abundances is not known. Therefore, the use of mock communities or simulated datasets remains as basis for a robust comparative evaluation of a methods prediction accuracy. In this work, we first compare different bioinformatics methods for taxonomic classification. We apply the methods to three mock communities of bacteria, of which the composition is known. We show that no method is able to correctly predict both the number of species and their abundances. We then propose a novel approach based on core protein families, reliably inferring both number of species and abundance of the bacterial mock communities.","NA"

First, unlike systemic Akt1 deletion, which inhibits metastasis, cell autonomous Akt1 deletion does not. Second, systemic Akt2 deletion does not inhibit mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis, but cell autonomous Akt2 deletion eliminates ErbB2 expressing cells in the mammary gland and prevents tumorigenesis. However, the elevation in insulin by Akt2 systemic deletion hyperactivates tumor Akt, enabling ErbB2 expression, and exacerbates mammary tumorigenesis. Decreasing insulin level inhibits accelerated tumorigenesis by systemic Akt2 deletion. Single cell mRNA sequencing revealed that systemic Akt1 deletion maintains the pro-metastatic cluster within primary tumors but ablates pro-metastatic neutrophils. Systemic Akt1 deletion inhibits metastasis by impairing the survival and mobilization of tumor-associated neutrophils. Importantly, neutrophil-specific deletion of Akt1 is sufficient to exert resistance to metastasis. The results underscore the importance of determining systemic effects rather than cell autonomous effects as a proof of concept for cancer therapy.","NA"

AMD-associated CFH risk variants, Y402H in particular, impair FH function leading to complement overactivation. In AMD, retinal homeostasis is compromised due to dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Whether FH contributes to AMD pathogenesis only via complement system dysregulation remains unclear. To investigate the potential role of FH on energy metabolism and oxidative stress in RPE cells, we silenced CFH in human hTERT-RPE1 cells. FH-deprived RPE cells exposed to oxidative insult, showed altered metabolic homeostasis, including reduction of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, paralleled by an increase in lipid peroxidation. Our data suggest that FH protects RPE cells from oxidative stress and metabolic reprogramming, highlighting a novel function for FH in AMD pathogenesis.

ObjectivesTo describe abdominal symptoms among pSS patients and to assess their association with characteristics of the disease.

MethodsOne hundred and fifty patients followed at Hospital and University Center of Limoges were prospectively included and were evaluated using a composite global symptom score (GSS) describing abdominal symptoms and their severity. Data concerning the clinical and biological characteristics of the pSS and abdominal disorders were also collected.

ResultsNinety-five per cent of pSS patients suffered from abdominal symptoms with a median GSS of 7.5{+/-}5.5 points out of 30. More than half of the patients experienced abdominal tension (68%), upper abdominal pain (54%), abdominal discomfort (58%) and/or constipation (54%). Regarding the pSS activity ESSDAI score items, general and central nervous system involvement was associated with a high GSS. Regarding the patients symptoms ESSPRI score, there was a positive correlation with the GSS (p<0.01). Multivariate analysis showed a statistical association between a high GSS and seronegative status for SSA, gastroparesis and ESSPRI score (p<0.01 for each one).

ConclusionThis study revealed that more than 90% of pSS patients suffered from abdominal symptoms. There is currently no therapeutic recommendation because of the lack of specific study and comprehension of the physiopathological mechanisms involved.","NA"

However, temporal expectations can be formed not only in response to a regular beat, such as in music (""beat-based"" expectations), but also based on a predictable pattern of temporal intervals of different durations (""memory-based"" expectations). Here, we examined the neural mechanisms underlying beat-based and memory-based expectations, by assessing EEG activity and behavioral responses during silent periods following rhythmic auditory sequences that allowed for beat-based or memory-based expectations, or had random timing. In Experiment 1 (N = 32), participants rated how well probe tones at various time points fitted the previous rhythm. Beat-based expectations affected fitness ratings for at least two beat-cycles, while the effects of memory-based expectations subsided after the first expected time point in the silence window. In Experiment 2 (N = 27), using EEG, we found a CNV following the final tones of memory-based and random, but not beat-based sequences, suggesting that climbing neuronal activity may specifically reflect memory-based expectations. Moreover, we found enhanced power in the EEG signal at the beat frequency for beat-based sequences both during listening and the silence. For memory-based sequences, we found enhanced power at a frequency inherent to the memory-based pattern only during listening, but not during the silence, suggesting that ongoing entrainment of low frequency oscillations may be specific to beat-based expectations. Finally, using multivariate pattern decoding on the raw EEG data, we could classify above chance from the silence which type of sequence participants had heard before. Together, our results suggest that beat-based and memory-based expectations rely on entrainment and climbing neuronal activity, respectively.","NA"

Impaired peroxisomal function can lead to severe metabolic disorders with developmental defects and neurological abnormalities. Recently, a new group of disorders has been identified, characterised by defects in the membrane dynamics and division of peroxisomes rather than by loss of metabolic functions. However, the contribution of impaired peroxisome plasticity to the pathophysiology of those disorders is not well understood. Mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) is a key component of both the peroxisomal and mitochondrial division machinery. Patients with MFF deficiency present with developmental and neurological abnormalities. Peroxisomes (and mitochondria) in patient fibroblasts are highly elongated as a result of impaired organelle division. The majority of studies into MFF-deficiency have focused on mitochondrial dysfunction, but the contribution of peroxisomal alterations to the pathophysiology is largely unknown. Here, we show that MFF deficiency does not cause alterations to overall peroxisomal biochemical function. However, loss of MFF results in reduced import-competency of the peroxisomal compartment and leads to the accumulation of pre-peroxisomal membrane structures. We show that peroxisomes in MFF-deficient cells display alterations in peroxisomal redox state and intra-peroxisomal pH. Removal of elongated peroxisomes through induction of autophagic processes is not impaired. A mathematical model describing key processes involved in peroxisome dynamics sheds further light into the physical processes disturbed in MFF-deficient cells.

These findings suggest that POU4 genes have ancient functions as terminal selectors for morphologically and functionally highly disparate types of neurons and they provide experimental support for the relevance of terminal selectors for understanding the evolution of cell types.","10.1016/j.celrep.2020.03.031"

A pan-Leishmania SYBR Green quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay which specifically detects the conserved spliced-leader RNA (SL-RNA) sequence has recently been developed. This study comparatively assessed the SL-RNA assay performance for the detection of Leishmania in field and laboratory infected sand flies and in tissue samples from hyraxes as reservoir hosts.

Principal findingsThe qPCRs targeting SL-RNA and kDNA performed equally well on infected sand fly samples, despite preservation and extraction under presumed unfavorable conditions for downstream RNA detection. Nucleic acid extraction by a crude extraction buffer combined with a precipitation step was highly compatible with downstream SL-RNA and kDNA detection. Copy numbers of kDNA were found to be identical in culture-derived parasites and promastigotes isolated from sand fly midguts. SL-RNA levels were approximately 3-fold lower in sand fly promastigotes ({Delta}Ct 1.7). The theoretical limit of detection and quantification of the SL-RNA qPCR respectively reached down to 10-3 and 10 parasite equivalents. SL-RNA detection in stored hyrax samples was less efficient with some false negative assay results, most likely due to the long-term tissue storage in absence of RNA stabilizing reagents.

ConclusionThis study shows that a crude extraction method in combination with the SL-RNA qPCR assay is suitable for the detection and quantification of Leishmania in sand flies. The assay provides complementary information to the standard kDNA assays, since it is pan-Leishmania specific and detects viable parasites, a prerequisite for identification of vectors and reservoirs.

Author summaryIn order to identify vectors and reservoirs of Leishmania, a large number of sand fly and animal tissue samples needs to be screened, because the infection prevalence is generally low. Hence, sensitive low-cost methods are required for nucleic acid isolation and Leishmania detection. Most approaches amplify DNA targets, in particular minicircle kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). Recently, a qPCR was developed that detects the spliced-leader RNA (SL-RNA) sequence, which is conserved among various Leishmania species and allows detection of viable parasites. We show that the SL-RNA qPCR is highly compatible with a low-cost, crude extraction approach and performs equally well on laboratory and field infected sand fly samples as kDNA qPCR assays. The assay can detect 10-3 parasite equivalent in sand flies and enables Leishmania quantification down to 10 parasites. We found that the copy number of SL-RNA is 3-fold lower in sand fly derived promastigotes compared to cultured promastigotes. SL-RNA detection in hyrax tissue samples appeared less efficient, which is presumably due to long-term storage without RNA stabilizing reagents. Overall, our assay is complementary to kDNA assays as it can identify viable Leishmania stages, which provides pivotal information for identification of reservoirs and vectors and their transmission capacity.","NA"

Using inducible and stable CTR9 knockdown breast cancer cell lines, we discovered that the expression of a subset of KDMs, including KDM6A and Jarid2, is strictly controlled by CTR9. Global analyses of histone modifications revealed a significant increase of H3K27me3 upon loss of CTR9. Loss of CTR9 results in a decrease of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 in gene bodies, and elevated levels and genome-wide expansion of H3K27me3. Mechanistically, CTR9 depletion triggers a PRC2 subtype switching from PRC2.2 to PRC2.1. As a consequence, CTR9 depletion generates vulnerability that renders breast cancer cells hypersensitive to PRC2 inhibitors. Our findings that CTR9 demarcates PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 levels and genomic distribution, provide a unique mechanism of transition from transcriptionally active to repressive chromatin states and sheds light on the biological functions of CTR9 in development and cancer.","NA"

Here, we use the single C. elegans ERM ortholog, ERM-1, to study the contribution of these regulatory events to ERM activity and tissue formation in vivo. Using CRISPR/Cas9-generated erm-1 mutant alleles we demonstrate that PIP2-binding is critically required for ERM-1 function. In contrast, dynamic regulation of C-terminal T544 phosphorylation is not essential but modulates ERM-1 apical localization and dynamics in a tissue-specific manner, to control cortical actin organization and drive lumen formation in epithelial tubes.

A.","Gabriel Koch Ocker","Allen Institute for Brain Science","2020-01-09",3,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","neuroscience","Neural computation is determined by neuron dynamics and circuit connectivity. Uncertain and dynamic environments may require neural hardware to adapt to different computational tasks, each requiring different connectivity configurations. At the same time, connectivity is subject to a variety of constraints, placing limits on the possible computations a given neural circuit can perform. Here we examine the hypothesis that the organization of neural circuitry favors computational flexibility: that it makes many computational solutions available, given physiological constraints. From this hypothesis, we develop models of the degree distributions of connectivity based on constraints on a neurons total synaptic weight. To test these models, we examine reconstructions of the mushroom bodies from the first instar larva and the adult Drosophila melanogaster. We perform a Bayesian model comparison for two constraint models and a random wiring null model. Overall, we find that flexibility under a homeostatically fixed total synaptic weight describes Kenyon cell connectivity better than other models, suggesting a principle shaping the apparently random structure of Kenyon cell wiring. Furthermore, we find evidence that larval Kenyon cells are more flexible earlier in development, suggesting a mechanism whereby neural circuits begin as flexible systems that develop into specialized computational circuits.

Author summaryHigh-throughput electron microscopic anatomical experiments have begun to yield detailed maps of neural circuit connectivity. Uncovering the principles that govern these circuit structures is a major challenge for systems neuroscience. Healthy neural circuits must be able to perform computational tasks while satisfying physiological constraints. Those constraints can restrict a neurons possible connectivity, and thus potentially restrict its computation. Here we examine simple models of constraints on total synaptic weights, and calculate the number of circuit configurations they allow: their computational flexibility. We propose probabilistic models of connectivity that weight the number of synaptic partners according to computational flexibility under a constraint and test them using recent wiring diagrams from a learning center, the mushroom body, in the fly brain. We compare constraints that fix or bound a neurons total connection strength to a simple random wiring null model. Of these models, the fixed total connection strength matched the overall connectivity best in mushroom bodies from both larval and adult flies. We also provide evidence suggesting that neural circuits are more flexible in early stages of development and lose this flexibility as they grow towards specialized function.","NA"

Systematic review emerged as a method to summarise and analyse the studies quantitatively and critically but it is often out-of-date due to its lengthy process.

MethodWe invited five machine learning and text-mining groups to build classifiers for identifying publications relevant to neuropathic pain (33814 training publications). We kept 1188 publications for the assessment of the performance of different classifiers. Two groups participated in the next stage: testing their algorithm on datasets labeled for psychosis (11777/2944) and datasets labeled for Vitamin D in multiple sclerosis (train/text: 2038/510).

ResultThe performances (sensitive/specificity) of the most promising classifier built for neuropathic pain are: 95%/84%. The performance for psychosis and Vitamin D in multiple sclerosis datasets are 95%/73% and 100%/45%.

ConclusionsMachine learning can significantly reduce the irrelevant publications in a systematic review, and save the scientists time and money. Classifier algorithms built for one dataset can be reapplied on another dataset in different field. We are building a machine learning service at the back of Systematic Review & Meta-analysis Facility (SyRF).","NA"

In this setup, the axes of two micromanipulators are precisely aligned and their relative position tracked in real-time, allowing us to accurately target patch-clamp recordings to neurons near an extracellular probe. We used this setup to generate a publicly-available dataset where a cortical neurons spiking activity is recorded in patch-clamp next to a dense CMOS Neuropixels probe. ""Ground-truth"" datasets of this kind are rare but valuable to the neuroscience community, as they power the development and improvement of spike-sorting and analysis algorithms, tethering them to empirical observations. In this article, we describe our approach and report exploratory and descriptive analysis on the resulting dataset. We study the detectability of patch-clamp spikes on the extracellular probe, within-unit reliability of spike features and spatiotemporal dynamics of the action potential waveform. We open discussion and collaboration on this dataset through an online repository, with a view to producing follow-up publications.

PrologueOur efforts to record from the same neuron in vivo using patch-clamp and dense extracellular probes have resulted in three outputs: a publicly-available dataset (http://bit.ly/paired_recs), a manuscript, and a code repository (http://bit.ly/paired_git). Together, these three components form the publication arising from the experiments we have performed. The role of the dataset is to be downloaded and re-used. The role of the manuscript is to describe the experimental methods through which we acquired the dataset, explain it and showcase which types of questions it can be used to address. The repository has two roles: first, promoting reproducibility and error correction. By making our analysis and figure-generation code freely-available, we wish to make our analysis procedures clear and enable the reader to reproduce our results from the raw data, alerting us to any potential mistakes. Second, the repository will form a living, dynamic and interactive component of the publication: a forum for open collaboration on this dataset. Any interested scientists can contribute to it, joining us in detailed exploration of these recordings with a view to producing follow-up publications in which they will be credited for their input.

Why did we opt to publish this way? The first reason is that the very nature of the project we here describe - recording the same neuron with patch-clamp and extracellular probes - invites an open science and open source approach. This is because the primary use of this type of ""ground truth"" validation data is to aid the development of new sorting and analysis algorithms, as well as to benchmark and improve existing ones. The second reason is that despite being conceptually very simple, this project generated a large and complex dataset that can be tackled in many ways and used to address different types of question. Some of these questions are beyond the reach of our analytical expertise; others lie even beyond the scope of our scientific imagination. By releasing the dataset and providing a repository for scientific discussion and collaboration, we aim to maximise its scientific return to the community. Instead of having each interested research group work in isolation, we hope that by encouraging collaboration and discussion between peers we can foster synergy between them that will lead to work of greater scientific value.

Although datasets like ours are exquisitely suited for such an approach, we believe this publication strategy needs to become more widely adopted in neuroscience. We were pleased to note recent publications spontaneously and independently using similar approaches1-4, in what may well be evidence of convergent thinking. Perhaps the time has come for new publication and collaboration paradigms. We will elaborate on this subject during the Epilogue. For now, let us get back to electrophysiological recordings, before we begin an experiment on scientific collaboration.","NA"

However, most GISTs develop imatinib resistance through secondary KIT mutations. The type of resistance mutation determines sensitivity to approved second-/third-line TKIs but shows high inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that target KIT independently of the mutational status are intriguing. Inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery with bortezomib is effective in GIST cells through a dual mechanism of KIT transcriptional downregulation and upregulation of the pro-apoptotic histone H2AX but clinically problematic due to the drugs adverse effects. We therefore tested second-generation inhibitors of the 20S proteasome (delanzomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib) with better pharmacologic profiles as well as compounds targeting regulators of ubiquitination (b-AP15, MLN4924) for their effectiveness and mechanism of action in GIST. All three 20S proteasome inhibitors were highly effective in vitro and in vivo, including in imatinib-resistant models. In contrast, b-AP15 and MLN4924 were only effective at high concentrations or had mostly cytostatic effects, respectively. Our results confirm 20S proteasome inhibitors as promising strategy to overcome TKI resistance in GIST, while highlighting the complexity of the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery as a therapeutic target.","10.1038/s41598-020-62088-7"

In this study we propose adaptive divergence followed by population admixture as a source of the additive genetic variance of evolutionarily important traits. We experimentally tested the hypothesis by examining a panel of ~1,000 yeast segregants produced by a hybrid of two yeast strains that experienced adaptive divergence. We measured over 400 yeast cell morphological traits and found a strong positive correlation between h2 and evolutionary importance. Because adaptive divergence followed by population admixture could happen constantly, particularly in some species such as humans, the finding reconciles the observation of abundant additive variances in evolutionarily important traits with Fishers fundamental theorem of natural selection. It also suggests natural selection may effectively promote rather than suppress additive genetic variance in species with wide geographic distribution and strong migratory capacity.","NA"

In a companion paper (Geerligs & Maris, 2020), we demonstrate that such a drastic increase is actually possible. This increase in sensitivity is only useful if, at the same time, the false alarm (FA) rate can be controlled. However, for some study types (e.g., within-participant studies), nonparametric tests do not control the FA rate (see Eklund, Nichols, & Knutsson, 2016). In the present paper, we present a family of nonparametric randomization and permutation tests of which we prove exact FA rate control. Crucially, these proofs hold for a much larger family of study types than before, and they include both within-participant studies and studies in which the explanatory variable is not under experimental control. The crucial element of this statistical innovation is the adoption of a novel but highly relevant null hypothesis: statistical independence between the biological and the explanatory variable.","NA"

To investigate how local activity harmonizes with global signals, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) while single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) perturbed occipital and parietal cortices. We estimate the rapid network reconfigurations in dynamic network communities within specific frequency bands of the EEG, and characterize two distinct features of network reconfiguration, flexibility and allegiance, among spatially distributed neural sources following TMS. Using distance from the stimulation site to infer local and global effects, we find that alpha activity (8-12Hz) reflects concurrent local and global effects on network dynamics. Pair-wise allegiance of brain regions to communities on average increased near the stimulation site, whereas TMS-induced changes to flexibility were generally invariant to distance and stimulation site. In contrast, communities within the beta (13-20Hz) band demonstrated a high level of spatial specificity, particularly within a cluster comprising paracentral areas. Together, these results suggest that focal magnetic neurostimulation to distinct cortical sites can help identify both local and global effects on brain network dynamics, and highlight fundamental differences in the manifestation of network reconfigurations within alpha and beta frequency bands.

However, when modelling a relevant phenotype as a function of high dimensional measurements, power to estimate inter-actions is low, the number of possible interactions could be enormous and their effects may be non-linear. Existing approaches for high dimensional modelling such as the lasso might keep an interaction but remove a main effect, which is problematic for interpretation. In this work, we introduce a method called sail for detecting non-linear interactions with a key environmental or exposure variable in high-dimensional settings which respects either the strong or weak heredity constraints. We prove that asymptotically, our method possesses the oracle property, i.e., it performs as well as if the true model were known in advance. We develop a computationally effcient fitting algorithm with automatic tuning parameter selection, which scales to high-dimensional datasets. Through an extensive simulation study, we show that sail out-performs existing penalized regression methods in terms of prediction accuracy and support recovery when there are non-linear interactions with an exposure variable. We then apply sail to detect non-linear interactions between genes and a prenatal psychosocial intervention program on cognitive performance in children at 4 years of age.

Intercellular signaling pathways control stem cell systems, where niche cells signal stem cells to maintain the stem cell fate/self renewal and inhibit differentiation. In the C. elegans germline, GLP-1 Notch signaling specifies the stem cell fate. We undertook a comprehensive genome-wide approach to identify transcriptional targets of GLP-1 signaling. We expected primary response target genes to be evident at the intersection of genes identified as directly bound by LAG-1, the C. elegans Notch pathway sequence-specific DNA binding protein, from ChIP-seq experiments, with genes identified as requiring GLP-1 signaling for RNA accumulation, from RNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, we performed a time-course transcriptomics analysis following auxin inducible degradation of LAG-1 to distinguish between genes whose RNA level was a primary or secondary response of GLP-1 signaling. Surprisingly, only lst-1 and sygl-1, the two known target genes of GLP-1 in the germline, fulfilled these criteria, indicating that these two genes are the primary response targets of GLP-1 Notch and may be the sole germline GLP-1 signaling protein-coding transcriptional targets for mediating the stem cell fate. In addition, three secondary response genes were identified based on their timing following loss of LAG-1, their lack of a LAG-1 ChIP-seq peak and that their glp-1 dependent mRNA accumulation could be explained by a requirement for lst-1 and sygl-1 activity. Moreover, our analysis also suggests that the function of the primary response genes lst-1 and sygl-1 can account for the glp-1 dependent peak protein accumulation of FBF-2, which promotes the stem cell fate and, in part, for the spatial restriction of elevated LAG-1 accumulation to the stem cell region.

Author SummaryStem cell systems are central to tissue development, homeostasis and regeneration, where niche to stem cell signaling pathways promote the stem cell fate/self-renewal and inhibit differentiation. The evolutionarily conserved GLP-1 Notch signaling pathway in the C. elegans germline is an experimentally tractable system, allowing dissection of control of the stem cell fate and inhibition of meiotic development. However, as in many systems, the primary molecular targets of the signaling pathway in stem cells is incompletely known, as are secondary molecular targets, and this knowledge is essential for a deep understanding of stem cell systems. Here we focus on the identification of the primary transcriptional targets of the GLP-1 signaling pathway that promotes the stem cell fate, employing unbiased multilevel genomic approaches. We identify only lst-1 and sygl-1, two of a number of previously reported targets, as likely the sole primary mRNA transcriptional targets of GLP-1 signaling that promote the germline stem cell fate. We also identify secondary GLP-1 signaling RNA and protein targets, whose expression shows dependence on lst-1 and sygl-1, where the protein targets reinforce the importance of posttranscriptional regulation in control of the stem cell fate.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1008650"

M.","Matthew Jones","Arizona State University","2020-01-09",2,"cc_no","new results","evolutionary biology","Determining how different populations adapt to similar environments is fundamental to understanding the limits of adaptation under changing environments. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) typically molt into white winter coats to remain camouflaged against snow. In some warmer climates, hares have evolved brown winter camouflage - an adaptation that may spread under climate change. We used extensive range-wide genomic data to 1) resolve broad-scale patterns of population structure and gene flow and 2) investigate the factors shaping the origins and distribution of winter-brown camouflage variation. In coastal Pacific Northwest (PNW) populations, winter-brown camouflage is known to be determined by a recessive haplotype at the Agouti pigmentation gene. Our phylogeographic analyses revealed deep structure and limited gene flow between PNW and more northern Boreal populations, where winter-brown camouflage is rare along the range edge. Genome sequencing of a winter-brown snowshoe hare from Alaska shows that it lacks the winter-brown PNW haplotype, reflecting a history of convergent phenotypic evolution. However, the PNW haplotype does occur at low frequency in a winter-white population from Montana, consistent with the spread of a locally deleterious recessive variant that is masked from selection when rare. Simulations show that if annual snow cover dramatically declined in the same population, then the predicted selective increase in frequency of the now beneficial winter-brown Agouti allele is likely to be extremely slow due to the same masking effect. Our findings underscore how allelic dominance can shape the geographic extent and rate of convergent adaptation in response to rapidly changing environments.","10.1111/evo.13976"

Previous work suggests the involvement of two motives, self-interest and regard for others. However, it remains unknown if these motives are related or independently contribute to (dis)honesty, and what are the neural instantiations of these motives. Using a modified Message Game task, in which a Sender sends a dishonest (yet profitable) or honest (less profitable) message to a Receiver, we found that these two motives contributed to dishonesty independently. Furthermore, the two motives involve distinct brain networks: the LPFC tracked potential value to self, whereas the rTPJ tracked potential losses to other, and individual differences in motives modulated these neural responses. Finally, activity in the vmPFC represented a balance of the two motives unique to each participant. Taken together, our results suggest that (dis)honest decisions incorporate at least two separate cognitive and neural processes - valuation of potential profits to self and valuation of potential harm to others.","NA"

Specifically in the hippocampus, CaMKII is required for learning and memory. CaMKII is encoded by four highly conserved genes in vertebrates: , {beta}, {gamma}, and {delta}. AllCaMKIIs are comprised of a kinase domain, regulatory segment, variable linker region, and hub domain responsible for oligomerization. The four genes differ primarily in linker length and composition due to extensive alternative splicing. Here, we unambiguously report the heterogeneity of CaMKII transcripts in 3 complex samples of human hippocampus using Illumina sequencing. Our results show that hippocampal cells contain a diverse collection of 70 CaMKII transcripts from all four CaMKII genes. We characterized the Ca2+/CaM sensitivity of hippocampal CaMKII variants spanning a broad range of linker lengths and compositions. We demonstrate that the effect of the variable linker on Ca2+/CaM sensitivity is conditional on kinase and hub domains. Moreover, we reveal a novel role for the hub domain as an allosteric regulator of kinase activity, which may provide a new pharmacological target for modulating CaMKII activity. Using small angle X-ray scattering and single-particle electron cryo-microscopy, we present evidence for extensive interaction between the kinase and the hub domain, even in the presence of a 30-residue linker. Taken together, we propose that Ca2+/CaM sensitivity in CaMKII is gene-dependent and includes significant contributions from the hub. Our sequencing approach combined with biochemistry provides new insights into understanding the complex pool of endogenous CaMKII.

One Sentence SummaryCaMKII is a well-conserved protein that is essential for learning and memory. When CaMKII is mutated in a mouse, this mouse has difficulty learning and remembering how to get through a maze. The hippocampus is the part of the brain required for memory. Here, we used a specific experiment to determine every type of CaMKII that is in a human hippocampus. We found 70 different types and then asked how these differences affect CaMKII function. These data provide evidence that an assembly domain of CaMKII plays an unexpected role regulating its activity. This new finding helps us better understand endogenous CaMKII in the brain and provides a new mechanism for modulating CaMKII activity.","NA"

We explore characteristics of their usage, impact and assured funding horizon to assess their value and importance as an infrastructure, to understand sustainability of the infrastructure, and to demonstrate a model for assessing Core Data Resources worldwide.

ResultsThe nineteen resources currently designated ELIXIR Core Data Resources form a data infrastructure in Europe which is a subset of the worldwide open life science data infrastructure. We show that, from 2014 to 2018, data managed by the Core Data Resources more than tripled while staff numbers increased by less than a tenth. Additionally, support for the Core Data Resources is precarious: together they have assured funding for less than a third of current staff after four years.

Our findings demonstrate the importance of the ELIXIR Core Data Resources as repositories for research data and knowledge, while also demonstrating the uncertain nature of the funding environment for this infrastructure. ELIXIR is working towards longer-term support for the Core Data Resources and, through the Global Biodata Coalition, aims to ensure support for the worldwide life science data resource infrastructure of which the ELIXIR Core Data Resources are a subset.

However, reprogramming fibroblasts to a liver progenitor fate, induced hepatocytes (iHeps), makes them sensitive to transformation by the same oncogenes. The transformed iHeps are highly proliferative, tumorigenic in nude mice, and bear gene expression signatures of liver cancer. These results show that tumorigenesis is triggered by a combination of three elements: the set of driver mutations, the cellular lineage, and the state of differentiation of the cells along the lineage.

Artificially increasing dinucleotide frequencies results in substantial attenuation of virus replication, suggesting that these compositional changes may facilitate recognition of non-self RNA sequences. Recently, the interferon inducible protein ZAP, was identified as the host factor responsible for sensing CpG in viral RNA, through direct binding and possibly downstream targeting for degradation. Using an arrayed interferon stimulated gene expression library screen, we identified ZAPS, and its associated factor TRIM25, as direct inhibitors of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. Exogenous expression of ZAPS and TRIM25 significantly reduced virus replication while knockdown resulted in increased virus replication. HCMV displays a strikingly heterogeneous pattern of CpG representation with a specific suppression of CpGs within the IE1 major immediate early transcript which is absent in subsequently expressed genes. We demonstrated that suppression of CpG dinucleotides in the IE1 gene allows evasion of inhibitory effects of ZAP. During HCMV infection, expression of ZAP and TRIM25 are rapidly reduced, removing pressure to suppress dinucleotide frequencies in viral genes expressed after the immediate early genes, while acute virus replication and high levels of ZAP are mutually exclusive. Finally, we show that TRIM25 regulates alternative splicing between the ZAP short and long isoforms during HCMV infection and interferon induction, with knockdown of TRIM25 resulting in decreased ZAPS and corresponding increased ZAPL expression. These results demonstrate for the first time that ZAP is a potent host restriction factor against large DNA viruses and that HCMV evades ZAP detection through suppression of CpG dinucleotides within the major immediate early transcripts. Furthermore, TRIM25 is required for efficient upregulation of the interferon inducible short isoform of ZAP through regulation of alternative splicing.","NA"

Here, we systematically explored how numbers of trials and subjects affect statistical power in MEG sensor-level data. More specifically, we simulated ""experiments"" using the MEG resting-state dataset of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We divided the data in two conditions, injected a dipolar source at a known anatomical location in the ""signal condition"", but not in the ""noise condition"", and detected significant differences at sensor level with classical paired t-tests across subjects.

The group-level detectability of these simulated effects varied drastically with their anatomical origin. We thus examined in detail which spatial properties of the sources affected detectability, looking specifically at the distance and orientation of the source with respect to the closest sensor, and at the variability of these parameters across subjects. In line with previous single-subject studies, we found that the most detectable effects originate from source positions that are closest to the sensors and oriented tangentially with respect to the sensor array. In addition, cross-subject variability in orientation also affected group-level detectability, boosting detection in regions where this variability was small and hindering detection in regions where it was large. Incidentally, we observed a considerable covariation of source position, orientation, and their cross-subject variability in individual brain anatomical space, making it difficult to assess the impact of each of these variables independently of one another. Therefore, we performed an additional set of simulations with the same simulation strategy as before, but this time, controlling spatial properties independently of individual anatomy. This allowed us to disentangle the effects of position, orientation, and cross-subject variability of these properties on detectability, confirming the strong impact of distance and orientation. Moreover, it showed that orientation variability across subjects affects detectability, whereas position variability does not.

Importantly, our study indicates that strict unequivocal recommendations as to the ideal number of trials and subjects for any experiment cannot be realistically provided for neurophysiological studies. Rather, it highlights the importance of considering the spatial constraints underlying expected sources of activity while planning experiments. This is particularly relevant for performing network level analyses in cognitive neuroscience studies, where nodes in a network cannot be considered equally detectable. Finally, we note that this variation in detectability may also partly account for the over-representation of some fields of study over others in the MEG domain (e.g. sensorimotor and auditory studies).

The DMS is comprised mostly of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that are divided into dopamine D1 receptor expressing neurons (dMSNs), and dopamine D2 receptor expressing neurons (iMSNs). Here, we examined the cell-type specificity of Fyns actions on the development of alcohol use. First, we knocked down Fyn selectively in DMS dMSNs or iMSNs of mice and measured the level of alcohol consumption. We found that downregulation of Fyn in dMSNs, but not in iMSNs, reduces excessive alcohol but not saccharin intake and preference. D1Rs are coupled to Gs/olf, which activate cAMP signaling. To examine whether Fyns actions are mediated through cAMP signaling, DMS dMSNs were infected with GsDREADD, and the activation of Fyn signaling was measured following CNO treatment. We found that remote stimulation of cAMP signaling in DMS dMSNs activates Fyn and promotes the phosphorylation of the Fyn substrate, GluN2B. Next, we tested whether remote activation of GsDREADD in DMS dMSNs or iMSNs alters alcohol intake, and observed that CNO-dependent activation of GsDREADD in DMS dMSNs but not iMSNs increases alcohol but not saccharin intake and preference. Finally, we examined the contribution of Fyn to GsDREADD-dependent increase in alcohol intake, and found that systemic administration of the Fyn inhibitor, AZD0503 blocks GsDREADD-dependent increase in alcohol consumption. Our results suggest that the cAMP-Fyn axis in the DMS dMSNs is a molecular transducer of mechanisms underlying the development of excessive alcohol consumption.","NA"

We studied 30 drug-resistant TLE patients and 57 healthy controls using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging analyses. We developed a novel framework that parameterizes functional connectivity distance, consolidating functional and geometric properties of macroscale networks. Compared to controls, TLE showed connectivity distance reductions in temporo-insular and prefrontal networks, suggesting topological segregation of functional networks. Our novel approach furthermore allowed for the testing of morphological and microstructural associations, and revealed that functional connectivity contractions occurred independently from TLE-related cortical atrophy but were mediated by microstructural changes in the underlying white matter. All patients underwent a comparable resective surgery after our study and a regularized supervised machine learning paradigm with 5-fold cross-validation demonstrated that patient-specific functional anomalies predicted post-surgical seizure outcome with 74{+/-}8% accuracy, outperforming classifiers operating on clinical and structural imaging features.

We exploit a copula-based framework to model differential coexpression between gene pair in two different conditions. The Copula is used to model the dependency between expression profiles of a gene pair. For a gene pair, the distance between two joint distributions produced by copula is served as differential coexpression. We used five pan-cancer TCGA RNA-Seq data to evaluate the model which outperforms the existing state-of-the-art. Moreover, the proposed model can detect a mild change in the coexpression pattern across two conditions.

We compared the demographic history of nine endemic species in order to explore their demographic responses to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. We found that Rapa Nui endemic species share a common demographic history as signatures of population expansions were retrieved for almost all of the species studied here, and synchronous demographic expansions initiated during the last glacial period were recovered for more than half of the studied species. These results suggest that eustatic fluctuations associated with Milankovitch cycles have played a central role in species demographic histories and in the final stage of the community assembly of many Rapa Nui reef fishes. Specifically, sea level low stands resulted in the maximum reef habitat extension for Rapa Nui endemic species; we discuss the potential role of seamounts in allowing endemic species to cope with Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, and we highlight the importance of local historical processes over regional ones. Overall, our results shed light on the mechanisms by which endemism arises and is maintained in peripheral reef fish fauna.","NA"

This report demonstrates the value of prospectively collected genomic data for verifying CIDT targets.

We utilised the genomes of 3165 Salmonella isolates prospectively collected and sequenced in Australia. The sequence of Salmonella CIDT PCR gene targets (ttrA, spaO and invA) were systematically interrogated to measure nucleotide dissimilarity. Analysis of 52 different serovars and 79 MLST types demonstrated dissimilarity within and between PCR gene targets ranging between 0 - 81.3 SNP/Kbp (0 and 141 SNPs). Lowest average dissimilarity was observed in the ttrA target gene used by the Roche LightMix at 2.0 SNP/Kbp [range 0 - 46.7]), however entropy across the gene demonstrates it may not be the most stable CIDT target.

While debate continues over the benefits and pitfalls of replacing bacterial culture with molecular assays, the growing volumes of genomic surveillance data enable periodic regional reassessment and validation of CIDT targets against both prevalent and emerging serovars. If PCR systems are to become the primary screening and diagnostic tool for laboratory diagnosis of salmonellosis, ongoing monitoring of the genomic diversity in PCR target regions is warranted as is the potential inclusion of two Salmonella PCR targets into frontline diagnostic systems.","NA"

A unifying model of cognitive maps will need to explain how the maps can be learned scalably with sensory observations that are non-unique over multiple spatial locations (aliased), retrieved efficiently in the face of uncertainty, and form the fabric of efficient hierarchical planning. We propose learning higher-order graphs - structured in a specific way that allows efficient learning, hierarchy formation, and inference - as the general principle that connects these different desiderata. We show that these graphs can be learned efficiently from experienced sequences using a cloned Hidden Markov Model (CHMM), and uncertainty-aware planning can be achieved using message-passing inference. Using diverse experimental settings, we show that CHMMs can be used to explain the emergence of context-specific representations, formation of transferable structural knowledge, transitive inference, shortcut finding in novel spaces, remapping of place cells, and hierarchical planning. Structured higher-order graph learning and probabilistic inference might provide a simple unifying framework for understanding hippocampal function, and a pathway for relational abstractions in artificial intelligence.","NA"

In young animals, such sequences may be poorly coordinated, but with age and experience, behaviour progressively adapts to efficiently exploit the animals ecological niche. How experience impinges on the developing neural circuits of behaviour is an open question. As a model system, larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) hold enormous potential for studying both the development of behaviour and the underlying circuits, but no relevant experience-dependent learning paradigm has yet been characterized. To address this, we have conducted a detailed study of the effects of experience on the ontogeny of hunting behaviour in larval zebrafish. We report that larvae with prior prey experience consume considerably more prey than naive larvae. This is mainly due to increased capture success that is also accompanied by a modest increase in hunt rate. We identified two components of the hunting sequence that are jointly modified by experience. At the onset of the hunting sequence, the orientation strategy of the turn towards prey is modified such that experienced larvae undershoot prey azimuth. Near the end of the hunt sequence, we find that experienced larvae are more likely to employ high-speed capture swims initiated from longer distances to prey. Combined, these modified turn and capture manoeuvrers can be used to predict the probability of capture success and suggest that their development provides advantages specific to larvae feeding on live-prey. Our findings establish an ethologically relevant paradigm in zebrafish for studying how the brain is shaped by experience to drive the ontogeny of efficient behaviour.","NA"

However, hybridization in Amazonias megadiverse tree flora was assumed to be extremely rare despite extensive sympatry between closely related species, and its role in diversification remains enigmatic because it has not yet been examined empirically. Using members of a dominant Amazonian tree family (Brownea, Fabaceae) as a model to address this knowledge gap, our study recovered extensive evidence of hybridization among multiple lineages across phylogenetic scales. More specifically, our results uncovered several historical introgression events between Brownea lineages and indicated that gene tree incongruence in Brownea is best explained by introgression, rather than solely by incomplete lineage sorting. Furthermore, investigation of recent hybridization using [~]19,000 ddRAD loci recovered a high degree of shared variation between two Brownea species which co-occur in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Our analyses also showed that these sympatric lineages exhibit homogeneous rates of introgression among loci relative to the genome-wide average, implying a lack of selection against hybrid genotypes and a persistence of hybridization over time. Our results demonstrate that gene flow between multiple Amazonian tree species has occurred across temporal scales, and contrasts with the prevailing view of hybridizations rarity in Amazonia. Overall, our results provide novel evidence that reticulate evolution influenced diversification in part of the Amazonian tree flora, which is the most diverse on Earth.","NA"

Here, we use a laboratory experiment over 6 generations to measure the ability of wild-caught medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) to evolve in response to bidirectional size-dependent selection mimicking opposite harvest regimes. Specifically, we imposed selection against a small body size (Large line), against a large body size (Small line) or random selection (Control line), and measured correlated responses across multiple phenotypic, life-history and endocrine traits. As expected, the Large line evolved faster somatic growth and delayed maturation, but also evolved smaller body sizes at hatch, with no change in average levels of pituitary gene expressions of luteinizing, follicle-stimulating or growth (GH) hormones. In contrast, the Small medaka line was unable to evolve smaller body sizes or earlier maturation, but showed marginally-significant signs of increased reproductive investment (age effect on maturity probability, larger egg sizes, elevated pituitary GH production). Natural selection on medaka body size was too weak to significantly hinder the effect of artificial selection, indicating that the asymmetric body-size response to size-dependent selection reflected an asymmetry in body-size evolvability. Our results show that trait evolvability may be contingent upon the direction of selection, and that a detailed knowledge of trait evolutionary potential is needed to forecast population response to anthropogenic change.","NA"

Despite recent major advances in the understanding of complex food web dynamics, food web models have so far generally ignored nutrient cycling. However, nutrient cycling is expected to strongly impact food web stability and functioning. To make up for this gap, we built an allometric and size structured food web model including nutrient cycling. By releasing mineral nutrients, recycling increases the availability of limiting resources for primary producers and links each trophic level to the bottom of food webs. We found that nutrient cycling can provide a significant part of the total nutrient supply of the food web, leading to a strong enrichment effect that promotes species persistence in nutrient poor ecosystems but leads to a paradox of enrichment at high nutrient inputs. The presence of recycling loops linking each trophic level to the basal resources weakly affects species biomass temporal variability in the food web. Recycling loops tend to slightly dampen the destabilising effect of nutrient enrichment on consumer temporal variability while they have opposite effects for primary producers. By considering nutrient cycling, this new model improves our understanding of the response of food webs to nutrient availability and opens perspectives to better link studies on food web dynamics and ecosystem functioning.","NA"

In this work was studied the cell death, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) - phytohormone imbalance interplay underlying the phytotoxicity of fumonisin B1 (FB1) in maize germplasms with contrasting resistance to Fusarium ear rot in the field.

MethodsResistant (RH) and susceptible hybrid (SH) maize seedlings, grown from uninoculated seeds irrigated with FB1 (1 and 20 ppm), were harvested at 7, 14 and 21 days after planting, and were examined for electrolyte leakage (aerial parts); and for oxidative stress biomarkers (aerial parts and roots). The phytohormone (salicylic and jasmonic acids) imbalance interplay underlying the FB1-induced cell death were further explored in seedlings exposed 24 h to the mycotoxin (1 ppm) in hydroponics.

ResultsCell death increased in RH and SH watered with 1 and 20 ppm of mycotoxin, respectively. Both toxin concentrations were pro-oxidant, and the major perturbations were found in roots. An Integrated Biomarker Response index was calculated suggesting that phytotoxicity occurs in a redox context more efficiently controlled by RH.

ConclusionThe pre-treatment with the antioxidant ascorbic acid led to the conclusion that cell death in RH was related to a salicylic acid increase mediated by ROS. Nevertheless, FB1 induced two different phytohormonal regulatory mechanisms mediated by oxidative stress in both maize hybrids.","NA"

For each model simulator, we constructed four models, starting from a simplified model and stepwise including more model complexity. For the resulting eight models, the predictions of the impact of behavioural interventions on the HIV epidemic in Yaounde (Cameroon) were compared. The results show that differences in model assumptions and model complexity can influence the size of the predicted impact of the intervention, as well as the predicted qualitative behaviour of the HIV epidemic after the intervention. Moreover, two models that agree in their predictions of the HIV epidemic in absence of an intervention can have different outputs when predicting the impact of interventions. These findings highlight the importance of making more data available for the calibration and validation of epidemiological models.","NA"

It forms the basis of a valuable commercial fishery and its ubiquity means that it plays a key role in coastal ecosystems and food webs. Like other filter feeding bivalves it can accumulate potent phytotoxins, to which it has evolved some immunity. The molecular origins of this immunity are of interest to evolutionary biologists, pharmaceutical companies and fisheries management.

FindingsHere we report the genome sequencing of this species, conducted as part of the Wellcome Sanger 25 Genomes Project. This genome was assembled from PacBio reads and scaffolded with 10x Chromium and Hi-C data, and its 3,983 scaffolds have an N50 of 44.8 Mb (longest scaffold 60.1 Mb), with 92% of the assembly sequence contained in 19 scaffolds, corresponding to the 19 chromosomes found in this species. The total assembly spans 918.3 Mb, and is the best-scaffolded marine bivalve genome published to date, exhibiting 95.5% recovery of the metazoan BUSCO set. Gene annotation resulted in 67,741 gene models. Analysis of gene content revealed large numbers of gene duplicates, as previously seen in bivalves, with little gene loss, in comparison with the sequenced genomes of other marine bivalve species.

ConclusionsThe genome assembly of Pecten maximus and its annotated gene set provide a high-quality platform for a wide range of investigations, including studies on such disparate topics as shell biomineralization, pigmentation, vision and resistance to algal toxins. As a result of our findings we highlight the sodium channel gene Nav1, known as a gene conferring resistance to saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin, as a candidate for further studies investigating immunity to domoic acid.","NA"

Although inflammatory responses apparently precede striatal damage and an overall progression of HD, the molecular mechanisms at work remain unclear (1-6). In this study, we found that cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a DNA sensor, which regulates inflammation, autophagy, and cellular senescence (7-9), plays a critical role in the inflammatory responses of HD. Ribosome profiling analysis reveals that cGAS mRNA has a high ribosome occupancy at exon 1 and codon-specific pauses at positions 171 (CCG) and 172 (CGT) in HD cells, compared to the control, indicating an altered cGAS expression. Accordingly, cGAS protein levels and activity, as measured by phosphorylation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) or TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), are increased in HD striatal cells, mouse Q175HD striatum and human postmortem HD striatum, compared to the healthy control. Furthermore, cGAS-dependent inflammatory genes such as Cxcl10 and Ccl5 show enhanced ribosome occupancy at exon 3 and exon 1, respectively and are upregulated in HD cells. Depletion of cGAS via CRISPR/Cas-9 diminishes cGAS activity and decreases expression of inflammatory genes while suppressing the autophagy upregulation in HD cells. We additionally detected the presence of numerous micronuclei, a known inducer of cGAS, in the cytoplasm of HD cells. Overall, the data indicates that cGAS is highly upregulated in HD and mediates inflammatory and autophagy responses. Thus, targeting cGAS may offer therapeutic benefits in HD.","NA"

M.","Federico Agostini","The Francis Crick Institute","2020-01-09",1,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","genomics","BackgroundEukaryotic genomes undergo pervasive transcription, leading to the production of many types of stable and unstable RNAs. Transcription is not restricted to regions with annotated gene features but includes almost any genomic context. Currently, the source and function of most RNAs originating from intergenic regions in the human genome remains unclear.

ResultsWe hypothesised that many intergenic RNA can be ascribed to the presence of as-yet unannotated genes or the  fuzzy transcription of known genes that extends beyond the annotated boundaries. To elucidate the contributions of these two sources, we assembled a dataset of >2.5 billion publicly available RNA-seq reads across 5 human cell lines and multiple cellular compartments to annotate transcriptional units in the human genome. About 80% of transcripts from unannotated intergenic regions can be attributed to the fuzzy transcription of existing genes; the remaining transcripts originate mainly from putative long non-coding RNA loci that are rarely spliced. We validated the transcriptional activity of these intergenic RNA using independent measurements, including transcriptional start sites, chromatin signatures, and genomic occupancies of RNA polymerase II in various phosphorylation states. We also analysed the nuclear localisation and sensitivities of intergenic transcripts to nucleases to illustrate that they tend to be rapidly degraded either  on-chromatin by XRN2 or  off-chromatin by the exosome.

ConclusionsWe provide a curated atlas of intergenic RNAs that distinguishes between alternative processing of well annotated genes from independent transcriptional units based on the combined analysis of chromatin signatures, nuclear RNA localisation and degradation pathways.","NA"

So far, no telomere-to-telomere assembly of entire MAC genome in ciliate species is finished. Development of the third generation sequencing technologies allows to generate sequencing reads up to megabases in length that could possibly span an entire MAC chromosome. Taking advantage of ultra-long Nanopore reads, we established a simple strategy for the complete assembly of ciliate MAC genomes. Using this strategy, we assembled the complete MAC genomes of two ciliate species Tetrahymena thermophila and Tetrahymena shanghaiensis, composed of 181 and 214 chromosomes telomere-to-telomere respectively.

Gene expression fluctuates according to environmental and endogenous events and therefore is likely to reveal changes during a migraine attack. We examined the hypothesis that changes in RNA expression during and outside of a spontaneous migraine attack exist which are specific to the migraine attack.

MethodsWe collected blood samples from 27 migraine patients during an attack, two hours after treatment with subcutaneous sumatriptan, on a headache-free day and after a cold pressor test. All patients were deeply phenotyped, including headache characteristics and treatment effect during the sampling. RNA-Sequencing, genotyping, and steroid profiling was performed on all samples. RNA-Sequences were analyzed at gene level (differential expression analysis) and at network level, and we integrated transcriptomic and genomic data.

ResultsWe found 29 differentially expressed (DE) genes between  attack and  after treatment, after subtracting non-migraine specific genes, i.e. genes related to a general pain/stress response. DE genes were functioning in fatty acid oxidation, signaling pathways and immune-related pathways. Network analysis revealed molecular mechanisms affected by change in gene interactions during the migraine attack, e.g.  ion transmembrane transport and  response to stress. Integration of genomic and transcriptomic data revealed pathways related to sumatriptan treatment, i.e.  5HT1 type receptor mediated signaling pathway.

InterpretationUsing a paired-sample design, we uniquely investigated intra-individual changes in the gene expression during a migraine attack. We revealed both genes and pathway potentially involved in the pathophysiology of migraine.","NA"

Yet, high-level emotional and semantic contextual factors likely guide the perception and evaluation of roughness features in vocal sounds. Here we examined the relationship between perceived vocal arousal and auditory context. We presented listeners with nonverbal vocalizations (yells of a single vowel) at varying levels of portrayed vocal arousal, in two musical contexts (clean guitar, distorted guitar) and one non-musical context (modulated noise). As predicted, vocalizations with higher levels of portrayed vocal arousal were judged as more negative and more emotionally aroused than the same voices produced with low vocal arousal. Moreover, both the perceived valence and emotional arousal of vocalizations were significantly affected by both musical and non-musical contexts. These results show the importance of auditory context in judging emotional arousal and valence in voices and music, and suggest that nonlinear features in music are processed similarly to communicative vocal signals.","10.1016/j.beproc.2020.104042"

As the problem of combinatorial explosions between ncRNA and disease exposes out gradually, new bioinformatics methods for large-scale identification and prioritization of potential associations are therefore of interest. However, in the real world, the network of interactions between molecules is enormously intricate and noisy, which poses a problem for efficient graph mining. This study aims to make preliminary attempts on bionetwork based graph mining.

ResultsIn this study, we present a method based on graph attention network to identify potential and biologically significant piRNA-disease associations (PDAs), called GAPDA. The attention mechanism can calculate a hidden representation of an association in the network based on neighbor nodes and assign weights to the input to make decisions. In particular, we introduced the attention-based Graph Neural Networks to the field of bio-association prediction for the first time, and proposed an abstract network topology suitable for small samples. Specifically, we combined piRNA sequence information and disease semantic similarity with piRNA-disease association network to construct a new attribute network. In the experiment, GAPDA performed excellently in five-fold cross-validation with the AUC of 0.9038. Not only that, but it still has superior performance compared to methods based on collaborative filtering and attribute features. The experimental results show that GAPDA ensures the prospect of the graph neural network on such problems and can be an excellent supplement for future biomedical research.

In order to further improve the toxic sensitivity of yeast cells biosensor, the effect of the action time, the initial pH value of the medium and the temperature on inhibiting cell growth were investigated. Response surface regression analysis was conducted to obtain optimal culture conditions. Th effects of treated yeast morphology, ROS, DNA, caspase 3 activity were analyzed. This optimized yeast as a biosensor was used to detect chlorothalonil and heavy metals. The results are as follows: at optimal culture conditions, EC50 values of chlorothalonil to yeast biosensor determined at incubation time 4 h increased from 0.25 {micro}g{middle dot}mL-1 in the control to 0.006 {micro}g{middle dot}mL-1, which increased by 41.67 times. Compared with the control yeast cells, the morphology of optimized yeast cells were more transparent, with significantly increased intracellular vesicle rate and cell membrane permeability, intracelluar ROS increased siginificantly, DNA bands extracted was ladder, and caspase 3 activity was stimulated. The yeast biosensor had a high sensitivity to heavy metals. After analysis, many treated cells were apoptosis which was the main reason for the increasing sensitivity to detect harmful substances. It was found that the method provides a new idea for the detection of harmful substances in the environment.

Yeast cells biosensor could be used to detect harmful substances in the environment, sunch as chlorothalonil, heavy metals. Even through chemical analysis methods, such as ICP-MS and High Performance Liquid Choromatography (HPLC), have strengths in accuracy and limit of detection, it is impossible to evaluate the cytotoxicity and the biological effect of waste water by chemical result alone, and it is also expensive, prolix and complicated. However, the yeast cell biosensor is easy to operate, is sensitive to various toxicants, comparable to the other totxicity detection methods, is cheap in cost, and has. Therefore, the method which used yeast cells as biosensor will have great potential in the detection of the cytotoxicity of waste water in the future.","NA"

We found that exposure of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs leads to alterations in arginine and polyamine metabolites due to a reduction in the levels and activity of a rate-limiting polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). The reduction in ODC was mediated by its negative regulator, antizyme, targeting ODC to the proteasome for degradation. Treatment with the ODC inhibitor DFMO sensitized TNBC cells to chemotherapy, but this was not observed in receptor-positive breast cancer cells. Moreover, TNBC cell lines showed greater sensitivity to single-agent DFMO, and ODC levels were elevated in TNBC patient samples.

In this paper we study the case of Otoch Maax Yetel Kooh, an NPA in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, that has been studied in a multidisciplinary way for more than twenty years. This reserve and its buffer zone is homeland to Yucatec Mayan communities that until recently used to manage their resources following a multiple use strategy (MUS), which involves local agricultural practices and has been proposed as resilience-enhancing mechanism. However, due to the restrictions imposed by the decree of the reserve and the growth of tourism in the region, some of these communities have started to abandon the MUS and specialize on tourism-related activities. We build a dynamical computational model to explore the effects of some of these changes on the capacity of this NPA to conserve the biodiversity and on the resilience of households to some frequent disturbances in the region. The model, through the incorporation of agent-based and boolean network modelling, explores the interaction between the forest, the monkey population and some productive activities done by the households (milpa agriculture, ecotourism, agriculture, charcoal production). We calibrated the model, explored its sensibility, compared it with empirical data and simulated different management scenarios. Our results suggest that those management strategies that do not exclude traditional activities may be compatible with conservation objectives, supporting previous studies. Also, our results support the hypothesis that the MUS, throughout a balanced integration of traditional and alternative activities, is a mechanism to enhance household resilience in terms of income and food availability, as it reduces variability and increases the resistance to some disturbances. Our study, in addition to highlighting the importance of local management practices for resilience, also illustrates how computational modeling and systems perspective are effective means of integrating and synthesizing information from different sources.","NA"

To do so, we used a recent statistical approach to reliably estimate demographic parameters for plant populations with a seed bank using time series of presence-absence data, which we extended to account for interspecies variation in the effects of management practices on demographic parameters. Our main finding was independent of the nature of farming practices and the demographic process. High disturbance through tillage increased survival in the seed bank of species with high seed mass. The application of herbicides, considered as an intermediate disturbance, increased germination, survival and colonization probabilities of species with high seed mass. Mowing, representing habitats more competitive for light, increased the survival of species with high seed mass.

On the population-level this results in associations between specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and polymorphic loci of the virus. Furthermore, some HLA alleles that were previously associated with slow progression to AIDS have been shown to lose their protective effect, because HLA-specific immunological escape variants have spread through the population. This phenomenon is known as immunological pre-adaptation. Apart from adapting to human immune responses, the set-point virus load (SPVL) of HIV-1 is thought to have evolved to values that optimize the population-level fitness of the virus. This suggestion is supported by considerable heritability of the SPVL. Previous modeling studies show that whether or not SPVL optimization is expected to occur depends sensitively on the underlying assumptions with respect to the extent of within-versus between-host selection. Here we use a detailed and semi-realistic multi-level HIV-1 model in which immunological pre-adaptation and SPVL evolution can emerge from the underlying interactions of the virus with the immune system of the host. This enables us to study the effect of immunological escape on disease progression, and how disease progression may be molded by SPVL evolution. We find that the time to AIDS could decrease significantly (0.5-1.0 years) in a HLA-dependent manner by immunological pre-adaptation over the long-term course of the epidemic (> 100 years). We find that SPVL is not expected to evolve to optimize the population-level fitness of HIV-1, even though high heritability of the SPVL emerges from continual selection of immune-escape mutations.","NA"

Here, we used comprehensive genetic analysis of Kocuria rhizophila to identify the bacterial genetic pathways that inhibit C. elegans translational toxin surveillance and defense. Kocuria rhizophila mutations that disrupt its ability to disable animal immunity and defense map to multiple steps in the biosynthesis of a 50-carbon bacterial carotenoid from 5 carbon precursors. Extracts of the C50 carotenoid from wild type K. rhizophila could restore this bacterial anti-immunity activity to K. rhizophila carotenoid biosynthetic mutant. Corynebacterium glutamicum, also inhibits the C. elegans translation detoxification response by producing the C50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin, and C. glutamicum carotenoid mutants are defective in this suppression of C. elegans detoxification. Consistent with the salience of these bacterial countermeasures to animal drug responses, bacterial carotenoids sensitize C. elegans to drugs that target translation and inhibit food aversion behaviors normally induced by protein translation toxins or mutations. The surveillance and response to toxins is mediated by signaling pathways conserved across animal phylogeny, suggesting that these bacterial carotenoids may also suppress such human immune and toxin responses.","NA"

Phylogenomic analyses based on 497 single copy genes confirmed the sister relationship between K. uniflora and Circaeaster agrestis, which were estimated to have diverged around 52 Mya. Proliferation of LTR retrotransposons in K. uniflora is estimated to occur around 2.7 Mya, coinciding with one recent uplift of the Hengduan Mountains between the late Miocene and late Pliocene. Across 12 species of monocots, early-diverging eudicots and core eudicots, K. uniflora showed significant overrepresentation in gene families associated with DNA repair and underrepresentation in gene families associated with stress response. Most of the plastid ndh genes were found to be lost not only in the plastome but also in the nuclear genome of K. uniflora. During the evolutionary process, the overrepresentation of gene families involved in DNA repair could help asexual K. uniflora reduce the accumulation of deleterious mutations, while at the same time, reducing genetic diversity which is important in responding to environment fluctuations. The underrepresentation of gene families related to stress response and functional loss of ndh genes could be due to lack or loss of ability to respond to environmental changes caused by long-term adaptation to a relatively stable ecological environment.","NA"

Ensifer adhaerens HP1 can utilize 3HP as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy to grow. However, the genes responsible for the degradation of 3HP remain unknown. In this study, we predicted that a gene cluster, designated 3hpd, may be responsible for the degradation of 3HP. The initial hydroxylation of 3HP is catalyzed by a four-component dehydrogenase (HpdA1A2A3A4), leading to the formation of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine (2,5-DHP) in E. adhaerens HP1. In addition, the SRPBCC component in HpdA existed as a separate subunit, which is different from other SRPBCC-containing molybdohydroxylases acting on N-heterocyclic aromatic compounds. Our findings provide a better understanding of the microbial degradation of pyridine derivatives in nature. Additionally, research on the origin of the discovered four-component dehydrogenase with a separate SRPBCC domain may be of great significance.

Importance3-Hydroxypyridine is an important building block for synthesizing drugs, herbicides and antibiotics. Although the microbial degradation of 3-hydroxypyridine has been studied for many years, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that 3hpd is responsible for the catabolism of 3-hydroxypyridine. The 3hpd gene cluster was found to be widespread in Actinobacteria, Rubrobacteria, Thermoleophilia, and Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, and the genetic organization of the 3hpd gene clusters in these bacteria showed high diversity.

Primary ciliary defects cause a group of developmental conditions known as ciliopathies, but the precise mechanisms of signal regulation by the cilium remain unclear. Previous studies have implicated the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in regulation of Wnt signalling at the ciliary basal body. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into ciliary ubiquitin processing in cells and for a ciliopathy mouse model lacking the ciliary protein Mks1. In vivo loss of Mks1 sensitizes cells to proteasomal disruption, leading to abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. To substantiate a direct link between MKS1 and the UPS, we identified UBE2E1, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that polyubiquitinates {beta}-catenin, and RNF34, an E3 ligase, as novel interactants of MKS1. UBE2E1 and MKS1 colocalized, particularly during conditions of ciliary resorption, and loss of UBE2E1 recapitulates the ciliary and Wnt signalling phenotypes observed during loss of MKS1. Levels of UBE2E1 and MKS1 are co-dependent and UBE2E1 mediates both regulatory and degradative ubiquitination of MKS1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that processing of phosphorylated {beta}-catenin occurs at the ciliary base through the functional interaction between UBE2E1 and MKS1. These observations suggest that correct {beta}-catenin levels are tightly regulated at the primary cilium by a ciliary-specific E2 (UBE2E1) and a regulatory substrate-adaptor (MKS1), confirming the fundamental role of UPS defects in the molecular pathogenesis of ciliopathies.","NA"

However, the PCI has not been assessed for reliability between sessions nor is there a clear best stimulation target to acquire a PCI.

Objective/HypothesisWe assessed the reliability of within-subject PCIs between 3 sessions with stimulation over the same premotor, motor, and parietal targets between visits, hypothesizing that we could determine a most reliable TMS-EEG target to acquire PCIs in healthy, conscious adults.

MethodsPCIs were acquired for 9 participants (5 women) over 3 sessions within a week. A 64 channel EEG system was used with all electrode impedances [&le;] 10k{Omega}. Premotor, motor, and parietal stimulation targets were identified using a real-time Matlab graphical user interface (GUI). Neuronavigation using an MRI-template brain ensured that every TMS pulse was delivered within 3.0mm and 5{degrees} of the stimulation target.

ResultsPremotor, motor, and parietal PCIs all had significant PCIs (all p < 0.05). However, parietal and motor PCIs had excellent reliability (ICCs = 0.927 and 0.857 respectively) whereas premotor PCIs had good reliability (ICC = 0.737). PCIs were similar between brain sites within each subject in a single visit, but with only a moderate effect (p = 0.024, ICC = 0.480). PCIs on a group level did not differ between brain sites (p = 0.589).

ConclusionsThe PCI is a reliable measure over this timeframe within each subject for single brain targets. PCIs for parietal and motor sites are most similar between visits. Due to only moderate similarity between PCIs from three brain sites within each session, PCIs should be acquired over at least two brain sites, with parietal and motor regions as the top candidates.","NA"

Recently, a similar neural mechanism has been reported also in value-based decision, where it allows optimal encoding of vast ranges of values in PFC: neuronal response to value depends on the choice context (relative coding), rather than being invariant across contexts (absolute coding). Additionally, value learning is sensitive to the amount of feedback information: providing complete feedback (both obtained and forgone outcomes) instead of partial feedback (only obtained outcome) improves learning. However, it is unclear whether relative coding occurs in all PFC regions and how it is affected by feedback information. We systematically investigated univariate and multivariate feedback encoding in various PFC regions and compared three modes of neural coding: absolute, partially-adaptive and fully-adaptive.

Twenty-eight human participants (both sexes) performed a learning task while undergoing fMRI scanning. On each trial, they chose between two symbols associated with a certain outcome. Then, the decision outcome was revealed. Notably, in half of the trials participants received partial feedback, while in the other half they got complete feedback. We used univariate and multivariate analysis to explore value encoding in different feedback conditions.

We found that both obtained and forgone outcomes were encoded in mPFC, but with opposite sign in ventral and dorsal subdivisions. Moreover, we showed that increasing feedback information induced a switch from absolute to relative coding. Our results suggest that complete feedback information promotes context-dependent outcome encoding.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis study offers a systematic investigation of the effect of the amount of feedback information (partial vs. complete) on univariate and multivariate outcome value encoding, within multiple regions in mPFC/ACC critical for value-based decisions and behavioural adaptation. Moreover, we provide the first comparison of three possible models of neural coding (i.e., absolute, partially-adaptive, and fully-adaptive coding) of value signal in mPFC by using commensurable measures of model accuracy. Taken together, our results help build a more comprehensive picture of how the human brain encodes and processes outcome value. In particular, our results suggest that simultaneous presentation of obtained and foregone outcomes promotes relative value representation.","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1712-19.2020"

Here, using two-photon glutamate uncaging to induce plasticity in hippocampal CA1 neurons from mice and rats, we demonstrate that p38 MAPK is required downstream of conformational NMDAR signaling to drive both spine shrinkage and LTD at individual dendritic spines. In a series of pharmacological and molecular genetic experiments, we identify key components of the non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling pathway driving dendritic spine shrinkage, including the interaction between NOS1AP and nNOS, nNOS enzymatic activity, activation of MK2 and cofilin, and signaling through CaMKII.

The Hcy pathway controls bioavailability of methyl and its homeostasis can be modulated by vitamin B12, cofactor of the methionine synthase enzyme. Herein, the neuroprotective potential and the underlying mode of action of vitamin B12 adjuvant therapy were assessed in an infant rat model of BM.

MethodsEleven-day old rats were intracysternally infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3, or saline, treated with B12 or placebo, and, 24h after infection, their hippocampi were analyzed for apoptosis in the dentate gyrus, sulfur amino acids content, global DNA methylation, transcription and proximal promoter methylation of candidate genes. Differences between groups were compared using 2-way ANOVA 2-way followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. Correlations were tested with Spearmans test.

ResultsB12 attenuated BM-induced hippocampal apoptosis in a Hcy dependent manner (r = 0.80, P < 0.05). BM caused global DNA hypomethylation, however B12 restored this parameter. Accordingly, B12 increased the methylation capacity of hippocampal cells from infected animals, as inferred from the ratio S-adenosyl methionine (SAM):S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) in infected animals. BM upregulated selected pro-inflammatory genes, and this effect was counteracted by B12, which also increased methylation of CpGs at the promoter of Ccl3 of infected animals.

ConclusionHcy is likely to play a central role in hippocampal damage in the infant rat model of BM, and B12 shows an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective action through methyl-dependent epigenetic mechanisms.","10.1186/s12974-020-01763-y"

We simultaneously recorded multisite neuronal activity from the dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex of macaque monkeys during a task and applied a state-space approach. As a result, we found that movement generation is characterized by neuronal dynamics that evolve between subspaces. When the movement is halted, this evolution is arrested and inverted. Conversely, when the Ignore signal is presented, inversion of the evolution is observed briefly and only when a specific behavioral strategy is adopted. Moreover, neuronal signatures during the inhibitory process were predictive of how PMd processes inhibitory signals, allowing the classification of the resulting behavioral strategy. Our data corroborate the PMd as a critical node in movement inhibition.","NA"

To decipher the mechanisms by which sucrose induces stem branching, we investigated the nature of the inducing molecule and the involvement of vacuolar invertase (VInv) and the plant hormone cytokinin (CK) in this process. Sucrose was more efficient at enhancing lateral bud burst and elongation than either of its hexose moieties (glucose and fructose), or a slowly metabolizable analog of sucrose (palatinose). Sucrose feeding induced expression of the sucrose transporter gene SUT2, followed by enhanced expression and activity of VInv in the lateral bud prior to its burst. We observed a reduction in the number of branches on stems of VInv-RNA interference lines during sucrose feeding, suggesting that sucrose breakdown is needed for lateral bud burst. Sucrose feeding led to increased CK content in the lateral bud base prior to bud burst. Inhibition of CK synthesis or perception inhibited the sucrose-induced bud burst, suggesting that sucrose induces stem branching through CK. Together, our results indicate that sucrose is transported to the bud, where it promotes bud burst by inducing CK accumulation and VInv activity.","NA"

METHODSDay 1: Subjects were trained on TC. Day 2: after Threat-memory reactivation, one group performed a high demanding working memory task (HWM) and the other a low demanding working memory task (LWM). The last group, only performed the HWM task. Day 3: TC memory was tested by an extinction session followed by reinstatement. Finally, all subjects completed tasks targeting stimuli representation, valuation and attentional bias towards threat.

RESULTSDisrupting reconsolidation of TC memory with a HWM weakened the implicit memory retention and faded the representation and valuation towards threat but it had no effect on attentional bias. Moreover, we revealed that subjects performance during the working memory task was specifically associated in TC memory retention.

CONCLUSIONSOur findings reveal a strong impairment of the threat-memory restabilization and associated emotional biases.

The current study examined the impact of an acute stressor on the Reward Positivity (RewP), an ERP that indexes reward sensitivity, in twenty-seven college students. Participants completed a monetary reward task while they placed their left hand in cold water set at 13 degrees Celsius (i.e., acute stress condition) and again while their hand was placed in room temperature water (i.e., control condition). These conditions were separated by one week and performed in a counter-balanced order across participants. The results revealed that the RewP amplitude was blunted in the acute stress condition compared to the control condition. Moreover, there was a trend toward this effect interacting with self-reported depressive symptoms: the RewP was only reduced among individuals who reported low depressive symptoms. The current study suggests that an acute stressor reduces the RewP, and that this effect might be moderated by current depressive symptoms. Future studies might examine the temporal association between reward processing and stress --and how they interact to predict depressive symptoms.","NA"

Bone collagen {delta}15N is also highly variable throughout this period. However some mastodons exhibit low {delta}15N values during the Blling-Allerd.

In the active state, when S839 was dephosphorylated and S870 was phosphorylated, NURK1 was found to interact with NRT2.1 at dephosphorylated S28. Upon that interaction, NURK1 can phosphorylate NRT2.1 at S21. Phosphorylation of NRT2.1 at S21 resulted in low interaction of NRT2.1 with its activator protein NAR2.1. By contrast, phosphorylation of NRT2.1 at S28 by a yet unknown kinase enhanced the interaction with NAR2.1, but inhibited the interaction with NURK1. We propose that serines S21 and S28 are involved in a phospho-switch mechanism and by which the interaction of NRT2.1 with its activator NAR2.1, and thus NRT2.1 activity, is modulated.

Here, we report the 3D structure and molecular level interactions of a chitin-binding domain (CBD-{gamma}) located in a CBP from the beak of the jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas.

We used solution state NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the molecular interactions between CBD-{gamma} and the soluble chitin derivative pentaacetyl-chitopentaose (PCP) and find that folding of this domain is triggered upon its interaction with PCP. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental 3D structure of a CBP containing the R&R consensus motif, which can be used as a template to understand in more details the role of the R&R motif found in a wide range of CBP-chitin complexes.

Haplotype assembly is a method for reconstructing haplotypes from DNA sequencing reads. By the advent of new sequencing technologies, new algorithms are needed to ensure long and accurate haplotypes. While a few linked-read haplotype assembly algorithms are available for diploid genomes, there are no algorithms yet for polyploids.

ResultsThe first haplotyping algorithm designed for 10X linked reads generated from a polyploid genome is presented, built on a typical short-read haplotyping method, SDhaP. Using the input aligned reads and called variants, the haplotype-relevant information is extracted. Next, reads with the same barcodes are combined to produce molecule-specific fragments. Then, these fragments are clustered into strongly connected components which are then used as input of a haplotype assembly core in order to estimate accurate and long haplotypes.

ConclusionsHap10 is a novel algorithm for haplotype assembly of polyploid genomes using linked reads. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated in a number of simulation scenarios and its applicability is demonstrated on a real dataset of sweet potato.","NA"

The resultant particle is called a 135S particle or A-particle and is thought to be on the pathway to a productive infection. Previously published studies have concluded that the membrane interactive peptides, namely VP4 and the N-terminus of VP1, are irreversibly externalized in the 135S particle. However, using established protocols to produce the 135S particle, and single particle cryo-electron microscopy methods, we have identified at least two unique states that we call the early and late 135S particle. Surprisingly, only in the ""late"" 135S particles have detectable levels of the VP1 N-terminus trapped outside the capsid. Moreover, we observe a distinct density inside the capsid that can be accounted for by VP4 that remains associated with the genome. Taken together our results conclusively demonstrate that the 135S particle is not a unique conformation, but rather a family of conformations that could exist simultaneously.

AUTHOR SUMMARYNonenveloped viruses need to provide mechanisms that allow their genomes to be delivered across membrane. This process remains poorly understood. For enterovirus such as poliovirus, genome delivery involves a program of conformational changes that include expansion of the particle and externalization of two normal internal peptides, VP4 and the VP1 N-terminus, which then insert into the cell membrane, triggering endocytosis and the creation of pores that facilitate the transfer of the viral RNA genome across the endosomal membrane. This manuscript describes five high-resolution cryo-EM structures of altered poliovirus particles that represent a number of intermediates along this pathway. The structures reveal several surprising findings, including the discovery of a new intermediate that is expanded but has not yet externalized the membrane interactive peptides, the clear identification of a unique exit site VP1 N-terminus, the demonstration that the externalized VP1 N-terminus partitions between two different sites in a temperature-dependent fashion, direct visualization of an amphipathic helix at the N-terminus of VP1 in an ideal position for interaction with cellular membranes, and the observation that a significant portion of VP4 remains inside the particle and accounts for a feature that had been previously ascribed to part of the viral RNA. These findings represent significant additions to our understanding of the cell entry process of an important class of human pathogens.","NA"

Either of the two loci has one non-functional allele (DPL1- and DPL2-). The hybrid pollen carrying both DPL1- and DPL2- will be sterility.

Comparing with the ancestral populations, DPL1- and DPL2- both showed reduce of diversities, however their frequencies increased in rice. We assume that the reduce of diversities due to the bottleneck effect of domestication while the loss of one copy was preferred by artificial selection for cost savings.","NA"

(2) The response that each mother transfers is uniform in each generation of her descendants. (3) The likelihood that an RNAi response would transmit to the progeny increases the more generations the response lasts, according to a ""hot hand"" principle. Mechanistically, the different parental ""inheritance states"" correspond to global changes in the expression levels of endogenous small RNAs, immune response genes, and targets of the conserved transcription factor HSF-1.

Their capacity to transfer biomolecules between cells has sparked efforts to bioengineer EVs as drug delivery vehicles. However, a better understanding of EV biogenesis mechanisms and function is required to unleash their considerable therapeutic potential. Here we demonstrate a novel role for GAPDH, a glycolytic enzyme, in EV assembly and secretion, and we exploit these findings to develop a GAPDH-based methodology to load therapeutic siRNAs onto EVs for targeted drug delivery to the brain. In a series of experiments, we observe high levels of GAPDH binding to the outer surface of EVs via a phosphatidylserine binding motif, designated as G58, and discover that the tetrameric nature of GAPDH promotes extensive EV aggregation. Studies in a Drosophila EV biogenesis model demonstrate that GAPDH is absolutely required for normal generation of intraluminal vesicles in endosomal compartments and promotes vesicle clustering both inside and outside the cell. Fusing a GAPDH-derived G58 peptide to dsRNA-binding motifs permits highly efficient loading of RNA-based drugs such as siRNA onto the surface of EVs. Such vesicles efficiently deliver siRNA to target cells in vitro and into the brain of a Huntingtons disease mouse model after systemic injection, resulting in silencing of the huntingtin gene in multiple anatomical regions of the brain and modulation of phenotypic features of disease. Taken together, our study demonstrates a novel role for GAPDH in EV biogenesis, and that the presence of free GAPDH binding sites on EVs can be effectively exploited to substantially enhance the therapeutic potential of EV-mediated drug delivery to the brain.","NA"

Understanding how corticostriatal circuits mediate behavioral selection and initiation in a naturalistic setting is critical to understanding how the brain chooses and executes behavior in unconstrained situations. Central striatum (CS), an understudied region that lies in the middle of the motor-limbic topography, is well-poised to play an important role in these processes since its main cortical inputs (Corbit et al., 2019) have been implicated in behavioral flexibility (lateral orbitofrontal cortex (Kim and Ragozzino, 2005)) and response preparation (anterior lateral motor area, ALM) (Li et al., 2015), However, although CS activity has been associated with conditioned grooming behavior in transgenic mice (Burguiere et al., 2013), the role of CS and its cortical inputs in the selection of spontaneous behaviors has not been explored. We therefore studied the role of CS corticostriatal circuits in behavioral selection in an open field context.

Surprisingly, using fiber photometry in this unconstrained environment, we found that population calcium activity in CS was specifically increased at onset of grooming, and not at onset of other spontaneous behaviors such as rearing or locomotion. Supporting a potential selective role for CS in the initiation of grooming, bilateral optogenetic stimulation of CS evoked immediate onset grooming-related movements. However, these movements resembled subcomponents of grooming behavior and not full-fledged grooming bouts, suggesting that additional input(s) are required to appropriately sequence and sustain this complex motor behavior once initiated. Consistent with this idea, optogenetic stimulation of CS inputs from ALM generated sustained grooming responses that evolved on a time-course paralleling CS activation monitored using single-cell calcium imaging. Furthermore, fiber photometry in ALM demonstrated a gradual ramp in calcium activity that peaked at time of grooming termination, supporting a potential role for ALM in encoding length of this spontaneous sequenced behavior. Finally, dual color dual region fiber photometry indicated that CS activation precedes ALM during naturalistic grooming sequences. Taken together, these data support a novel model in which CS activity is sufficient to initiate grooming behavior, but ALM activity is necessary to sustain and encode the length of grooming bouts. Thus, the use of an unconstrained behavioral paradigm has allowed us to uncover surprising roles for CS and ALM in the initiation and maintenance of spontaneous sequenced behaviors.","NA"

These results provided strong evidence for the state-separated storage of two sequential arrays in different neural states if the interval between them was long enough, and the concurrent storage of them in the active state if the interval was relatively short. This conclusion was valid only when the participants encountered the task for the first time. Once participants have formed their mindset, they would apply the same storage mode to the subsequently extended or shortened interval condition.","NA"

We find thalamic inputs make distinct connections in L1, where VM engages NDNF+ cells in L1a, and MD drives VIP+ cells in L1b. These separate populations of L1 interneurons participate in different disinhibitory networks in superficial layers by targeting either PV+ or SOM+ interneurons. NDNF+ cells also inhibit the apical dendrites of L5 pyramidal tract (PT) cells, where they suppress AP-evoked Ca2+ signals. Lastly, NDNF+ cells mediate a unique form of thalamus-evoked inhibition at PT cells, selectively blocking VM-evoked dendritic Ca2+ spikes.

Allen Miller","Iowa State University","2020-01-09",1,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","plant biology","Maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) combines with a potyvirus in maize lethal necrosis disease (MLND), an emerging disease worldwide that often causes catastrophic yield loss. To inform resistance strategies, we characterized the translation initiation mechanism of MCMV. We report that, like other tombusvirids, MCMV RNA contains a cap-independent translation element (CITE) in its 3 untranslated region (UTR). The MCMV 3 CITE (MTE) was mapped to nucleotides 4164-4333 in the genomic RNA. SHAPE probing revealed that the MTE is a variant of the panicum mosaic virus-like 3 CITE (PTE). Like the PTE, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) indicated that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binds the MTE despite the absence of a m7GpppN cap structure, which is normally required for eIF4E to bind RNA. The MTE interaction with eIF4E suggests eIF4E may be a soft target for engineered resistance to MCMV. Using a luciferase reporter system, mutagenesis to disrupt and restore base pairing revealed that the MTE interacts with the 5 UTRs of both genomic RNA and the 3-coterminal subgenomic RNA1 via long-distance kissing stem-loop base pairing to facilitate translation in wheat germ extract and in protoplasts. However, the MTE is a relatively weak stimulator of translation and has a weak, if any, pseudoknot, which is present in the most active PTEs. Most mutations designed to form a pseudoknot decreased translation activity. Mutations in the viral genome that reduced or restored translation prevented and restored virus replication, respectively, in maize protoplasts and in plants. We propose that MCMV, and some other positive strand RNA viruses, favors a weak translation element to allow highly efficient viral RNA synthesis.

Author SummaryIn recent years, maize lethal necrosis disease has caused massive crop losses in East Africa and Ecuador. It has also emerged in East Asia. Maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) infection is required for this disease. While some tolerant maize lines have been identified, there are no known resistance genes that confer full immunity to MCMV. In order to design better resistance strategies against MCMV, we focused on how the MCMV genome is translated, the first step of gene expression required for infection by all positive strand RNA viruses. We identified a structure (cap-independent translation element) in the 3 untranslated region of the viral RNA genome that allows the virus to usurp a host translation initiation factor in a way that differs from host mRNA interactions with the translational machinery. This difference may guide engineering of - or breeding for - resistance to MCMV. Moreover, this work adds to the diversity of known eukaryotic translation initiation mechanisms, as it provides more information on mRNA structural features that permit noncanonical interaction with a translation factor. Finally, owing to the conflict between ribosomes translating and viral replicase copying viral RNA, we propose that MCMV has evolved a relatively weak translation element in order to permit highly efficient RNA synthesis, and that this replication-translation trade-off may apply to other positive strand RNA viruses.","NA"

The explanatory theories of dominance and faster-X, which are based on recessive alleles being expressed in the heterogametic sex, have been proposed as common mechanisms. These mechanisms predict that greater hemizygosity leads to both faster evolution and greater expression of intrinsic postzygotic isolation. Under these mechanisms, haplodiploids should evolve and express intrinsic postzygotic isolation faster than diploids because the entire genome is analogous to a sex chromosome. Here, we measure sterility and inviability in hybrids between Neodiprion pinetum and N. lecontei, a pair of haplodiplopids that differ morphologically, behaviorally, and genetically. We compare the observed isolation to that expected from published estimates of isolation in diploids at comparable levels of genetic divergence. We find that both male and female hybrids are viable and fertile, which is less isolation than expected. We then discuss several potential explanations for this surprising lack of isolation, including alternative mechanisms for Haldanes rule and a frequently overlooked quirk of haplodiploid genetics that may slow the emergence of complete intrinsic postzygotic isolation in hybrid males. Finally, we describe how haplodiploids, an underutilized resource, can be used to differentiate between mechanisms of Haldanes rule.","NA"

CREB shut-off results in synaptic dysfunction and neuronal cell death and is elicited in Alzheimers disease (AD) by amyloid-{beta}-induced activation of extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors (NMDAR). Following long-distance transport from NMDAR to the nucleus the protein messenger Jacob docks a signalosome to CREB that encodes the synaptic or extrasynaptic origin of the NMDAR signal. In previous work we found that in response to cell survival/plasticity related synaptic NMDAR stimulation macromolecular transport of Jacob docks the MAP-kinase ERK to the CREB complex which results in sustained CREB phosphorylation. Here we show that in case of disease-related activation of extrasynaptic NMDAR by amyloid-{beta}, Jacob associates with protein phosphatase-1{gamma} (PP1{gamma}) and induces dephosphorylation and transcriptional inactivation of CREB. Binding of the adaptor protein LIM domain only 4 (LMO4) to Jacob distinguishes extrasynaptic from synaptic NMDAR signaling and determines the affinity for the association with PP1{gamma}. This mechanism contributes to transcriptional inactivation of CREB in response to extrasynaptic NMDAR signaling in the context of early synaptic dysfunction and cell loss in AD. Accordingly, Jacob protein knockdown attenuates CREB shut-off and cellular deterioration in response to amyloid-{beta} signaling and Jacob gene knock out is neuroprotective in a transgenic mouse model of AD.","NA"

Such a study yields a wealth of information on the electrolytic conditions inside the pore and on the scale the electrophoretic forces that drive molecular transport. To this end we have built a computationally efficient continuum model of ClyA which, together with an extended version of Poison-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (ePNP-NS) equations, faithfully reproduces its ionic conductance over a wide range of salt concentrations. These ePNP-NS equations aim to tackle the shortcomings of the traditional PNP-NS models by self-consistently taking into account the influence of both the ionic strength and the nanoscopic scale of the pore on all relevant electrolyte properties. In this study, we give both a detailed description of our ePNP-NS model and apply it to the ClyA nanopore. This enabled us to gain a deeper insight into the influence of ionic strength and applied voltage on the ionic conductance through ClyA and a plethora of quantities difficult to assess experimentally. The latter includes the cation and anion concentrations inside the pore, the shape of the electrostatic potential landscape and the magnitude of the electro-osmotic flow.

A better understanding of BC molecular processes is therefore of great interest to identify new therapeutic targets. Although large-scale efforts, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have completely redefined cancer drug development, diagnosis, and treatment, additional key aspects of tumor biology remain to be discovered. In that respect, post-transcriptional regulation of tumorigenesis represents an understudied aspect of cancer research. As key regulators of this process, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are emerging as critical modulators of tumorigenesis but only few have defined roles in BC. To unravel new putative BC RBPs, we have performed in silico analyses of all human RBPs in three major cancer databases (TCGA-Breast Invasive Carcinoma, the Human Protein Atlas, and the Cancer Dependency Map project) along with complementary bioinformatics resources (STRING protein-protein interactions and the Network of Cancer Genes 6.0). Thus, we have identified six putative BC progressors (MRPL13, SCAMP3, CDC5L, DARS2, PUF60, and PLEC), and five BC suppressors RBPs (SUPT6H, MEX3C, UPF1, CNOT1, and TNKS1BP1). These proteins have never been studied in BC but show similar cancer-associated features than well-known BC proteins. Further research should focus on the mechanisms by which these proteins promote or suppress breast tumorigenesis, holding the promise of new therapeutic pathways along with novel drug development strategies.","NA"

L.","Kimberly A Walker","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","2020-01-09",1,"cc_by","new results","microbiology","Klebsiella pneumoniae has a remarkable ability to cause a wide range of human diseases. It is divided into two broad classes: Classical strains that are a notable problem in healthcare settings due to multidrug resistance, and hypervirulent (hv) strains that are drug sensitive, but able to establish disease in immunocompetent hosts. Alarmingly, there has been an increased frequency of clinical isolates that have both drug resistance and hv-associated genes. One such gene is rmpA that encodes a transcriptional regulator required for maximal capsule (cps) gene expression and confers hypermucoviscosity (HMV). This link has resulted in the assumption that HMV is caused by elevated capsule production. However, we recently reported a new cps regulator, RmpC, and {Delta}rmpC mutants have reduced cps expression but remain HMV, suggesting that capsule and HMV may be separable traits. Here, we report the identification of a small protein, RmpD, that is essential for HMV, but does not impact capsule. RmpD is 58 residues with a putative N-terminal transmembrane domain and highly positively charged C-terminal half, and it is conserved among other hv K. pneumoniae strains. Expression of rmpD in trans complements both {Delta}rmpD and {Delta}rmpA mutants for HMV, suggesting that RmpD is the key driver of this phenotype. The rmpD gene is located between rmpA and rmpC, within an operon regulated by RmpA. This data, combined with our previous work, suggests a model in which the RmpA-associated phenotypes are largely due to RmpA activating the expression of rmpD to produce HMV and rmpC to stimulate cps expression.

SIGNIFICANCECapsule is a critical virulence factor in Klebsiella pneumoniae, in both antibiotic-resistant classical strains and hypervirulent strains. Hypervirulent strains usually have a hypermucoviscous (HMV) phenotype that contributes to their heightened virulence capacity, but the production of HMV is not understood. The transcriptional regulator RmpA is required for HMV and also activates capsule gene expression, leading to the assumption that HMV is caused by hyperproduction of capsule. We have identified a new gene (rmpD) required for HMV but does not contribute to capsule production. This distinction between HMV and capsule production will promote a better understanding of the mechanisms of hypervirulence, which is in great need given the alarming increase in clinical isolates with both drug resistance and hypervirulence traits.","NA"

By eliminating Vps34, the kinase responsible for synthesizing PI(3)P in RPE, we have found that PI(3)P plays distinct roles in each pathway. In phagocytosis it is not required for disk engulfment or phagosome transport but is essential for recruitment and lipidation of LC3. In contrast, initiation of autophagy and LC3 recruitment to autophagosomes does not require PI(3)P, which can be bypassed by an alternative mechanism of ATG16L recruitment that does not require PI(3)P, Rab11a, or WIPI2.

We focused on the head shape of aquatically foraging snakes as they fulfil several fitness-relevant functions and show a large amount of morphological variability. We used 3D surface scanning and 3D geometric-morphometrics to compare the head shape of 62 species in a phylogenetic context. We first tested whether diet specialization and size are drivers of head shape diversification. Next, we tested for many-to-one mapping by comparing the hydrodynamic efficiency of head shapes characteristic of the main axis of variation in the dataset. We 3D printed these shapes and measured the forces at play during a frontal strike. Our results show that diet and size explain only a small amount of shape variation. Shapes did not functionally converge as more specialized aquatic species evolved a more efficient head shape than others.

Nerve stimulation to achieve efficacious symptomatic relief depends on the proper selection of electrical stimulation parameters to recruit the appropriate fibers within a nerve. Recently, electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve has shown promise for controlling inflammation and clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. This application of vagus nerve stimulation activates the inflammatory reflex, reducing levels of inflammatory cytokines during inflammation. Here, we wanted to test whether altering the parameters of electrical vagus nerve stimulation would change circulating cytokine levels of normal healthy animals in the absence of increased inflammation. To examine this, we systematically tested a set of electrical stimulation parameters and measured serum cytokine levels in healthy mice. Surprisingly, we found that specific combinations of pulse width, pulse amplitude, and frequency produced significant increases of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), while other parameters selectively lowered serum TNF levels, as compared to sham-stimulated mice. In addition, serum levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) were significantly increased by select parameters of electrical stimulation but remained unchanged with others. These results indicate that electrical stimulation parameter selection is critically important for the modulation of cytokines via the cervical vagus nerve and that specific cytokines can be increased by electrical stimulation in the absence of inflammation. As the next generation of bioelectronic therapies and devices are developed to capitalize on the neural regulation of inflammation, the selection of nerve stimulation parameters will be a critically important variable for achieving cytokine-specific changes.","NA"

In a modified Theory of Visual Attention (TVA; Bundesen, 1990) paradigm, participants reported briefly presented letters during eye, hand, or combined eye-hand movement preparation to centrally cued locations. Modeling the data according to the TVA allowed us to assess both the overall attention capacity as well as the deployment of visual attention to individual locations in the visual work space. In two experiments, we show that attention was predominantly allocated to the motor targets - without competition between effectors. The parallel benefits at eye and hand targets, however, had concomitant costs at non-motor locations, and the overall attention capacity was not increased by the simultaneous recruitment of both effector systems. Moreover, premotor shifts of attention dominated over voluntary deployment of processing resources, yielding severe impairments of voluntary attention allocation. We conclude that attention shifts to multiple effector targets without mutual competition, given that sufficient processing resources can be withdrawn from movement-irrelevant locations.","NA"

ConclusionOverall, these observations suggest the anticancer activities of the ethyl acetate extract of S. anacardium leaves. The study opens a new window to examine the phytochemical constituents from the leaves as a source for the anticancer compounds.

However, current experimental methods cannot accurately measure such metabolic flux differences genome-wide. To address this short-coming, we apply FALCON, a computational algorithm for inferring metabolic fluxes from gene expression data, to analyze data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found several major differences between tumor and control tissue metabolism. Cancer tissues have a considerably stronger correlation between RNA-seq expression and inferred metabolic flux, which may indicate a more streamlined and efficient use of metabolism. Cancer metabolic fluxes generally have high correlation with their normal control counterparts in the same tissue, but surprisingly, there are several cases where tumor samples in one tissue have even higher correlation with control samples in another tissue. Finally, we found several pathways that frequently have divergent flux between tumor and control samples. Among these are several previously implicated in tumorigenesis, including sphingolipid metabolism, methionine and cysteine synthesis, and bile acid transformations. Together, these findings show how cancer metabolism differs from normal tissues and may be targeted in order to control cancer progression.","NA"

A.","Yue Li","McGill University","2020-01-09",1,"cc_no","new results","bioinformatics","MotivationUnderstanding the biological mechanism of complex phenotypes is challenging due to the lack of efficient approaches that can associate the vast majority of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci in the non-coding regions of the human genome with relevant genes and ultimately the downstream pathways. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) provides a way to associate genes with phenotype of interest by correlating GWAS summary statistics with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) summary statistics obtained from a reference panel. However, genes that are correlated by the predicted gene expression may exhibit high TWAS statistic even though they are the causal genes for the trait. Existing gene set enrichment analysis assume independence of genes and may therefore lead to false discoveries.

ResultsWe propose a novel statistical method called Gene Score Regression (GSR). The rationale of GSR is based on the insight that genes that are highly correlated with the causal genes in the causal gene set or pathways will exhibit high marginal TWAS statistic. Consequently, by regressing on the genes marginal statistic using the sum of the gene-gene correlation scores in each gene set, we can assess the amount of phenotypic variance explained by the predicted expression of the genes in that gene set. Our approach does not only operates on summary statistics without requiring individual genotype and phenotype but can also work with observed gene expression and phenotype data without the need of genotype. Based on simulation, GSR demonstrates superior power and better controlled Type I Error rate over the existing methods.

We applied GSR to investigate 28 complex traits using diverse genome-wide and knowledge-based gene sets such as REACTOME and KEGG from MSigDB and also 205 cell-type-specific gene sets derived from observed gene expression. The significant gene sets detected by GSR are by and large consistent with the known biology of the traits. We also demonstrated the utility of using GSR on cancer data where only gene expression and tumor/normal tissue labels are available. Overall, GSR is not only accurate but efficient method usually taking less than 5 minutes to perform the full analysis on one phenotype, thereby presenting as a significantly useful novel contribution to the analytical bioinformatic pipeline.

However, the mechanism of the heterodimer separation is not clear. In the present study, we have obtained evidence that the N-acetylation of Thr2 on EsxA, a post-translational modification that is present in mycobacteria, but absent in E. coli, is required for the heterodimer separation. The point mutations at Thr2 without N-acetylation inhibited the heterodimer separation and hence prevented EsxA from interacting with the membranes, which resulted in attenuated mycobacterial cytosolic translocation and virulence. Molecular dynamic simulation showed that at low pH the N-acetylated Thr2 made direct and frequent ""bind-and-release"" contacts with EsxB, which generates a dragging force to pull EsxB away from EsxA.","NA"

Inbred or hybrid plant breeding programs must make crosses, produce inbred individuals, and phenotype inbred lines or their hybrid test-crosses to select and validate superior material for product release. These products are few, and while it is clear that population improvement is necessary for continued genetic gain, it may not be sufficient to generate superior products. Rapid-cycle recurrent truncation genomic selection has been proposed to increase genetic gain by reducing generation time. This strategy has been shown to increase short-term gains, but can quickly lead to loss of genetic variance through inbreeding as relationships drive prediction. The optimal contribution of each individual can be determined to maximize gain in the following generation while limiting inbreeding. While optimal contribution strategies can maintain genetic variance in later generations, they suffer from a lack of short-term gains in doing so. We present a hybrid approach that branches out yearly to push the genetic value of potential varietal materials while maintaining genetic variance in the recurrent population, such that a breeding program can achieve short-term success without exhausting long-term potential. Because branching increases the genetic distance between the phenotyping pipeline and the recurrent population, this method requires sacrificing some trial plots to phenotype materials directly out of the recurrent population. We envision the phenotypic pipeline not only for selection and validation, but as an information generator to build predictive models and develop new products.","NA"

Currently, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is utilized in hospitals for VAP diagnosis and guiding treatment options. While BAL collection procedures are invasive, alternatives such as endotracheal aspirates (ETA) may be of diagnostic value, however, their utility has not been thoroughly explored. Longitudinal ETA and BAL were collected from 16 intubated patients up to 15 days, of which 11 developed VAP. We conducted a comprehensive LC-MS/MS based proteome and metabolome characterization of longitudinal ETA and BAL to detect host and pathogen responses to VAP infection. We discovered a diverse ETA proteome of the upper airways reflective of a rich and dynamic host-microbe interface. Prior to VAP diagnosis by microbial cultures from BAL, patient ETA presented characteristic signatures of reactive oxygen species and neutrophil degranulation, indicative of neutrophil mediated pathogen processing as a key host response to the VAP infection. Along with an increase in amino acids, this is suggestive of extracellular membrane degradation resulting from proteolytic activity of neutrophil proteases. Days prior to VAP diagnosis, detection of pathogen peptides with species level specificity in ETA may increase specificity over culture-based diagnosis. Our findings suggest that ETA may provide early mechanistic insights into host-pathogen interactions associated with VAP infection and therefore facilitate its diagnosis and treatment.

Tumors express a composite of self- and tumor-specific antigens and engage both Tconv and Treg cells. Along the aging process, the thymus involutes, and tumor incidence increases, a correlation proposed previously to be causal and the result of effector cell decline. In this work, we directly tested whether interruption of thymic activity in adult mice affects Foxp3 expressing Treg composition and function, and alters tumor immune surveillance. Young adult mice, on two different genetic backgrounds, were surgically thymectomized (TxT) and analyzed or challenged 2 months later. Cellular analysis revealed a 10-fold decrease in both Tconv and Treg numbers and a bias for activated cells. The persisting Treg displayed reduced stability of Foxp3 expression and, as a population, showed compromised return to homeostasis upon induced perturbations. We next tested the growth of three tumor models from different origin and presenting distinct degrees of spontaneous immunogenicity. In none of these conditions adult TxT facilitated tumor growth. Rather TxT enhanced the efficacy of anti-tumor immunotherapies targeting Treg and/or the checkpoint CTLA4, as evidenced by increased frequency of responder mice and decreased intra-tumoral Treg to CD8+IFN{gamma}+ cell ratio. Together, our findings point to a scenario where abrogation of thymic activities affects preferentially the regulatory over the ridding arm of the immune activities elicited by tumors, and argues that higher incidence of tumors with age cannot be solely attributed to thymic output decline.","NA"

H.; Amann, R.; Arnosti, C.","Carol Arnosti","University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill","2020-01-09",1,"cc_by","new results","microbiology","Spring phytoplankton blooms in temperate environments contribute disproportionately to global marine productivity. Bloom-derived organic matter, much of it occurring as polysaccharides, fuels biogeochemical cycles driven by interacting autotrophic and heterotrophic communities. We tracked changes in the mode of polysaccharide utilization by heterotrophic bacteria during the course of a diatom-dominated bloom in the German Bight, North Sea. Polysaccharides can be taken up in a  selfish mode, where initial hydrolysis is coupled to transport into the periplasm, such that little to no low molecular weight (LMW) products are externally released to the environment. Alternatively, polysaccharides hydrolyzed by cell-surface attached or free extracellular enzymes (external hydrolysis) yield LMW products available to the wider bacterioplankton community. In the early bloom phase, selfish activity was accompanied by low extracellular hydrolysis rates of a few polysaccharides. As the bloom progressed, selfish uptake increased markedly, and external hydrolysis rates increased, but only for a limited range of substrates. The late bloom phase was characterized by high external hydrolysis rates of a broad range of polysaccharides, and reduced selfish uptake of polysaccharides, except for laminarin. Substrate utilization mode is related both to substrate structural complexity and to the bloom-stage dependent composition of the heterotrophic bacterial community.

Originality statementThe means by which heterotrophic bacteria cooperate and compete to obtain substrates is a key factor determining the rate and location at which organic matter is cycled in the ocean. Much of this organic matter is high molecular weight (HMW), and must be enzymatically hydrolyzed to smaller pieces to be processed by bacterial communities. Some of these enzyme-producing bacteria are  selfish, processing HMW organic matter without releasing low molecular weight (LMW) products to the environment. Other bacteria hydrolyze HMW substrates in a manner that releases LMW products to the wider bacterial community. How these mechanisms of substrate hydrolysis work against a changing background of organic matter supply is unclear. Here, we measured changing rates and mechanisms of substrate processing during the course of a natural phytoplankton bloom in the North Sea. Selfish bacteria generally dominate in the initial bloom stages, but a greater supply of increasingly complex substrates in later bloom stages leads to external hydrolysis of a wider range of substrates, increasing the supply of LMW hydrolysis products to the wider bacterial community.","10.1111/1462-2920.14971"

Meanwhile, 10 were put into high-fat diet with swimming group and 7 were just for refeeding normal diet group. Then the data of body weight was recorded and analyzed. Serum, pancreas, liver, cardiac tissues and epididymis adipose were sampled as required. Indexes of serum were tested by kits. AMPK, HNF1, CTRP6 from tissues were detected by western blot. According to our experiments, Swimming and refeeding groups reflected a better regulation on lipid homeostasis mainly by up-regulating the expression of pancreas AMPK. To be more specific, the refeeding rats showed lower T-CHO (P<0.001) and LDL-C (P<0.05), but higher weight gain (P<0.001),insulin level (P<0.01)and pancreas AMPK (P<0.01)than high-fat control rats.

The pathophysiology of the resulting brain injury is poorly understood and whether changes in post-CA brain metabolism contribute to the injury are unknown. Here we utilized [18F]FDG-PET to study in vivo cerebral glucose metabolism 72 hours following CA in a murine cardiac arrest model.

MethodsAnesthetized and ventilated adult C57BL/6 mice underwent 12-minute KCl-induced CA followed by CPR. Seventy-two hours following cardiac arrest, surviving mice were intraperitoneally injected with [18F]FDG (~186 Ci/200 L) and imaged on Molecubes preclinical micro PET/CT imaging systems after a 30-minute awake uptake period. Brain [18F]FDG uptake was determined by the VivoQuant software on fused PET/CT images with the 3D brain atlas. Upon completion of PET imaging, remaining [18F]FDG radioactivity in the brain, heart, and liver was determined using a gamma counter.

ResultsGlobal increases in brain [18F]FDG uptake in post-CA mice were observed compared to shams and controls. The median standardized uptake value (SUV) of [18F]FDG for CA animals was 1.79 vs. sham 1.25 (p<0.05) and control animals 0.78 (p<0.01). This increased uptake was consistent throughout the 60-minute imaging period and across all brain regions reaching statistical significance in the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Biodistribution analyses of various key organs yielded similar observations that the median [18F]FDG uptake for brain were 7.04%ID/g tissue for CA mice vs 5.537%ID/g tissue for sham animals, p<0.05).

ConclusionsThis study has successfully applied [18F]FDG-PET/CT to measure changes in brain metabolism in a murine model of asystolic CA. Our results demonstrate increased [18F]FDG uptake in the brain 72 hours following CA, suggesting increased metabolic demand in the case of severe neurological injury. Further study is warranted to determine the etiology of these changes.","NA"

We demonstrate how parameters of a cone, an OFF- and an ON-cone bipolar cell model can be inferred from standard two-photon glutamate imaging with simple light stimuli. The inference method starts with a prior distribution informed by literature knowledge and yields a posterior distribution over parameters highlighting parameters consistent with the data. This posterior allows determining how well parameters are constrained by the data and to what extent changes in one parameter can be compensated for by changes in another. To demonstrate the potential of such data-driven mechanistic neuron models, we created a simulation environment for external electrical stimulation of the retina as used in retinal neuroprosthetic devices. We used the framework to optimize the stimulus waveform to selectively target OFF- and ON-cone bipolar cells, a current major problem of retinal neuroprothetics. Taken together, this study demonstrates how a data-driven Bayesian simulation-based inference approach can be used to estimate parameters of complex mechanistic models with high-throughput imaging data.","NA"

In addition, the effects of methylphenidate, a substitute medication for cocaine dependence, on fly brain lipids after cocaine abuse are also determined to see if it can rescue the lipid changes caused by cocaine. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry with a (CO2)6000+ gas cluster ion beam was used to detect intact phospholipids. We show that cocaine has persistent effects, both increasing and decreasing the levels of specific phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylinositols. These changes remain after cocaine withdrawal and are not rescued by methylphenidate. Cocaine is again shown to generally increase the levels of phosphatidylcholines in the fly brain; however, after drug withdrawal the abundance of these lipids returns to the original level and methylphenidate treatment of the flies following cocaine exposure enhances the reversal of the lipid level reducing them below the original control. The study provides insight into the molecular effects of cocaine and methylphenidate on brain lipids.

We report here that the spatial position, rather than visual features, of choice targets drives the lose-shift effect. Furthermore, the ability to inhibit lose-shift responding to gain reward is different among male and female habitual cannabis users. Increased self-reported cannabis use was concordant with suppressed response flexibility and an increased tendency to lose-shift in women, which reduced performance in a choice task in which random responding is the optimal strategy. On the other hand, increased cannabis use in men was concordant with reduced reliance on spatial cues during decision-making, and had no impact on the number of correct responses.

We aimed to produce an enriched, concentrated, well-settling, nutrient-removing PNSB biomass using sequencing batch regimes (SBR) in an anaerobic photobioreactor. The stirred tank was fed with a synthetic influent mimicking loaded municipal wastewater (430-860 mg CODAc LInf-1, COD:N:P ratio of 100:36:4-100:11:2 m/m/m), operated at 30{degrees}C and pH 7, and continuously irradiated with infrared (IR) light (>700 nm) at 375 W m-2. After inoculation with activated sludge at 0.1 g VSS L-1, PNSB were rapidly enriched in a first batch of 24 h: the genus Rhodobacter reached 54% of amplicon sequencing read counts. SBR operations at volume exchange ratio of 50% with decreasing hydraulic retention times (48 to 16 h; 1 to 3 cycles d-1) and increasing volumetric organic loading rates (0.2 to 1.3 kg COD m-3 d-1) stimulated the aggregation (compact granules of 50-150 m), settling (sedimentation G-flux of 4.7 kg h-1 m-2), and accumulation (as high as 3.8 g VSS L-1) of biomass. The sludge retention time (SRT) increased freely from 2.5 to 11 d without controlled sludge wasting. Acetate, ammonium, and orthophosphate were removed simultaneously (up to 96% at a rate of 1.1 kg COD m-3 d-1, 77% at 113 g N m-3 d-1, and 73% at 15 g P m-3 d-1) with a COD:N:P assimilation ratio of 100:6.7:0.9 (m/m/m).

SBR regime shifts sequentially selected for Rhodobacter (90%) under shorter SRT and non-limiting acetate concentrations during reaction phases, Rhodopseudomonas (70%) under longer SRT and acetate limitation, and Blastochloris (10%) under higher biomass concentrations. We highlighted the benefits of a PNSB-based SBR process for biomass accumulation and simultaneous nutrient capture at substantial rates, and its underlying microbial ecology.

Phase-resolved optical coherence tomography (pOCT) measurements of the optical path length (OPL) change in the cone photoreceptor outer segments after a light stimulus (optoretinogram) reveal a fast, ms-scale contraction by tens of nm, followed by a slow (hundreds of ms) elongation reaching hundreds of nm. Ultrafast measurements with a line-scan pOCT system show that the contractile response amplitude increases logarithmically with the number of incident photons, and its peak shifts earlier at higher stimulus intensities.

We present a model that accounts for these features of the contractile response. Conformational changes in opsins after photoisomerization result in the fractional shift of charge across the disk membrane, leading to a transmembrane voltage change, known as the early receptor potential (ERP). Lateral repulsion of the ions on both sides of the membrane affects its surface tension and leads to its lateral expansion. Since the volume of the disks does not change much on a ms time scale, their lateral expansion leads to an axial contraction of the outer segment. With increasing stimulus intensity and resulting tension, the area expansion coefficient of the disk membrane also increases as thermally-induced fluctuations are pulled flat, resisting further expansion. This results in a logarithmic saturation of the deformation and a peak shift to earlier with brighter stimuli. Slow expansion of the photoreceptors is explained by the influx of water due to osmotic changes during phototransduction. Both effects closely match measurements in healthy human volunteers.","NA"

Stalling or slowing of the replication fork as a result of replication stress leads to formation of aberrant single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) stretches and potentially DNA double-stranded-breaks (DSBs). Accumulation of ssDNA activates the ATR-dependent DNA replication stress checkpoint response that slows progression from S/G2- to M-phase to protect genomic integrity (1). However, whether mild replication stress restricts proliferation remains controversial (2-6). Here we identify a novel cell cycle exit mechanism, that prevents S/G2 phase arrested cells from undergoing mitosis after exposure to mild replication stress through premature activation of the CDH1 bound Anaphase Promoting Complex / Cyclosome (APC/CCDH1). We find that replication stress causes a gradual decrease of the levels of the APC/CCDH1 inhibitor EMI1/FBXO5 through Forkhead Box O (FOXOs) mediated repression of its transcriptional regulator E2F1. By doing so, FOXOs limit the time during which the replication stress checkpoint is reversible, and thereby play an important role in maintaining genomic stability.","NA"

In contrast, repair of damage is present in all organisms studied. Repair and segregation of damage have not always been considered as alternatives, despite the fundamental trade-off between investing resources into repair or growth. For unicellular organisms, unrepaired damage could be divided asymmetrically between daughter cells, leading to aging of one and rejuvenation of the other. Repair of unicells has been shown to be advantageous in well-mixed environments such as chemostats. However, most microorganisms live in spatially structured systems such as biofilms with gradients of environmental conditions and cellular physiology as well as clonal population structure. We asked whether this clonal structure might favor aging by damage segregation as this can be seen as a division of labor strategy, akin to the germline soma division in multicellular organisms. We used an individual-based model with a newly developed adaptive repair strategy where cells respond to their current intracellular damage levels by investing into repair machinery accordingly. We found that the new adaptive repair strategy was advantageous whenever efficient and optimal, both in biofilms and chemostats. Thus, biofilms do not favor a germline soma-like division of labor between daughter cells in terms of damage segregation. We suggest that damage segregation is only beneficial when active and effective, extrinsic mortality is high and a degree of multicellularity is present.

IMPORTANCEDamage is an inevitable consequence of life, leading to a trade-off between allocating resources into damage repair or into growth whilst allowing aging, i.e., segregation of damage upon cell division. Few studies considered repair as an alternative to aging. Moreover, all previous studies merely considered well-mixed environments, although the vast majority of unicellular organisms live in spatially structured environments, exemplified by biofilms, and fitness advantages in well-mixed systems often turn into disadvantages in spatially structured systems. We compared the fitness consequences of aging versus damage repair in biofilms with an individual-based model implementing an adaptive repair mechanism based on sensing damage. We found that aging is not beneficial. Instead, it is useful as a stress response to deal with damage that failed to be repaired when (i) clearly asymmetric cell division is feasible; (ii) extrinsic mortality is high; and (iii) a degree of multicellularity is present.","NA"

In the present study we aim to show if a direct interaction occurs between S. aureus and bone marrow derived MSCs and identify if MSCRAMMs have a role in this interaction. We further aim to compare S. aureus interaction with cells that differentiate from MSCs, namely; osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes, since MSCs co-exist in the niche of these cells. Our results showed that S. aureus is able to interact with MSCs in the form of adhesion and invasion to the cells, and that this interaction is largely dependent on the expression of fibronecting-binding protein (FnBP) by S. aureus.

We found that ZNF704 acts as transcription repressor and interacts with the transcription corepressor SIN3A complex. Genome-wide interrogation of the transcriptional targets identifies that the ZNF704/SIN3A complex represses a panel of genes including PER2 that are critically involved in the function of circadian clock. Indeed, ZNF704 overexpression prolongs the period and dampens the amplitude of circadian clock. We showed that ZNF704 promotes the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro and accelerates the growth and metastasis of breast cancer in vivo. Consistently, the level of ZNF704 expression is inversely correlated with that of PER2 in breast carcinomas, and high level of ZNF704 correlates with advanced histological grades, lymph node positivity, and poor prognosis of breast cancer patients, especially those with HER2+ and basal-like subtypes.

While the relative abundance of a gene subfamily in the subgenome may reflect its functional importance, tests based on this expectation can be confounded by the complex relationship between the birth-death process of gene subfamily evolution and the species phylogeny. Using simulations, we confirmed tree heterogeneity as a confounding factor in inferring multi-gene adaptation, causing spurious associations between shifts in birth-death rate and lineages with higher branching rates. We then used the olfactory receptor (OR) repertoire, the largest gene family in the mammalian genome, of different bat species with divergent diets to test whether expansions in olfactory receptors are associated with shifts to frugivorous diets. After accounting for tree heterogeneity, we robustly inferred that certain OR subfamilies exhibited expansions associated with dietary shifts to frugivory. Taken together, these results suggest ecological correlates of individual OR gene subfamilies can be identified, setting the stage for detailed inquiry into within-subfamily functional differences.","NA"

This therapy, which was successfully used to treat a variety of infections in the early twentieth century, had been largely dismissed due to the discovery of easy to use antibiotics. However, the continuing emergence of antibiotic resistance has motivated new interest in the use of phage therapy to treat bacterial infections. Though various models have been developed to address the AMR-related issues, there are very few studies that consider the effect of phage-antibiotic combination therapy. Moreover, some of biological details such as the effect of the immune system on phage have been neglected. To address these limitations, we utilized a mathematical model to examine the role of the immune response in concert with phage-antibiotic combination therapy compounded with the effects of the immune system on the phages being used for treatment. We explore the effect of phage-antibiotic combination therapy by adjusting the phage and antibiotics dose or altering the timing. The model results show that it is important to consider the host immune system in the model and that frequency and dose of treatment are important considerations for the effectiveness of treatment.

While model selection is regarded as a fundamental step in phylogenetics, existing methods for this task consume computational resources for long processing time, they are not always feasible, and sometimes depend on preliminary assumptions which do not hold for sequence data. Moreover, while these methods are dedicated to revealing the processes that underlie the sequence data, in most cases they do not produce the most accurate trees. Notably, phylogeny reconstruction consists of two related tasks, topology reconstruction and branch-length estimation. It was previously shown that in many cases the most complex model, GTR+I+G, leads to topologies that are as accurate as using existing model selection criteria, but overestimates branch lengths. Here, we present ModelTeller, a computational methodology for phylogenetic model selection, devised within the machine-learning framework, optimized to predict the most accurate model for branch-length estimation accuracy. ModelTeller relies on a readily implemented machine-learning model and thus the prediction according to features extracted from the sequence data results in a substantial decrease in running time compared to existing strategies. We show that on datasets simulated under simple homogenous substitution models ModelTeller leads to branch-length estimation that is as accurate as the statistical model selection criteria. We then demonstrate that ModelTeller outperforms these criteria when more intricate patterns - that aim at mimicking realistic processes - are considered.","NA"

As a result, HCMV infections are highly problematic in individuals with weakened or underdeveloped immune systems including transplant recipients and newborns. Understanding how HCMV controls the microenvironment of an infected cell so as to favor productive replication is of critical importance. To this end, we took an unbiased proteomics approach to identify the highly reversible, stress induced, post-translational modification (PTM), protein S-nitrosylation, on viral proteins to determine the biological impact on viral replication.

We identified protein S-nitrosylation of 13 viral proteins during infection of highly permissive fibroblasts. One of these proteins, pp71, is critical for efficient viral replication, as it undermines host antiviral responses, including STING activation. By exploiting site-directed mutagenesis of the specific amino acids we identified in pp71 as protein S-nitrosylated, we found this pp71 PTM diminishes its ability to undermine antiviral responses induced by the STING pathway. Our results suggest a model in which protein S-nitrosylation may function as a host response to viral infection that limits viral spread.

IMPORTANCEIn order for a pathogen to establish a successful infection, it must undermine the host cell responses inhibitory to the pathogen. As such, herpesviruses encode multiple viral proteins that antagonize each host antiviral response, thereby allowing for efficient viral replication. Human Cytomegalovirus encodes several factors that limit host countermeasures to infection, including pp71. We identified a previously unreported modification of pp71 residues within the protein are protein S-nitrosylated. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we mutated the specific sites of this modification thereby blocking this pp71 post-translational modification. In contexts where pp71 is not protein S-nitrosylated, host antiviral response was inhibited. The net result of this post-translational modification is to render a viral protein with diminished abilities to block host responses to infection. This novel work supports a model in which protein S-nitrosylation may be an additional mechanism in which a cell inhibits a pathogen during the course of infection.","NA"

Here, we propose several types of contextual modulation for associative memory networks that greatly increase their performance. In these networks, context inactivates specific neurons and connections, which modulates the effective connectivity of the network. Memories are stored only by the active components, thereby reducing interference from memories acquired in other contexts. Such networks exhibit several beneficial characteristics, including enhanced memory capacity, high robustness to noise, increased robustness to memory overloading, and better memory retention during continual learning. Furthermore, memories can be biased to have different relative strengths, or even gated on or off, according to contextual cues, providing a candidate model for cognitive control of memory and efficient memory search. An external context-encoding network can dynamically switch the memory network to a desired state, which we liken to experimentally observed contextual signals in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Overall, our work illustrates the benefits of organizing memory around context, and provides an important link between behavioral studies of memory and mechanistic details of neural circuits.

SIGNIFICANCEMemory is context dependent -- both encoding and recall vary in effectiveness and speed depending on factors like location and brain state during a task. We apply this idea to a simple computational model of associative memory through contextual gating of neurons and synaptic connections. Intriguingly, this results in several advantages, including vastly enhanced memory capacity, better robustness, and flexible memory gating. Our model helps to explain (i) how gating and inhibition contribute to memory processes, (ii) how memory access dynamically changes over time, and (iii) how context representations, such as those observed in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, may interact with and control memory processes.","NA"

Principal dimensions of this manifold recapitulated established sensory-limbic and anterior-posterior gradients of brain organisation, and were found to reflect neural and glial gradients of cytoarchitectural organisation and gene expression.

This is considered to be mediated by changes in the metabolism of the hormones gibberellins (GAs), which promote the degradation of DELLAs. However, here we show that warm temperature or shade reduced the stability of a GA-insensitive DELLA allele in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the degradation of DELLA induced by the warmth anticipated changes in GA levels and depended on the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1). COP1 enhanced the degradation of normal and GA-insensitive DELLA alleles when co-expressed in N. benthamiana. DELLA proteins physically interacted with COP1 in yeast, mammalian and plant cells. This interaction was enhanced by the COP1 complex partner SUPRESSOR OF phyA-105 1 (SPA1). The level of ubiquitination of DELLA was enhanced by COP1 and COP1 ubiquitinated DELLA proteins in vitro. We propose that DELLAs are destabilized not only by the canonical GA-dependent pathway but also by COP1 and that this control is relevant for growth responses to shade and warm temperature.

DELLAs are destabilized by the growth-promoting hormone gibberellin, whose levels are very sensitive to environmental changes. Here we describe an alternative pathway to destabilize these proteins. We show that DELLAs are substrate of COP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that increases its nuclear activity to promote growth in response to shade or warmth. Our results also show that the destabilization of DELLAs by COP1 precedes the action of gibberellins, suggesting the existence of a sequential mechanism to control the stability of these proteins.","NA"

Surgery is the principle treatment but complete resection can be challenging due to the location of the tumours in the spine and therefore finding an effective drug treatment is a pressing unmet clinical need. A major recent study identified the transcription factor Brachyury as the primary vulnerability and drug target in chordoma. Previously, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been shown to negatively influence expression of the Brachyury gene, TBXT. Here we extend this finding and demonstrate that ATRA lowers Brachyury protein levels in chordoma cells and reduces proliferation of the chordoma cell line U-CH1 as well as causing a morphological change commensurate with differentiation. ATRA is available as a generic drug and is the first line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). This study implies ATRA could have therapeutic value if repurposed for chordoma.","NA"

Small molecule inhibitors targeting either the elements of the regulatory pathways controlling cytokinesis, or the terminal effectors have been of interest as potential drug candidates for the treatment of various diseases. Here we have developed a cell-based assay for the discovery of novel cytokinesis inhibitors. The assay is performed in a 96-well plate format in 48 hours. Living cells, nuclei and nuclei of dead cells are revealed by a single staining step with three fluorescent dyes, followed by live cell imaging using an automated fluorescence microscope. The primary signal is the nuclei-to-cell ratio (NCR). In the presence of cytokinesis inhibitors, this ratio is expected to increase over time, as the ratio of multinucleated cells increases in the population. Cytotoxicity is quantified as the ratio of dead nuclei to total nuclei. A screening window coefficient (Z) of 0.65 indicates that the assay is suitable for screening purposes, as the positive and negative controls are well-separated. EC50 values for four compounds can be reliably determined in a single 96-well plate by using only six different compound concentrations. An excellent test-retest reliability (R2=0.998) was found for EC50 values covering a [~]1500-fold range of potencies. The robustness, simplicity and flexibility of the assay is demonstrated here by using modulators of actin dynamics with different mechanisms of action (jasplakinolide, cytochalasin D and swinholide A) and derivatives of the nonmuscle myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin.","NA"

Using a genetically engineered mouse model of breast cancer recurrence, we show that recurrent mammary tumors undergo widespread epigenomic and transcriptional alterations, and acquire dependence on the G9a histone methyltransferase. Genetic ablation of G9a delays tumor recurrence, and pharmacologic inhibition of G9a slows the growth of recurrent tumors. Mechanistically, G9a activity is required to silence pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, through H3K9 methylation at gene promoters. G9a inhibition induces re-expression of these cytokines, leading to p53 activation and necroptosis. Recurrent tumors upregulate receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) expression and are dependent upon RIPK3 activity. High RIPK3 expression renders recurrent tumors sensitive to necroptosis following G9a inhibition. These findings demonstrate that epigenetic rewiring - specifically G9a-mediated silencing of pro-necroptotic proteins - is a critical step in tumor recurrence and suggest that G9a is a targetable dependency in recurrent breast cancer.","NA"

Despite accruing evidence establishing a link between deregulation of epitranscriptome-related players and tumorigenic process, the role of messenger RNA (mRNA) modifications dynamic in the regulation of CSC properties remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the cytoplasmic pool of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) impedes CSC abilities in colorectal cancer through its m6Am (N6,2-O-dimethyladenosine) demethylase activity. While m6Am is strategically located next to the m7G-mRNA cap, its biological function is not well understood and has not been addressed in cancer. Low FTO expression in patient-derived cell lines elevates m6Am level in mRNA which results in enhanced in vivo tumorigenicity and chemoresistance. Inhibition of the nuclear m6Am methyltransferase, PCIF1/CAPAM, partially reverses this phenotype. FTO-mediated regulation of m6Am marking constitutes a novel, reversible pathway controlling CSC abilities that does not involve transcriptome remodeling, but could fine-tune translation efficiency of selected m6Am marked transcripts. Altogether, our findings bring to light the first biological function of the m6Am modification and its potential adverse consequences for colorectal cancer management.","NA"

We found that CB1-iLTD in acute rat hippocampal slices was associated with protein synthesis-dependent presynaptic structural changes. Using proteomics, we determined that CB1 activation in hippocampal neurons resulted in increased ribosomal proteins and initiation factors, but decreased levels of proteins involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, such as Arp2/3, and presynaptic release. Moreover, while CB1-iLTD increased ubiquitin/proteasome activity, ubiquitination but not proteasomal degradation was critical for structural and functional presynaptic CB1-iLTD. Thus, CB1-iLTD relies on both protein synthesis and ubiquitination to elicit structural changes that underlie long-term reduction of GABA release.","NA"

The active extract was evaluated for mode of cell death induction using EtBr-AO double staining and analyzed for phytochemical constituents using GC-MS, followed by molecular docking studies for exploration of possibility for anticancer agents and Drugability. In this study, ethyl acetate extract of leaf was found potent cytotoxic in MCF-7 cells and also induced apoptosis. It has also found the SLE is safe for normal cells. The molecular docking studies were done to explore the probable mechanism of action of the extract which showed 9 compounds are targeting the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). MAPT promotes assembling and prevents disassembling to arrest the cell cycle. The overexpression of MAPT induces chemoresistance to cancerous cells against conventional drugs like paclitaxel.

We inferred phylogenetic relationships based on more than 34,000 RAD loci of 27 species. Phylogenetic analyses recovered a well-resolved tree topology with two major clades, the Eurasian and the HDM clade and a divergence time of c. 23.9 Ma. The HDM clade comprises two subclades. The species of the HDM clade originated in north HDM and adjacent areas and then dispersed into the south HDM, westwards to the Himalayas and eastwards to the Qinling Mountains. Niche modelling analyses revealed that during the last glacial maximum, range contractions were observed in the northern areas, while southward expansions resulted in range overlaps. The reconstruction of putative adaptive character evolution of plant height, inflorescence and flower morphology indicate that adaptations to altitudinal distribution contributed to the diversification of the HDM willows. Our data indicate that a radiation occurred in HDM within the Salix Chamaetia-Vetrix clade. Dispersal within the mountain system and to adjacent regions as well as survival in glacial refugia have shaped the biogeographical history of the clade. Differentiation along altitudinal zonation concomitant to morphological adaptations to colder climates may be important ecological factors for the high species diversity of Salix in this area.","NA"

Our protein screen clearly defined two cohorts of putative targets either in the presence of magnesium ions or in metal-free conditions. The highest number of protein targets was detected in the absence of metal ions, with an overrepresentation of proteins involved in purine metabolism, protein phosphorylation, nucleosome assembly, cell redox homeostasis, parasite-surface components, and exocytosis, and only a 37% overlap between the two proliferative stages. In the presence of magnesium, there was a lower enrichment with the isolation of about 30 proteins with overrepresented candidates involved in tRNA amino acylation, phosphate homeostasis, lipid and glucose catabolism, and cell division, and 15% overlap between proliferative stages. To validate the pull-down results, we endogenously tagged four protein candidates and immunopurified them.

We address these limitations with PPM-Decay, a new variant of PPM that introduces a customizable memory decay kernel. In three studies - one with artificially generated sequences, one with chord sequences from Western music, and one with new behavioral data from an auditory pattern detection experiment - we show how this decay kernel improves the models predictive performance for sequences whose underlying statistics change over time, and enables the model to capture effects of memory constraints on auditory pattern detection.

While this process has been extensively studied in bulk assays, the dynamics of hijacking at the single-molecule level remain unexplored in living cells. To achieve this, we developed a bicistronic biosensor encoding complementary repeat epitopes in two ORFs, one translated in a Cap-dependent manner and the other translated in an IRES-mediated manner. Using a pair of complementary probes that bind the epitopes co-translationally, our biosensor lights up in different colors depending on which ORF is being translated. In combination with single-molecule tracking and computational modeling, we measured the relative kinetics of Cap versus IRES translation and show: (1) Two non-overlapping ORFs can be simultaneously translated within a single mRNA; (2) EMCV IRES-mediated translation sites recruit ribosomes less efficiently than Cap-dependent translation sites but are otherwise nearly indistinguishable, having similar mobilities, sizes, spatial distributions, and ribosomal initiation and elongation rates; (3) Both Cap-dependent and IRES-mediated ribosomes tend to stretch out translation sites; (4) Although the IRES recruits two to three times fewer ribosomes than the Cap in normal conditions, the balance shifts dramatically in favor of the IRES during oxidative and ER stresses that mimic viral infection; and (5) Translation of the IRES is enhanced by translation of the Cap, demonstrating upstream translation can positively impact the downstream translation of a non-overlapping ORF. With the ability to simultaneously quantify two distinct translation mechanisms in physiologically relevant live-cell environments, we anticipate bicistronic biosensors like the one we developed here will become powerful new tools to dissect both canonical and non-canonical translation dynamics with single-molecule precision.

The wide host range of the causative pestiviruses may lead to formation of virus reservoirs in other ruminant or wildlife species, presenting a concern for the long-term success of BVD eradication campaigns. It is likely that the quasispecies nature of these RNA viruses contributes to their interspecies transmission by providing genetic plasticity. Understanding the spectrum of sequence variants present in BVD persistently infected (PI) animals is therefore essential for studies of virus transmission. To analyse quasispecies diversity without amplification bias, we extracted viral RNA from serum of a PI cow, and from cell culture fluid after three passages of the same virus in culture, to produce cDNA without amplification. Sequencing of this material using Illumina 250bp paired-read technology produced full-length virus consensus sequences from both sources and demonstrated the quasispecies diversity of this Pestivirus A type 1a field strain within serum and after culture. We report the distribution and diversity of over 800 single nucleotide polymorphisms and provide evidence for a loss of diversity after only three passages in cell culture, implying that cultured viruses cannot be used to understand quasispecies diversity and may not provide reliable molecular markers for source tracing or transmission studies.

Additionally, both serum and cultured viruses could be sequenced as a set of 25 overlapping PCR amplicons that demonstrated the same consensus sequences and the presence of many of the same quasispecies variants. The observation that aspects of the quasispecies structure revealed by massively parallel sequencing are also detected after PCR and Sanger sequencing suggests that this approach may be useful for small or difficult to analyse samples.

Impact statementBovine viral diarrhoea viruses are globally important cattle pathogens, which impact performance due to acute infection and BVD-induced immunosuppression. Eradication of BVD in cattle is widely pursued but is hampered by the production of persistently infected (PI) calves - the offspring of cows infected in early pregnancy - which shed virus constantly and drive BVD spread. Genetic variation in BVD viruses is an important feature of their biology, allowing them to adapt to changing conditions and to infect different hosts. Inaccurate virus replication produces a population of viruses with slightly different sequences, a quasispecies, some of which may grow better in other hosts or in culture. Analysing virus sequence variation may help us understand how the virus evolves within and between its hosts. In this paper we show that a BVD virus strain loses quasispecies diversity quickly when cultured and that these changes can be detected even in small diagnostic samples, implying that cultured viruses do not perfectly represent the field strains they were isolated from and therefore may not provide reliable molecular markers for source tracing or transmission studies.

We describe the development of these genetic tools and their use for obtaining tumor cell lines with inducible neoantigen expression.

K.; Roseboom, W.","Warrick Roseboom","University of Sussex","2020-01-09",1,"cc_by_nc","new results","neuroscience","Human experience of time exhibits systematic, context-dependent deviations from objective clock time. For example, time is experienced differently at work than on holiday. The cognitive and neural bases of how time perception interacts with the content of experience remain unclear, and leading explanations of human time perception are not equipped to explain this interaction. We propose an alternative account of human time perception, based on the dynamics of sensory processing. Our approach naturally links content of experience with time perception through a common foundation in basic sensory processing. We provide evidence for this proposal in model-based analyses of the dynamics of perceptual processing in an artificial neural network and in the activity of human sensory cortex. Healthy human participants watched naturalistic, silent videos and estimated their duration while fMRI was acquired. The same videos were used as stimuli for the artificial network. We constructed a computational model that predicted video durations from salient events in the activity of the artificial network, or in participants visual cortex. The artificial network model reproduced human-like duration estimates, including biases in estimation depending on the content of a given video. Most importantly, the model based on human visual cortex activity reproduced trial-by-trial biases in our human participants subjective reports, whereas control models trained on auditory or somatosensory activity did not. Together, our results reveal that human subjective time is based on information arising during the processing of our dynamic sensory environment, providing a computational basis for an end-to-end account of time perception.

Significance StatementOur perception of time depends on the contents of experience, reflected in expressions such as ""a watched pot never boils"". Prevailing accounts of human time perception cannot provide good explanations for this. We tested a new explanation: time perception arises from the processing of our dynamic sensory environment. Supporting this theory, human participants duration reports of silent videos correlated with estimates we reconstructed from activity in the visual cortex of their brain while they watched those videos. This was not a brain-wide phenomenon; reconstructions based on other brain regions did not correlate with subjective reports of duration. Our results validate our new theory, linking content of experience and perception of time through a common foundation in basic sensory processing.","NA"

Yet, structural insight on the architecture and dynamics of these oligomeric Hsp40s will help explain their potent ability to suppress polyglutamine and other amyloid protein aggregation. Here, our combined in vitro, in vivo, and in silico studies shed new light on the supramolecular structure of the homooligomeric Hsp40 DnaJB8 and how it regulates recruitment of partner Hsp70s.

Recent NMR relaxation experiments revealed the transient presence of an alternative, Hoogsteen base pairing pattern in naked DNA duplexes and estimated its relative stability and lifetime. In contrast, HG transitions in RNA were not observed. Understanding Hoogsteen (HG) base pairing is important because the underlying ""breathing"" can modulate significantly DNA/RNA recognition by proteins. However, a detailed mechanistic insight into the transition pathways and kinetics is still missing. We performed enhanced sampling simulation (with combined metadynamics and adaptive force bias method) and Markov State modeling to obtain accurate free energy, kinetics and the intermediates in the transition pathway between WC and HG base pair for both naked B-DNA and A-RNA duplexes. The Markov state model constructed from our unbiased MD simulation data revealed previously unknown complex extra-helical intermediates in this seemingly simple process of base pair conformation switching in B-DNA. Extending our calculation to A-RNA, for which HG base pair is not observed experimentally, resulted in relatively unstable single hydrogen bonded distorted Hoogsteen like base pair. Unlike B-DNA the transition pathway primarily involved base paired and intra-helical intermediates with transition timescales much higher than that of B-DNA. The seemingly obvious flip-over reaction coordinate, i.e., the glycosidic torsion angle is unable to resolve the intermediates; so a multidimensional picture, involving backbone dihedral angles and distance between atoms participating in hydrogen bonds, is required to gain insight into the molecular mechanism.

SIGNIFICANCEFormation of unconventional Hoogsteen (HG) base pairing is an important problem in DNA biophysics owing to its key role in facilitating the binding of DNA repairing enzymes, proteins and drugs to damaged DNA. X-ray crystallography and NMR relaxation experiments revealed the presence of HG base pair in naked DNA duplex and protein-DNA complex but no HG base pair was observed in RNA. Molecular dynamics simulations could reproduce the experimental free energy cost of HG base pairing in DNA although a detailed mechanistic insight is still missing.

This presents an opportunity to study mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulatory control. In seeking the mechanisms behind this patterning, we discovered that some cell-specific mRNAs accumulate non-homogenously within cells, localizing to membranes, P granules (associated with progenitor germ cells in the P lineage), and P-bodies (associated with RNA processing). Transcripts differed in their dependence on 3UTRs and RNA Binding Proteins, suggesting diverse regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we found strong but imperfect correlations between low translational status and P granule localization within the progenitor germ lineage. By uncoupling these, we untangled a long-standing question: Are mRNAs directed to P granules for translational repression or do they accumulate there as a downstream step? We found translational repression preceded P granule localization and could occur independent of it. Further, disruption of translation was sufficient to send homogenously distributed mRNAs to P granules. Overall, we show transcripts important for germline development are directed to P granules by translational repression, and this, in turn, directs their accumulation in the progenitor germ lineage where their repression can ultimately be relieved.

While the mechanism of galectin-3 secretion is unclear, studies have shown that the mutation of a highly conserved arginine to a serine in human galectin-3 (LGALS3-R186S) blocks glycan binding and secretion. To gain insight into the roles of extracellular and intracellular functions of galectin-3, we generated mice with the equivalent mutation (Lgals3-R200S) using CRISPR/Cas9-directed homologous recombination. Consistent with a reduction in galectin-3 secretion, we observed significantly reduced galectin-3 protein levels in the plasma of heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice. We observed a similar increased bone mass phenotype in Lgals3-R200S mutant mice at 36 weeks as we previously observed in Lgals3-KO mice with slight variation. Like Lgals3-KO mice, Lgals3-R200S females, but not males, had significantly increased trabecular bone mass. However, only male Lgals3-R200S mice showed increased cortical bone expansion, which we had previously observed in both male and female Lgals3-KO mice and only in female mice using a separate Lgals3 null allele (Lgals3). These results suggest that the trabecular bone phenotype of Lgals3-KO mice was driven primarily by loss of extracellular galectin-3. However, the cortical bone phenotype of Lgals3-KO mice may have also been influenced by loss of intracellular galectin-3. Future analyses of these mice will aid in identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the Lgals3-deficient bone phenotype as well as aid in distinguishing the extracellular vs. intracellular roles of galectin-3 in various signaling pathways.","NA"

Here, we develop game theoretical models to explore how the timing of contributions evolves. We show how contributing rapidly is not necessarily optimal, since delayers can act as ""cheats,"" avoiding contributing while reaping the benefits of the public good. However, delaying too long can put the delayers at a disadvantage as they can miss out on the benefits.

Epigenetics has been implicated in phenomena as diverse as development, stress response and carcinogenesis. A significant challenge facing those interested in investigating epigenetic phenomena is determining causal relationships between DNA methylation, specific classes of small RNAs and associated changes in gene expression. Because they are the primary targets of epigenetic silencing in plants and, when active, are often targeted for de novo silencing, transposable elements (TEs) represent a valuable source of information about these relationships. We use a naturally occurring system in which a single TE can be heritably silenced by a single derivative of that TE. By using this system it is possible to unravel causal relationships between different size classes of small RNAs, patterns of DNA methylation and heritable silencing. Here, we show that the long terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) within Zea mays MuDR transposons are targeted by distinct classes of small RNAs during epigenetic silencing that are dependent on distinct silencing pathways. Further, these small RNAs target distinct regions of the TIRs, resulting in different patterns of cytosine methylation with different functional consequences with respect to epigenetic silencing and heritability of that silencing.

SummaryTransposable elements (TEs) are a ubiquitous feature of plant genomes. Because of the threat they post to genome integrity, most TEs are epigenetically silenced. However, even closely related plant species often have dramatically different populations of TEs, suggesting periodic rounds of activity and silencing. Here we show that the process of de novo methylation of an active element in maize involves two distinct pathways, one of which is directly implicated in causing epigenetic silencing and one of which is the result of that silencing.","10.1534/genetics.120.303033"

APDT provided with a near infrared (NIR) light in conjunction with an indocyanine green (ICG) photosensitizer has shown efficacy in several dental in-office-treatment protocols. In this study, we tested Streptococcus mutans biofilm sensitivity to either single-light (aPDT or aBL) or dual-light aPDT (simultaneous aPDT and aBL) exposure.

Materials and MethodsBiofilm was cultured by pipeting diluted Streptococcus mutans suspension with growth medium on the bottom of well plates. Either a single-light aPDT (810-nm aPDT or 405-nm aBL) or a dual-light aPDT (simultaneous 810-nm aPDT and 405nm aBL) was applied, in both cases together with the ICG photosensitizer, while keeping the total light energy constant at 100J/cm2. Single-dose light exposures were given after one-day, four-day or fourteen-day biofilm incubations. Also, a repeated daily dose of the same light energy was applied during biofilm incubations on four-day and fourteen-day biofilms. Finally, antibacterial action of the dual-light aPDT with different relative ratios of 810 nm and 405 nm of light energy was examined on the single-day and four-day protocols. Biofilms were scraped, diluted into ratios between 1:1 to 1:100 000, and plated. After re-incubation, colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted, and confocal 3D biofilm imaging was performed.

ResultsOn a one-day biofilm, dual-light aPDT was significantly more efficient than single-light aBL or aPDT, although all modalities were bactericidal. On a four-day maturated biofilm, a single exposure of aPDT or dual-light aPDT was more efficient than aBL, resulting in a four logarithmic scale reduction in bacterial counts. Surprisingly, when the same amount of aPDT was repeated with a daily dosing on a four-day or a fourteen-day biofilm, bacterial viability improved significantly. A similar but milder response of improved bacterial viability was seen after repetitive aBL application. The viability improvement was eliminated when dual-light aPDT was applied. By changing the relative light energy ratios in dual-light aPDT, a relative increase in aBL improved the antibacterial action of dual-light aPDT when the biofilm was older.

ConclusionWhen aPDT is administered repeatedly to S. mutans biofilm, a single wavelength-based aBL or aPDT leads to a significant biofilm adaptation and increased S. mutans viability. The combined use of aBL light in synchrony with aPDT arrests the adaptation and provides significantly improved and sustained antibacterial efficacy.","NA"

There is limited knowledge as to how P. aeruginosa senses, responds to, and survives attack from HOCl and HOSCN, and the contribution of such responses to its success as a CF pathogen. We investigated the P. aeruginosa response to these oxidants by screening 707 transposon mutants, with mutations in regulatory genes, for altered growth following HOCl exposure. We identified regulators involved in antibiotic resistance, methionine biosynthesis and catabolite repression, and PA14_07340, the homologue of the Escherichia coli HOCl-sensor RclR (30% identical), that were required for HOCl survival. We have shown that RclR (PA14_07340) protects specifically against HOCl and HOSCN stress, and responds to both oxidants by upregulating expression of a putative peroxiredoxin, rclX (PA14_07355). While there was specificity in the transcriptional response to HOCl (231 genes upregulated) and HOSCN (105 genes upregulated) there was considerable overlap, with 74 genes upregulated by both oxidants. These included genes encoding the type III secretion system (T3SS), sulphur and taurine transport, and the MexEF-OprN efflux pump. RclR coordinated the transcriptional response to HOCl and HOSCN, including upregulation of pyocyanin biosynthesis genes, and in response to HOSCN alone RclR downregulated chaperone genes.

The present methodology requires a well-annotated reference genome, for which the identification of the parental subgenome fragments has been performed (e.g. Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea). Focusing on fully retained genes (i.e. genes for which all homoeologous gene copies inherited from the parental lineages are still present in the reference genome), the method constructs multi-labelled gene trees that allow subsequent assignment of each gene copy to its diploid parental lineage. Once the orthologous copies are identified, genes from the same parental origin are concatenated and tree-building methods are used to reconstruct the species tree. This method allows resolving the phylogenetic relationships (i) among extant species within a mesopolyploid clade, (ii) among the parental lineages of a mesopolyploid lineage, and (iii) between the parental lineages and closely related extant species. We report here the first well-resolved nuclear-based phylogeny of the Brassiceae tribe.","NA"

Together with MinC and MinE, the Min system restricts assembly of the FtsZ-ring to midcell, oscillating between the opposite ends of the cell and preventing FtsZ-ring misassembly at the poles. Here, we show that the ATP-dependent bacterial proteasome complex ClpXP degrades MinD in reconstituted degradation reactions in vitro, through direct recognition of the MinD N-terminal region, and in vivo. MinD degradation is enhanced during stationary phase, suggesting that ClpXP regulates levels of MinD in cells that are not actively dividing. MinC and MinD are known to co-assemble into linear polymers, therefore we monitored copolymers assembled in vitro after incubation with ClpXP and observed that ClpXP promotes rapid MinCD copolymer disassembly as a result of direct MinD degradation by ClpXP. The N-terminus of MinD, including residue Arg 3, which is near the ATP-binding site, is critical for degradation by ClpXP. Together, these results demonstrate that ClpXP degradation modifies conformational assemblies of MinD in vitro and depresses Min function in vivo during periods of reduced proliferation.","NA"

However, the mechanisms coupling circadian rhythms and metabolism remain poorly understood. Here we report that Cystathionine {beta}-synthase (CBS), a central enzyme in one-carbon metabolism, functionally interacts with the core circadian protein Cryptochrome1 (CRY1). In cells, CBS augments CRY1 mediated repression of the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex and shortens circadian period. Notably, we find that mutant CBS-I278T protein, the most common cause of homocystinuria, does not bind CRY1 or regulate its repressor activity. Transgenic CbsZn/Zn mice, while maintaining circadian locomotor activity period, exhibit reduced circadian power and increased expression of E-BOX outputs. CBS function is reciprocally influenced by CRY1 binding. CRY1 modulates enzymatic activity of the CBS. Liver extracts from Cry1-/- mice show reduced CBS activity that normalizes after the addition of exogenous wild type (WT) CRY1. Metabolomic analysis of WT, CbsZn/Zn, Cry1-/-, and Cry2-/- samples highlights the metabolic importance of endogenous CRY1.

We describe a dense supercolony-like aggregation of more than 1 300 nests of the ant Formica (Coptoformica) pressilabris. We performed aggression bioassays and found that, while aggression levels were generally low, there was some aggression within the assumed supercolony. The occurrence of aggression increased with distance from the focal nest, in accordance with the genetically viscous population structure we observe by using 10 microsatellite markers. However, the aggressive interactions do not follow any clear pattern that would allow specifying colony borders within the area.

Dysregulation of these adhesion molecules have been genetically and functionally linked to various neurological disorders. Here we investigated the molecular structure and mechanism of ligand interactions for the postsynaptic SALM3 adhesion protein with its presynaptic ligand, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase {sigma} (PTP{sigma}). We solved the crystal structure of the dimerized leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain of SALM3, revealing the conserved structural features and mechanism of dimerization. Furthermore, we determined the complex structure of SALM3 with PTP{sigma} using small angle X-ray scattering, revealing a 2:2 complex similar to that observed for SALM5. Solution studies unraveled additional flexibility for the complex structure, but validated the uniform mode of action for SALM3 and SALM5 to promote synapse formation. The relevance of the key interface residues was further confirmed by mutational analysis with cellular binding assays and artificial synapse formation assays. Collectively, our results suggest that SALM3 dimerization is a pre-requisite for the SALM3-PTP{sigma} complex to exert synaptogenic activity.","NA"

Using the fusion marker myomaker, named TMEM8C in chicken, we found that both TMEM8C transcripts and the differentiated and fusion-competent MYOG+ cells are preferentially regionalized in the central regions of limb foetal muscles in chicken embryos. Because the NOTCH signalling pathway is a potent inhibitor of muscle differentiation during developmental myogenesis, NOTCH function in myoblast fusion was not addressed so far. We analysed the consequences of NOTCH inhibition for myoblast fusion and TMEM8C expression during foetal myogenesis using in vitro and in vivo chicken systems. NOTCH inhibition following chicken embryo immobilisation or in myoblast cultures increased TMEM8C expression and myoblast fusion. Moreover, we showed that NOTCH inhibition induced the un-binding of the HEYL transcriptional repressor from the TMEM8C regulatory regions in limb muscles and myoblast cultures.

To extend the advantages of MPPs in budding yeast, we describe the creation and characterization of two outbred MPPs derived from eighteen genetically diverse founding strains. We carried out de novo assemblies of the genomes of the eighteen founder strains, such that virtually all variation segregating between these strains is known and represent those assemblies as Santa Cruz Genome Browser tracks. We discover complex patterns of structural variation segregating amongst the founders, including a large deletion within the vacuolar ATPase VMA1, several different deletions within the osmosensor MSB2, a series of deletions and insertions at PRM7 and the adjacent BSC1, as well as copy number variation at the dehydrogenase ALD2. Resequenced haploid recombinant clones from the two MPPs have a median unrecombined block size of 66kb, demonstrating the population are highly recombined. We pool sequenced the two MPPs to 3270X and 2226X coverage and demonstrate that we can accurately estimate local haplotype frequencies using pooled data. We further down-sampled the poolseq data to ~20-40X and show that local haplotype frequency estimates remain accurate, with median error rate 0.8% and 0.6% at 20X and 40X, respectively. Haplotypes frequencies are estimated much more accurately than SNP frequencies obtained directly from the same data.

However, atmospheric nutrient deposition can affect plant-microbe relationships by changing soil bacterial composition and by reducing cooperation between microbial taxa and plants. To examine how long-term nutrient addition shapes rhizosphere community composition, we compared traits associated with bacterial (fast growing copiotrophs, slow-growing oligotrophs) and plant (C3 forb, C4 grass) communities residing in a nutrient poor wetland ecosystem. Results revealed that oligotrophic taxa dominated soil bacterial communities and that fertilization increased the presence of oligotrophs in bulk and rhizosphere communities. Additionally, bacterial species diversity was greatest in fertilized soils, particularly in bulk soils. Nutrient enrichment (fertilized vs. unfertilized) and plant association (bulk vs. rhizosphere) determined bacterial community composition; bacterial community structure associated with plant functional group (grass vs. forb) was similar within treatments but differed between fertilization treatments. The core forb microbiome consisted of 602 unique taxa and the core grass microbiome consisted of 372 unique taxa. Forb rhizospheres were enriched in potentially disease suppressive bacterial taxa and grass rhizospheres were enriched in bacterial taxa associated with complex carbon decomposition. Results from this study demonstrate that fertilization serves as a strong environmental filter on the soil microbiome, which leads to distinct rhizosphere communities and can shift plants influence on the rhizosphere microbiome. These taxonomic shifts within plant rhizospheres could have implications for plant health and ecosystem functions involving carbon and nitrogen cycles.

ImportanceOver the last century, humans have substantially altered nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. Use of synthetic fertilizer and burning of fossil fuels and biomass have increased nitrogen and phosphorous deposition, which results in unintended fertilization of historically low-nutrient ecosystems. With increased nutrient availability, plant biodiversity is expected to decline and bacterial communities are anticipated to increase in abundance of copiotrophic taxa. Here, we address how bacterial communities associated with different plant functional types (forb, grass) shift due to long-term nutrient enrichment. Unlike other studies, results revealed an increase in bacterial diversity, particularly, of oligotrophic bacteria in fertilized plots. We observed that nutrient addition strongly determines forb and grass rhizosphere composition, which could indicate different metabolic preferences in the bacterial communities. This study highlights how long-term fertilization of oligotroph-dominated wetlands could alter the metabolism of rhizosphere bacterial communities in unexpected ways.","NA"

It is therefore considered as a promising method for cognitive enhancement and rehabilitation. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of tRNS are poorly understood, mainly due to difficulties in separating neural signal from stimulation artefact. Here we suggest a procedure to successfully remove the tRNS artefact in both the time and frequency domains, leading to electroencephalography (EEG) data that are comparable between participants in active and sham (placebo) tRNS conditions. Such a procedure affords us a unique opportunity to examine the neurophysiological mechanisms that are altered by tRNS during complex mental arithmetic. We recorded EEG data in 69 participants who received arithmetic training concurrently with active or sham tRNS above the dlPFC. We successfully found that active tRNS improved arithmetic performance compared to sham tRNS. The underlying event-related potentials revealed that the tRNS effect was associated with increases in components that are associated with domain-general, rather than domain-specific, changes as indicated by alteration in amplitude of attention and preparatory markers. The results indicate that the enhancement effect of tRNS when applied above the dlPFC acts by effecting general attentional mechanisms during cognitive training, which explains the potential improvement seen over a large array of cognitive tasks. In addition, our procedure to remove the tRNS artefact effectively allows future investigation of the mechanisms underlying the effect of tRNS on human behaviour.","NA"

This allows us to directly compare a variety of segmentation and training approaches on identical cells. This approach revealed that fluorescence-based strategies generally provide higher segmentation accuracies, but dipped below label-free models when labeling was inconsistent. The relative strengths of label and label-free techniques could be combined through the use of merging fluorescence channels and using out-of-focus brightfield images. Beyond comparing segmentation strategies, using subimage stacks for training was also found to provide a method of simulating a wide range of labeling conditions during training, increasing the ability of the final model to accomodate a fuller range of experimental setups.","NA"

In total, 40 fish per family (15 fish intraperitoneally injected and 25 fish as cohabitants) were selected for the challenge test and mortalities recorded every 3 hours, until no mortalities occurred for a period of 3 consecutive days. Genotypes (50,690 SNPs) and phenotypes (0 for dead and 1 for alive) for 2472 cohabitant fish were available. The pedigree-based analysis utilized a deep pedigree, going 17 generations back in time. Genetic parameters were obtained using various genomic selection models (GBLUP, BayesB, BayesC, BayesR and BayesS) and traditional pedigree-based model (PBLUP). The genomic models were further analyzed using 10 different subsets of SNP-densities for optimum marker density selection.

This study aimed to identify the effect of short-term high intensity exercise on the proteome of the rat ACL and MCL using mass spectrometry. Sprague Dawley male rats (n=12) were split into equal groups of control and exercise animals, which were subjected to high intensity training and followed by proteomic analysis of the ACL and MCL. Knee joint and ligament health was assessed using OARSI scoring or using a validated histological scoring system. Histopathological analyses demonstrated no significant changes in the ACL, MCL or cartilage of the knee joint, indicating that the exercise regime used in this study did not have substantial impact on tissue structure and health of several tissues within the rat knee joint. Some proteins were found to be significantly more abundant in the ACL in the exercised group than the control group. However, no proteins with a significantly different expression were identified between MCL control and MCL exercised groups. The majority of proteins expressed at higher levels in the ACL exercise group were cytoskeletal proteins, ribosomal proteins and enzymes.

We asked whether a neural reinforcement learning signal, the feedback related negativity (FRN), is modulated not only by reward outcomes but also physical effort. We recorded EEG from human participants while they performed a task in which they were required to accurately produce target levels of muscle activation to receive rewards. Participants performed isometric knee extensions while quadriceps muscle activation was recorded using EMG. Real-time feedback indicated muscle activation relative to a target. On a given trial, the target muscle activation required either low or high effort. The effort was determined probabilistically according to a binary choice, such that the responses were associated with 20% and 80% probability of high effort. This contingency could only be known by experience, and it reversed periodically. After each trial binary reinforcement feedback was provided to indicate whether participants were sufficiently accurate in producing the target muscle activity. Participants adaptively avoided effort by switching responses more frequently after choices that resulted in hard effort. Feedback after participants choices which revealed the resulting effort requirement for the subsequent knee extension did not elicit an FRN component. However, the neural response to reinforcement feedback after the knee extension was increased during and after the time period of the FRN by preceding physical effort. Thus, retrospective effort modulates reward processing which may underlie paradoxical behavioral findings whereby rewards requiring more effort to obtain can become more powerful reinforcers.

Significance StatementWhen making decisions, we typically select more rewarding and less effortful options. Neural reinforcement learning signals reinforce rewarding actions and deter punishing actions. When participants received feedback that their choices would require easy or hard physical effort, we did not observe reinforcement learning signals that are typically observed in response to feedback predicting reward and punishment. Thus, the reinforcement learning system does not strictly treat effort as loss or punishment. However, when the effort was completed and participants received feedback indicating whether they successfully achieved a reward or not, reinforcement learning signals were amplified by preceding effort. Thus, retrospective effort can affect neural responses to reinforcement outcomes, which may explain how effort can enhance the motivational effect of reinforcers.","NA"

Weiss","Albert Einstein College of Medicine","2020-01-09",1,"cc_by_nd","new results","microbiology","The ubiquitous parasite Toxoplasma gondii exhibits an impressive ability to maintain a chronic infection of its host for prolonged periods. Despite this, little is known regarding if and how T. gondii bradyzoites, a quasi-dormant life-stage residing within intracellular cysts, manipulate the host cell so as to maintain a persistent infection. A previous proteomic study of the cyst wall, an amorphous layer of proteins that forms underneath the cyst membrane, identified MYR1 as a putative cyst wall protein in vitro. As MYR1 is known to be involved in the translocation of parasite derived effector proteins into the host cell, we sought to determine whether parasites transitioning toward the bradyzoite life stage retain the capacity to translocate proteins via this pathway. By epitope tagging the endogenous loci of four known effectors that translocate from the parasitophorous vacuole into the host cell nucleus, we show by immunofluorescence that most effectors accumulate in the host nucleus at early but not late timepoints post-infection during the tachyzoite to bradyzoite transition and when parasites farther along the bradyzoite differentiation continuum invade a new host cell. We demonstrate that the suppression of interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) signaling, previously shown to be mediated by the effector TgIST, also occurs in the context of prolonged infection with bradyzoites, and that TgIST export is a process that occurs beyond the early stages of host cell infection. These findings have important implications as to how this highly successful parasite maintains a persistent infection of its host.

IMPORTANCEToxoplasma bradyzoites persist within tissue cysts and are refractory to current treatments, serving as a reservoir for acute complications in settings of compromised immunity. Much remains to be understood regarding how this life-stage successfully establishes and maintains a persistent infection. In this study, we investigated whether the export of parasite effector proteins into the host cell occurs during the development of in vitro tissue cysts. We quantified the presence of four previously described effectors in host cell nuclei at different timepoints post-bradyzoite differentiation and found that they accumulate largely during the early stages of infection. Despite a decline in nuclear accumulation, we found that one of these effectors still mediates its function after prolonged infection with bradyzoites and provide evidence that this effector is exported beyond early infection stages. These findings suggest that effector export from within developing tissue cysts provides one potential mechanism by which this parasite achieves chronic infection.","10.1128/mBio.00046-20"

Using multivariate analyses to decode stimulus presence and identity, we found that information regarding stimulus presence and modal identity were found in both S1 and PMv and extended beyond the duration of significant evoked spiking activity, and that this information followed different time-courses in these two areas. Further, we combined time-generalization decoding with cross-area decoding to demonstrate that while signaling the presence of a stimulus involves a feedforward-feedback coupling between S1-PMv, the processing of modal identity is largely restricted to S1. Together, these results highlight the differing spatiotemporal dynamics of information flow regarding stimulus presence and modal identity in two nodes of an important cortical sensorimotor circuit.

Significance StatementIt is unclear how the structure and function of the brain support differing sensory functions, such as detecting the presence of a stimulus in the environment vs. identifying it. Here, we used multivariate decoding methods on monkey neuronal data to track how information regarding stimulus presence and modal identity flow within a sensorimotor circuit. Results demonstrate that while neural patterns in both primary somatosensory (S1) and ventral pre-motor (PMv) cortices can be used to detect and discriminate between stimuli, they follow different time-courses. Importantly, findings suggest that while information regarding the presence of a stimulus flows reciprocally between S1 and PMv, information regarding stimulus identity is largely contained in S1.","NA"

They are caused by inherited or de novo mutations in over 350 nuclear-encoded and mtDNA-encoded genes. There is no approved treatment to stop the progression of any mitochondrial disease despite the enormous global unmet need. Affected families often self-compound cocktails of over-the-counter vitamins and generally recognized as safe nutritional supplements that have not received regulatory approval for efficacy. Finding a new use for an approved drug is called repurposing, an attractive path for mitochondrial diseases because of the reduced safety risks, low costs and fast timelines to a clinic-ready therapy or combination of therapies. Here I describe the first-ever drug repurposing screen for mitochondrial diseases involving complex I deficiency, e.g., Leigh syndrome, using the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as a model system. Unlike the more commonly used yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae but like humans, Yarrowia lipolytica has a functional and metabolically integrated respiratory complex I and is an obligate aerobe. In 384-well-plate liquid culture format without shaking, Yarrowia lipolytica cells grown in either glucose-containing media or acetate-containing media were treated with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (3{micro}M and 6M, respectively) of the natural product and complex I inhibitor piericidin A. Out of 2,560 compounds in the Microsource Spectrum collection, 24 suppressors of piercidin A reached statistical significance in one or both media conditions. The suppressors include calcium channel blockers nisoldipine, amiodarone and tetrandrine as well as the farnesol-like sesquiterpenoids parthenolide, nerolidol and bisabolol, which may all be modulating mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. Estradiols and synthetic estrogen receptor agonists are the largest class of suppressors that rescue growth of piericidin-A-treated Yarrowia lipolytica cells in both glucose-containing and acetate-containing media. Analysis of structure-activity relationships suggests that estrogens may enhance bioenergetics by evolutionarily conserved interactions with mitochondrial membranes that promote mitochondrial filamentation and mitochondrial DNA replication.","NA"

PAR-2 is normally expressed basolaterally in differentiated nasal ciliated cells.

ObjectiveWe tested if epithelial remodeling during diseases characterized by loss of cilia and squamous metaplasia may alter PAR-2 polarization.

MethodsEndogenous PAR-2 responses were measured by live cell calcium and cilia imaging, measurement of fluid secretion, and quantification of cytokines. We utilized airway squamous cell lines, primary differentiated air-liquid interface cultures, and tissue explants. Cells were exposed to disease-related modifiers that alter epithelial morphology, including IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, and retinoic acid deficiency. We used concentrations and exposure times that altered epithelial morphology without causing breakdown of the epithelial barrier, likely reflecting early disease states.

ResultsPAR-2 signaling in airway squamous cells activated calcium and inflammatory responses. Squamous cells cultured at air liquid interface (ALI) responded to PAR-2 agonists applied both apically and basolaterally. Primary well-differentiated nasal epithelial ALI cultures responded only to basolateral PAR-2 stimulation. Primary cultures exposed to IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, or reduced retinoic acid responded to both apical and basolateral PAR-2 stimulation. Nasal polyp tissue, but not control middle turbinate, exhibited apical calcium responses to PAR-2 stimulation. However, isolated ciliated cells from both polyp and turbinate maintained basolateral PAR-2 polarization.

ConclusionsSquamous metaplasia and/or loss of cilia enhances apical PAR-2 responses. Altered PAR-2 polarization in dedifferentiated or remodeled epithelia may contribute to increased sensitivity to inhaled protease allergens in inflammatory airway diseases.","NA"

Variants were filtered on the basis of population frequency, concordance between pairs of cousins, affecting a gene associated with osteoporosis, and likelihood to have functionally damaging, pathogenic consequences. Subsequently variants were tested for segregation in 68 additional relatives of the index carriers. A rare variant in MEGF6 (rs755467862) showed strong evidence of segregation with the disease phenotype. Predicted protein folding indicated the variant (Cys200Tyr) may disrupt structure of an EGF-like calcium-binding domain of MEGF6. Functional analyses demonstrated that complete loss of the paralogous genes megf6a and megf6b in zebrafish resulted in significant delay of cartilage and bone formation.

Having monitored the activities of >1,000 marketed drugs on 38 representative species of the healthy human gut microbiome4, we here characterize further the 144 antibiotics therein, representing all major classes. We determined >800 Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) and extended the antibiotic profiling to 10 additional species to validate these results and link to available data on antibiotic breakpoints for gut microbes. Antibiotic classes exhibited distinct inhibition spectra, including generation-dependent effects by quinolones and phylogeny-independence by {beta}-lactams. Macrolides and tetracyclines, two prototypic classes of bacteriostatic protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibited almost all commensals tested. We established that both kill different subsets of prevalent commensal bacteria, and cause cell lysis in specific cases. This species-specific activity challenges the long-standing divide of antibiotics into bactericidal and bacteriostatic, and provides a possible explanation for the strong impact of macrolides on the gut microbiota composition in animals5-8 and humans9-11. To mitigate the collateral damage of macrolides and tetracyclines on gut commensals, we exploited the fact that drug combinations have species-specific outcomes in bacteria12 and sought marketed drugs, which could antagonize the activity of these antibiotics in abundant gut commensal species. By screening >1,000 drugs, we identified several such antidotes capable of protecting gut species from these antibiotics without compromising their activity against relevant pathogens. Altogether, this study broadens our understanding of antibiotic action on gut commensals, uncovers a previously unappreciated and broad bactericidal effect of prototypical bacteriostatic antibiotics on gut bacteria, and opens avenues for preventing the collateral damage caused by antibiotics on human gut commensals.","NA"

In this temporary, therapy-tolerant state, cancer cells are highly sensitive to ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death that is caused by oxidative stress through excess levels of iron-dependent peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). However, mechanisms underpinning therapy-induced ferroptosis hypersensitivity remain to be elucidated.

MethodsWe used quantitative single cell imaging of fluorescent metabolic probes, transcriptomics, proteomics and lipidomics to perform a longitudinal analysis of the adaptive response to androgen receptor-targeted therapies (androgen deprivation and enzalutamide) in prostate cancer (PCa).

ResultsWe discovered that cessation of cell proliferation and a robust reduction in bioenergetic processes were associated with multidrug tolerance and a strong accumulation of lipids. The gain in lipid biomass was fueled by enhanced lipid uptake through cargo non-selective (macropinocytosis, tunneling nanotubes) and cargo-selective mechanisms (lipid transporters), whereas de novo lipid synthesis was strongly reduced. Enzalutamide induced extensive lipid remodeling of all major phospholipid classes at the expense of storage lipids, leading to increased desaturation and acyl chain length of membrane lipids. The rise in membrane PUFA levels enhanced membrane fluidity and lipid peroxidation, causing hypersensitivity to glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) inhibition and ferroptosis. Combination treatments against AR and fatty acid desaturation, lipase activities or growth medium supplementation with antioxidants or PUFAs altered GPX4 dependence. Despite multidrug tolerance, PCa cells displayed an enhanced sensitivity to inhibition of lysosomal processing of exogenous lipids, highlighting an increased dependence on lipid uptake in the therapy-tolerant state.

ConclusionsOur work provides mechanistic insight into processes of lipid metabolism that underpin the acquisition of therapy-induced GPX4 dependence and ferroptosis hypersensitivity to standard of care therapies in PCa. It demonstrated novel strategies to suppress the therapy-tolerant state that may have potential to delay and combat resistance to androgen receptor-targeted therapies, a currently unmet clinical challenge of advanced PCa. Since enhanced GPX4 dependence is an adaptive phenotype shared by several types of cancer in response to different therapies, our work might have universal implications for our understanding of metabolic events that underpin resistance to cancer therapies.","NA"

Loss of ADAM17, TNF and the TNF receptor Grindelwald in pigmented glial cells of the Drosophila retina leads to age related degeneration of both glia and neurons, preceded by an abnormal accumulation of glial LDs. We show that the glial LDs initially buffer the cells against damage caused by neuronally generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), but that in later life the LDs dissipate, leading to the release of toxic peroxidated lipids. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of a conserved pathway in human iPS-derived microglia-like cells, which are central players in neurodegeneration. Overall, we have discovered a pathway mediated by TNF signalling acting not as a trigger of inflammation, but as a cytoprotective factor in the retina.","NA"

In this study, we establish RAV1 as a master transcriptional regulator of defense genes in model plant Arabidopsis. The overexpression of AtRAV1 provided disease resistance against necrotrophic fungal pathogen (Rhizoctonia solani) infection in A. thaliana. The transgenic lines exhibited enhanced expression of several defense genes including mitogen associated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the amplitude of their expression was further enhanced upon pathogen infection. Conversely, the atrav1 mutant plants were unable to induce the expression of these defense genes and were highly susceptible to infection. Our data suggests that upon pathogen attack, AtRAV1 transcriptionally upregulate the expression of MAPKs (AtMPK3, AtMPK4 and AtMPK6) and AtMPK3 and AtMPK6 are essential for AtRAV1 mediated disease resistance. Further, we demonstrate that AtRAV1 is a phosphorylation target of AtMPK3 (but not AtMPK6) and the phospho-defective variants of AtRAV1 are unable to induce disease resistance in A. thaliana. Considering the presence of AtRAV1 orthologs in diverse plant species, we propose that they can be gainfully deployed to control economically important diseases.

Several software pipelines comprehensively solve this task in an automated manner for standard use-cases. However, simulations for non-standard applications such as uncommon electrode shapes or the creation of head models from non-optimized T1-weighted imaging data and the inclusion of irregular structures are more difficult to accomplish.

We address these limitations and suggest a comprehensive workflow to simulate transcranial electric stimulation based on open-source tools. The workflow covers the head model creation from MRI data, the electrode modeling, the modeling of anisotropic conductivity behavior of the white matter, the numerical simulation and visualization.

Skin, skull, air cavities, cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and gray matter are segmented semi-automatically from T1-weighted MR images. Electrodes of arbitrary number and shape can be modeled. The meshing of the head model is implemented in a way to preserve feature edges of the electrodes and is free of topological restrictions of the considered structures of the head model. White matter anisotropy can be computed from diffusion-tensor imaging data.

Our solver application was verified analytically and by contrasting tDCS simulation results with another simulation pipeline (SimNIBS 3.0). An agreement in both cases underlines the validity of our workflow.

Our suggested solutions facilitate investigations of irregular structures in patients (e.g. lesions, implants) or of new electrode types. For a coupled use of the described workflow, we provide documentation and disclose the full source code of the developed tools.","NA"

We investigated QS amongst heterogeneously distributed microbial aggregates under various flow conditions using a process-driven numerical model. Model simulations assess the conditions suitable for QS induction and quantify the importance of advective transport of signaling molecules. In addition, advection dilutes signaling molecules so that faster flow conditions require higher microbial densities, faster signal production rates, or higher sensitivities to signaling molecules to induce QS. However, autoinduction of signal production can substantially increase the transport distance of signaling molecules in both upstream and downstream directions. We present approximate analytical solutions of the advection-diffusion-reaction equation that describe the concentration profiles of signaling molecules for a wide range of flow and reaction rates. These empirical relationships, which predict the distribution of dissolved solutes following zero-order production kinetics along pore channels, allow to quantitatively estimate the effective communication distances amongst multiple microbial aggregates without further numerical simulations.

Author SummaryMicrobes can interact with their surrounding environments by producing and sensing small signaling molecules. When the microbes experience a high enough concentration of the signaling molecules, they express certain phenotypes which is often energetically expensive. This microbial decision-making process known as quorum sensing (QS) has been understood to confer evolutionary benefits. However, it is still not completely understood how transport of the produced signaling molecules affects QS. Using a mathematical approach investigating QS across a range of environmentally relevant flow conditions, we find that advective transport promotes QS downstream yet also dilutes the concentration of signaling molecules. We quantify the importance of microbial cell location with respect to both other microbes and flow direction. By analyzing complex numerical simulation results, we provide analytical approximations to assess the distribution of signaling molecules in pore channels across a range of flow and reaction conditions.","NA"

All patients completed a questionnaire concerning their current disease. Serum amylase (S-Amyl) and C-reactive protein (S-CRP) levels, tonsillar findings, and pus aspirate samples and throat cultures were analyzed. Eight of 58 PTA patients (13.8%) had no signs of tonsillar infection. The absence of tonsillar erythema and exudate was associated with low S-CRP (p<0.001) and older age (p<0.001). We also observed an inverse correlation between S-Amyl and S-CRP levels (AT, r= -0.519; PTA, r= -0.353). Therefore, we observed a group of PTA patients without signs of tonsillar infection who had significantly lower S-CRP levels than other PTA patients. These findings support that PTA may be caused by an etiology other than AT. Variations in the S-Amyl levels and a negative correlation between S-Amyl and S-CRP levels may indicate that minor salivary glands are involved in PTA development.

In order to inform future developments, it is important to understand the benefits and impact of prescribing by allied health professionals including physiotherapists and podiatrists.

Aim: to compare outcomes of Physiotherapist and Podiatrist Independent Prescriber (PP-IP) patients with those of Physiotherapist and Podiatrist non-prescribers (PP-NPs). Outcome measures included patient satisfaction, ease of access to services, quality of life and cost implications.

Design: a quasi-experimental, post-test control group design

Methods: Using mixed methods outcomes were compared between 7 sites where care was provided from a PP-IP (3 podiatrist and 4 physiotherapist IPs) and 7 sites from a PP-NP (3 podiatrist and 4 physiotherapist NPs). Patients were followed up for 2 months (2015-2016).

Results: 489 patients were recruited: n=243 IP sites, and n=246 NP sites. Independent prescribing was found to be highly acceptable, and equivalent in terms of quality of life (p>0.05) and patient satisfaction (p[&le;]0.05) compared to care provided by NPs. PP-IP care delivery was found to be more resource intensive than NP-PP, with longer consultation duration for IPs (around 6.5 mins), and a higher proportion of physiotherapy patients discussed with medical colleagues (around 9.5 minutes).

ConclusionThis study provides new knowledge that PP-IPs provide high levels of care. PP-IP care delivery was found to be more resource intensive. Further research is required to explore cost effectiveness. A more focussed exploration within each profession using targeted outcome measures would enable a more robust comparison, inform future developments around the world and help ensure non-doctor prescribing is recognised as an effective way to alleviate shortfalls in the global workforce.","NA"

In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was developed for simple, rapid and on-site detection of M. partityla in infested plant roots and validated to detect the nematode in laboratory and field conditions. Specific primers were designed based on the sequence distinction of internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-18S/5.8S ribosomal RNA gene between M. partityla and other Meloidogyne spp. The LAMP detection technique could detect the presence of M. partityla genomic DNA at a concentration as low as 1 pg, and no cross reactivity was found with DNA from other major RKN species such as M. javanica, M. incognita and M. arenaria, and M. hapla. We also conducted a traditional morphology-based diagnostic assay and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine which of these techniques was less time consuming, more sensitive, and convenient to use in the field. The LAMP assay provided more rapid results, amplifying the target nematode species in less than 60 min at 65{degrees}C, with results 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR (~2-3 hrs). Morphology-based, traditional diagnosis was highly time-consuming (2 days) and more laborious than conventional PCR and LAMP assays. These features greatly simplified the operating procedure and made the assay a powerful tool for rapid, on-site detection of pecan RKN, M. partityla. The LAMP assay will facilitate accurate pecan nematode diagnosis in the field and contribute to the management of the pathogen.","NA"

We describe in detail the steps necessary to realize this approach, as well as discuss key considerations for extending this experimental paradigm to other DBS targets for different therapeutic indications. Additionally, we make recommendations from our experience on implementing and validating the required combination of procedures that includes: the induction of a pathological model (6-OHDA model of Parkinsons disease) through an injection procedure, the injection of the viral vector to induce GCaMP expression, the implantation of the GRIN lens and stimulation electrode, and the installation of a baseplate for mounting the microendoscope. We proactively identify unique data analysis confounds occurring due to the combination of electrical stimulation and optical recordings and outline an approach to address these confounds. In order to validate the technical feasibility of this unique combination of experimental methods, we present data to demonstrate that 1) despite the complex multifaceted surgical procedures, chronic optical recordings of hundreds of cells combined with stimulation is achievable over week long periods 2) this approach enables measurement of differences in DBS evoked neural activity between anesthetized and awake conditions and 3) this combination of techniques can be used to measure electrical stimulation induced changes in neural activity during behavior in a pathological mouse model. These findings are presented to underscore the feasibility and potential utility of minimally constrained optical recordings to elucidate the mechanisms of DBS therapies in animal models of disease.","NA"

Inhibition of Sarm1 has been proposed as a promising neuroprotective strategy with clinical relevance. Yet, the conditions that will most benefit from inhibiting Sarm1 remain undefined. Here we use genetics and pharmacology in zebrafish to show that systemic elimination of Sarm1 is glioprotective. Loss of Sarm1 does not affect macrophage recruitment to the wound microenvironment, focal injury resolution, or nerve repair. Unexpectedly, Sarm1 deficiency increases Schwann-cell resistance to toxicity by diverse chemotherapeutic agents after neuronal injury. Yet, synthetic degradation of Sarm1-deficient severed axons reversed this effect, suggesting that glioprotection is non-cell-autonomous. These findings anticipate that interventions aimed at inhibiting Sarm1 can counter heightened glial vulnerability to chemical stressors and may be an effective strategy to reduce chronic consequences of neurotrauma.","NA"

Although it has served as a key genetic resource for the improvement of domestic cultivars, little is known about the genetic basis of traits underlying local adaptation in this species, nor what abiotic variables are most important for driving differentiation. Here we use redundancy analysis (RDA) and other multivariate statistical methods (structural equation modeling (SEM) and generalized dissimilarity modeling (GDM)) to quantify the relationship of genomic variation (6,830 single nucleotide polymorphisms) with climate and geography, among 140 wild accessions. RDA, SEM, and GDM each identified environment as explaining more genomic variation than geography, suggesting that local adaptation to heterogeneous abiotic habitats may be an important source of genetic diversity in this species. Environmental factors describing temporal variation in precipitation and evaporative demand explained the most SNP variation among accessions, indicating that these forces may represent key selective agents. Lastly, by studying how SNP-environment associations vary throughout the genome (44,064 SNPs), we mapped the location and investigated the functions of loci putatively contributing to climatic adaptations. Together our findings indicate an important role for selection imposed by the abiotic environment in driving genomic differentiation between populations.","NA"

Regions targeted represented broad functional categories potentially involved in species ecological preferences, and a random set of genes. Using a high-quality dedicated pipeline, we provide a detailed characterization of these genic regions, which included over 14500 polymorphisms, with ~12500 SNPs -218 being triallelic-, over 1500 insertion-deletions, and ~200 novel di- and tri-nucleotide SSR loci. This catalog also provides various summary statistics within and among species, gene ontology information, and standard formats to assist loci choice for genotyping projects. The distribution of nucleotide diversity and differentiation across genic regions are also described for the first time in those species (mean{theta}{pi} close to ~0.0049 in Q. petraea and to ~0.0045 in Q. robur across random regions, and mean FST ~0.13 across SNPs), with an estimate across the genome of 41 to 51 million SNPs expected in both species. We observed robust patterns of a slightly but significantly higher diversity in Q. petraea, across a random gene set and in the abiotic stress functional category, and a heterogeneous landscape of both diversity and differentiation. These patterns are discussed in the context of both species documented introgression history despite strong reproductive barriers. The quality of the data provided here and their representativity in terms of species genomic diversity make them useful for possible applications in medium scale landscape and molecular ecology projects. Moreover, they can serve as reference resource for validation purposes in larger-scale re-sequencing projects. This type of project is preferentially recommended in oaks in contrast to SNP array development, given the large nucleotide variation and the low levels of linkage disequilibrium revealed.","NA"

By comparing recombination patterns between multiple populations, we obtain a novel view of recombination at the population-divergence timescale. For each population, a fine-scale recombination map was generated using the coalescent with a standard method based on linkage disequilibrium (LD). These maps revealed higher recombination rates in a domesticated population and a population that has undergone a recent bottleneck. We inferred hotspots of recombination for each population and find that the genomic locations of hotspots correlate with genetic differentiation between populations (FST). We used randomization approaches to generate appropriate null models to understand the association between hotspots of recombination and both DNA sequence motifs and genomic features. We found that hotspot regions contained fewer known retroelement sequences than expected and were overrepresented near transcription start and termination sites. Our findings indicate that recombination hotspots are evolving in a way that is consistent with genetic differentiation but are also preferentially driven to near coding regions. We illustrate that, consistent with predictions in plant domestication, the recombination rate of the domesticated population is orders of magnitude higher than that of other populations. More importantly, we find two fixed mutations in the domesticated populations FIGL1 protein. FIGL1 has been shown to increase recombination rates in Arabidopsis by several orders of magnitude, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed increased recombination rate in the domesticated population.","NA"

Target primers frequently amplify simultaneously multiple loci leading to high PCR and sequencing artefacts such as chimeras and allele amplification bias. Most next-generation sequencing genotyping pipelines have been validated in non-model systems whereby the real genotype is unknown and the generation of artefacts may be highly repeatable. Further hindering accurate genotyping, the relationship between artefacts and copy number variation (CNV) within a PCR remains poorly described. Here we investigate the latter by experimentally combining multiple known major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes of a model organism (chicken, Gallus gallus, 43 artificial genotypes with 2-13 alleles per amplicon). In addition to well defined ""optimal"" primers, we simulated a non-model species situation by designing ""naive"" primers, with sequence data from closely related Galliform species. We applied a novel open-source genotyping pipeline (ACACIA) to the data, and compared its performance with another, previously published, pipeline. ACACIA yielded very high allele calling accuracy (>98%). Non-chimeric artefacts increased linearly with increasing CNV but chimeric artefacts leveled when amplifying more than 4-6 alleles. As expected, we found heterogeneous amplification efficiency of allelic variants when co-amplifying multiple loci. Using our validated ACACIA pipeline and the example data of this study, we discuss in detail the pitfalls researchers should avoid in order to reliably genotype complex multigene systems.

In musical and athletic training, however, these stable motor habits can also impede the attainment of higher levels of performance. We developed an experimental paradigm to induce a specific motor pattern in the context of a discrete sequence production task and to investigate how these habits affect performance over a 3-week training period. Participants initially practiced small segments of 2 to 3 finger movements (""chunks"") and then learned longer sequences composed of these chunks. This initial training induced a persistent temporal pattern during execution, with shorter inter-press-intervals within a chunk and longer ones at chunk boundaries. This pattern remained stable during the subsequent 10 days of training, in which participants were asked to produce the sequence as fast as possible from memory. The habit was also preserved when the sequences were directly displayed, removing the need for memory recall. We were able to induce chunking patterns that were either beneficial or detrimental to performance by taking into consideration the biomechanical constraints of the sequences. While we observed an overall reduction in the detrimental effect of the disadvantageous chunking instructions with training, our results show that the degree to which these detrimental chunk structures were maintained, was predictive of lower levels of final performance. In sum, we were able to induce beneficial and detrimental motor habits in a motor sequence production task and show that these initial instructions influenced performance outcomes over a prolonged period of time.

Significance StatementA habit is defined as an automatized action that resists modification once sufficiently established. Preventing bad habits, while reinforcing good habits, is a key objective when teaching new motor skills. While habit formation is an integral part of motor skill acquisition, previous research has focused on habit formation in terms of action selection. In this paper, we examine habit formation in terms of motor skill execution, after the action has been selected. We were able to induce beneficial or detrimental motor habits in the production of motor sequences. Habits were stable over a prolonged training period. Our results demonstrate how cognitive instruction can lead to persistent motor habits and we explore how these habits are potentially modified with training.","NA"

Every 3 months, cognitive abilities were assessed by a memory-related task and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired. Structural and functional brain networks were estimated and characterized by graph metrics to identify differences between the groups in connectivity, its evolution with age, and its influence on cognition.

In addition, while the structural brain network influenced cognitive outcome in transgenic animals, functional network impacted how control subjects performed. TgF344-AD brain network alterations were present from very early stages, difficult to identify in clinical research.

AUTHOR SUMMARYWe have applied magnetic resonance image based connectomics to characterize TgF344-AD rats, a transgenic model of Alzheimers disease (AD). This represents a highly translational approach, what is essential to investigate potential treatments. TgF344-AD animals were evaluated from early to advanced ages to describe alterations in brain connectivity and how brain networks are affected by age. Results showed that aging had a bigger impact in the structural connectivity of the TgF344-AD than in control animals, and that changes in the structural network, already observed at early ages, significantly influenced cognitive outcome of transgenic animals. Alterations in connectivity were similar to the described in AD human studies, and complement them providing insights into earlier stages and a plot of AD effects throughout the whole life span.","10.1162/netn_a_00126"

Specifically in the hippocampus, CaMKII is required for learning and memory. CaMKII is encoded by four highly conserved genes in vertebrates: , {beta}, {gamma}, and {delta}. AllCaMKIIs are comprised of a kinase domain, regulatory segment, variable linker region, and hub domain responsible for oligomerization. The four genes differ primarily in linker length and composition due to extensive alternative splicing. Here, we unambiguously report the heterogeneity of CaMKII transcripts in 3 complex samples of human hippocampus using Illumina sequencing. Our results show that hippocampal cells contain a diverse collection of 70 CaMKII transcripts from all four CaMKII genes. We characterized the Ca2+/CaM sensitivity of hippocampal CaMKII variants spanning a broad range of linker lengths and compositions. We demonstrate that the effect of the variable linker on Ca2+/CaM sensitivity is conditional on kinase and hub domains. Moreover, we reveal a novel role for the hub domain as an allosteric regulator of kinase activity, which may provide a new pharmacological target for modulating CaMKII activity. Using small angle X-ray scattering and single-particle electron cryo-microscopy, we present evidence for extensive interaction between the kinase and the hub domain, even in the presence of a 30-residue linker. Taken together, we propose that Ca2+/CaM sensitivity in CaMKII is gene-dependent and includes significant contributions from the hub. Our sequencing approach combined with biochemistry provides new insights into understanding the complex pool of endogenous CaMKII.

One Sentence SummaryCaMKII is a well-conserved protein that is essential for learning and memory. When CaMKII is mutated in a mouse, this mouse has difficulty learning and remembering how to get through a maze. The hippocampus is the part of the brain required for memory. Here, we used a specific experiment to determine every type of CaMKII that is in a human hippocampus. We found 70 different types and then asked how these differences affect CaMKII function. These data provide evidence that an assembly domain of CaMKII plays an unexpected role regulating its activity. This new finding helps us better understand endogenous CaMKII in the brain and provides a new mechanism for modulating CaMKII activity.","NA"

Atg8-family proteins have been known to be responsible for autophagosome formation via membrane tethering and fusion events of precursor membrane structures. Nevertheless, how Atg8 proteins act directly upon autophagosome formation still remains enigmatic. Here, to further gain molecular insights into Atg8-mediated autophagic membrane dynamics, we study the two representative human Atg8 orthologs, LC3B and GATE-16, by quantitatively evaluating their intrinsic potency to physically tether lipid membranes in a chemically defined reconstitution system using purified Atg8 proteins and synthetic liposomes. Both LC3B and GATE-16 retained the capacities to trigger efficient membrane tethering at the protein-to-lipid molar ratios ranging from 1:100 to 1:5,000. These human Atg8-mediated membrane tethering reactions require trans-assembly between the membrane-anchored forms of LC3B and GATE-16 and can be reversibly and strictly controlled by the membrane attachment and detachment cycles. Strikingly, we further uncovered distinct membrane curvature dependences of LC3B- and GATE-16-mediated membrane tethering reactions: LC3B can drive tethering more efficiently than GATE-16 for highly-curved small vesicles (e.g. 50 nm in diameter), although GATE-16 turns out to be a more potent tether than LC3B for flatter large vesicles (e.g. 200 and 400 nm in diameter). Our findings establish curvature-sensitive trans-assembly of human Atg8-family proteins in reconstituted membrane tethering, which recapitulates an essential subreaction of the biogenesis of autophagosomes in vivo.","10.1002/pro.3828"

Here, we use helminth parasites to highlight how little is known about parasite diversity, and how insufficient our current approach will be to describe the full scope of life on Earth. Using the largest database of host-parasite associations and one of the worlds largest parasite collections, we estimate a global total of roughly 100,000 to 350,000 species of helminth endoparasites of vertebrates, of which 85% to 95% are unknown to science. The parasites of amphibians and reptiles remain the most poorly described, but the majority of undescribed species are likely parasites of birds and bony fish. Missing species are disproportionately likely to be smaller parasites of smaller hosts in undersampled countries-species that have mostly been understudied over the last century. At current rates, it would take centuries to comprehensively sample, collect, and name vertebrate helminths. While some have suggested that macroecology can work around existing data limitations, we argue that patterns described from a small, biased sample of diversity arent necessarily reliable, especially as host-parasite networks are increasingly altered by global change. In the spirit of moonshots like the Human Genome Project and the Global Virome Project, we propose a global effort to transform parasitology and describe as much of global parasite diversity as possible.

Significance StatementRoughly one in ten parasitic worms has been described by taxonomists, while the majority of species remain unknown to science. Data deficiencies are especially severe for some major groups (reptiles and amphibians) and regions (Africa and Southeast Asia). Decades of work have resulted in much larger datasets on host-parasite interactions, but their utility is limited by major data gaps. At current rates, those gaps could take hundreds of years to be filled. We propose that a globally-coordinated project could dramatically speed up this process, playing a critical role in tracking the disease impacts of global change. If successful, it could be a transformative opportunity for multilateral capacity building, and a path towards more equitable research benefit sharing.","NA"

Moreover, we identified differences in how gut morphology and proliferation respond to diet between surface fish and cavefish.

Using optogenetics and 2-photon calcium imaging, we demonstrate that PFC activity critically encodes trial feedback information, rather than guiding action selection, to enable set-shifting. Moreover, we find that, in two distinct PFC projection populations, representations of trial feedback form a topological gradient, with cells more strongly selective for feedback information located further from the pial surface, regardless of their projection targets.

While significant recovery of function occurs, little is currently understood about the reorganization of the neuronal circuitry, particularly within the dorsal horn. This region receives primary afferent input from the periphery, and cortical input via the somatosensory subcomponent of the corticospinal tract (S1 CST), and is critically important in modulating sensory transmission, both in normal and lesioned states. To determine how dorsal horn circuitry alters to facilitate recovery post-injury, we used an established deafferentation lesion model (DRL/DCL - dorsal root/dorsal column) in male monkeys to remove sensory input from just the opposing digits (D1-D3) of one hand. This results in a deficit in fine dexterity that recovers over several months. Electrophysiological mapping, tract tracing, and immunolabeling techniques were combined to delineate specific changes to dorsal horn input circuitry. Our main findings show that (1) there is complementary sprouting of the primary afferent and S1 CST populations into an overlapping region of the reorganizing dorsal horn, (2) S1 CST and primary afferent inputs connect in different ways within this region to facilitate sensory integration (3) there is a loss of larger S1 CST terminal boutons in the affected dorsal horn, but no change in the size profile of the spared/sprouted primary afferent terminal boutons post-lesion. Understanding such changes helps to inform new and targeted therapies that best promote recovery.

Significance statementSpinal injuries that remove sensation from the hand, can be debilitating, though functional recovery does occur. We examined changes to the neuronal circuitry of the dorsal horn in monkeys following a lesion that deafferented three digits of one hand. Little is understood about dorsal horn circuitry, despite the fact that this region loses most of its normal input after such an injury, and is clearly a major focus of reorganization. We found that both the spared primary afferents and somatosensory corticospinal efferents sprouted in an overlapping region of the dorsal horn after injury, and that larger (presumably faster) corticospinal terminals are lost, suggesting a significantly altered cortical modulation of primary afferents. Understanding this changing circuitry is important for designing targeted therapies.","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2330-19.2020"

Here, we generated replicate controls and reanalyzed published MeRIP-seq data to estimate reproducibility across experiments. We found that m6A peak overlap in mRNAs varies from [~]30 to 60% between studies, even in the same cell type. We then assessed statistical methods to detect changes in m6A peaks as distinct from changes in gene expression. However, from these published data sets, we detected few changes under most conditions and were unable to detect consistent changes across studies of similar stimuli. Overall, our work identifies limits to MeRIP-seq reproducibility in the detection both of peaks and of peak changes and proposes improved approaches for analysis of peak changes.","10.1038/s41598-020-63355-3"

Others report similar transfer via either tunneling nanotubes (TNT) or shed membrane vesicles and this changes the phenotype of recipient cells. Our current time-lapse microscopy showed most exchange was from Fib into MC, with less in the reverse direction. Although TNT were seen, we were surprised transfer was not via TNT, but was instead via fine and often branching cell projections that defied direct visual resolution because of their size and rapid movement. Their structure was revealed nonetheless, by their organellar cargo and the grooves they formed indenting MC, while this was consistent with holotomography. Discrete, rapid and highly localized transfer events, evidenced against a role for shed vesicles. Transfer coincided with rapid retraction of the cell-projections, suggesting a hydrodynamic mechanism. Increased hydrodynamic pressure in retracting cell-projections normally returns cytoplasm to the cell body. We hypothesize  cell-projection pumping (CPP), where cytoplasm in retracting cell-projections partially equilibrates into adjacent recipient cells via micro-fusions that form temporary inter-cellular cytoplasmic continuities. We tested plausibility for CPP by combined mathematical modelling, comparison of predictions from the model with experimental results, and then computer simulations based on experimental data. The mathematical model predicted preferential CPP into cells with lower cell stiffness, expected from equilibration of pressure towards least resistance. Predictions from the model were satisfied when Fib were co-cultured with MC, and fluorescence exchange related with cell stiffness by atomic force microscopy. When transfer into 5000 simulated recipient MC or Fib was studied in computer simulations, inputting experimental cell stiffness and donor cell fluorescence values generated transfers to simulated recipient cells similar to those seen by experiment. We propose CPP as a potentially novel mechanism in mammalian inter-cellular cytoplasmic transfer and communication.

Similar transfer by other mechanisms markedly affects cell behavior. Combined mathematical modelling, satisfaction of predictions from the mathematical model in cell culture experiments, and separate computer simulations that generate outcomes similar to experimental observations, support our hypothesized mechanism.","10.1016/j.bpj.2020.01.025"

Inference of population structure is highly important in molecular epidemiology where pathogen phylogenetics is increasingly used to infer transmission patterns and detect outbreaks. Discrepancies between observed and idealised genealogies, such as those generated by the coalescent process, can be quantified, and where significant differences occur, may reveal the action of natural selection, host population structure, or other demographic and epidemiological heterogeneities. We have developed a fast non-parametric statistical test for detection of cryptic population structure in time-scaled phylogenetic trees. The test is based on contrasting estimated phylogenies with the theoretically expected phylodynamic ordering of common ancestors in two clades within a coalescent framework. These statistical tests have also motivated the development of algorithms which can be used to quickly screen a phylogenetic tree for clades which are likely to share a distinct demographic or epidemiological history. Epidemiological applications include identification of outbreaks in vulnerable host populations or rapid expansion of genotypes with a fitness advantage. To demonstrate the utility of these methods for outbreak detection, we applied the new methods to large phylogenies reconstructed from thousands of HIV-1 partial pol sequences. This revealed the presence of clades which had grown rapidly in the recent past, and was significantly concentrated in young men, suggesting recent and rapid transmission in that group. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of these methods for the study of antimicrobial resistance, we applied the new methods to a large phylogeny reconstructed from whole genome Neisseria gonorrhoeae sequences. We find that population structure detected using these methods closely overlaps with the appearance and expansion of mutations conferring antimicrobial resistance.","10.1093/sysbio/syaa009"

Labeling white matter regions of interest presents many challenges due to the need to integrate both local and global information. Clearly communicating the human/manual processes to capture this information is cumbersome, yet essential to lay a solid foundation for comprehensive atlases. The state-of-the-art for white matter atlas is the single population-averaged Johns Hopkins Eve atlas. A critical bottleneck with the Eve atlas framework is that manual labeling time is extensive and peripheral white matter regions are conservatively labeled. In this work, we developed protocols that will facilitate manual virtual dissection of white matter pathways, with the goals to be anatomically accurate, intuitive, reproducible, and act as an initial stage to build an amenable knowledge base of neuroanatomical regions. We analyzed reproducibility of the fiber bundles and variability of human raters using DICE correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient, and root mean squared error. The protocols at their initial stage have shown promising results on both typical 3T research acquisition Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and high-acquisition quality Human Connectome Project datasets.

Understanding how corticostriatal circuits mediate behavioral selection and initiation in a naturalistic setting is critical to understanding how the brain chooses and executes behavior in unconstrained situations. Central striatum (CS), an understudied region that lies in the middle of the motor-limbic topography, is well-poised to play an important role in these processes since its main cortical inputs (Corbit et al., 2019) have been implicated in behavioral flexibility (lateral orbitofrontal cortex (Kim and Ragozzino, 2005)) and response preparation (anterior lateral motor area, ALM) (Li et al., 2015), However, although CS activity has been associated with conditioned grooming behavior in transgenic mice (Burguiere et al., 2013), the role of CS and its cortical inputs in the selection of spontaneous behaviors has not been explored. We therefore studied the role of CS corticostriatal circuits in behavioral selection in an open field context.

Surprisingly, using fiber photometry in this unconstrained environment, we found that population calcium activity in CS was specifically increased at onset of grooming, and not at onset of other spontaneous behaviors such as rearing or locomotion. Supporting a potential selective role for CS in the initiation of grooming, bilateral optogenetic stimulation of CS evoked immediate onset grooming-related movements. However, these movements resembled subcomponents of grooming behavior and not full-fledged grooming bouts, suggesting that additional input(s) are required to appropriately sequence and sustain this complex motor behavior once initiated. Consistent with this idea, optogenetic stimulation of CS inputs from ALM generated sustained grooming responses that evolved on a time-course paralleling CS activation monitored using single-cell calcium imaging. Furthermore, fiber photometry in ALM demonstrated a gradual ramp in calcium activity that peaked at time of grooming termination, supporting a potential role for ALM in encoding length of this spontaneous sequenced behavior. Finally, dual color dual region fiber photometry indicated that CS activation precedes ALM during naturalistic grooming sequences. Taken together, these data support a novel model in which CS activity is sufficient to initiate grooming behavior, but ALM activity is necessary to sustain and encode the length of grooming bouts. Thus, the use of an unconstrained behavioral paradigm has allowed us to uncover surprising roles for CS and ALM in the initiation and maintenance of spontaneous sequenced behaviors.","NA"

We related the trial-by-trial variability of the attenuation performance to the trial-by-trial functional connectivity of the cortical data.

Across all conditions, we found that a higher performance of pain attenuation was predominantly associated with higher functional connectivity. Of note, we observed an association between low pain and high connectivity for regions that belong to the core areas of pain processing, i.e. the insular and cingulate cortices. For one of the cognitive strategies (safe place), the performance of pain attenuation was explained by diffusion tensor imaging metrics of increased white matter integrity.

Climate change therefore exerts selection pressure on phenology, which is expected to cause the evolution of mean diapause timing, but also phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging strategies. Especially the latter as a strategy to cope with unpredictability is so far little considered in the context of climate change, and it is unknown whether it can readily evolve.

Contemporary patterns of phenological strategies across a geographic range may provide information about their evolvability. We thus extracted 458 diapause reaction norms from 60 studies. First, we correlated mean diapause timing with mean winter onset. Then we partitioned the reaction norm variance into a temporal component (phenotypic plasticity) and among-offspring variance (diversified bet-hedging) and correlated this variance composition with predictability of winter onset. Contrary to our expectation, mean diapause timing correlated only weakly with mean winter onset, as populations at high latitudes failed to track early onsets. Variance among offspring was also limited and correlated only weakly with environmental predictability, indicating little scope for bet-hedging. We conclude that constraints may limit the evolution of phenology in a rapidly changing climate.","NA"

Analogous to this is comparing gene expression across species, which can improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes shaping the evolution of both individual genes and functional pathways. One area of interest is determining genes showing signals of coevolution, which can also indicate potential functional similarity, analogous to co-expression analysis often performed across conditions for a single species. However, as with any trait, comparing gene expression across species can be confounded by the non-independence of species due to shared ancestry, making standard hypothesis testing inappropriate.

ResultsWe compared RNA-Seq data across 18 fungal species using a multivariate Brownian Motion phylogenetic comparative method (PCM), which allowed us to quantify coevolution between protein pairs while directly accounting for the shared ancestry of the species. Our work indicates proteins which physically-interact show stronger signals of coevolution than randomly-generated pairs. Interactions with stronger empirical and computational evidence also showing stronger signals of coevolution. We examined the effects of number of protein interactions and gene expression levels on coevolution, finding both factors are overall poor predictors of the strength of coevolution between a protein pair. Simulations further demonstrate the potential issues of analyzing gene expression coevolution without accounting for shared ancestry in a standard hypothesis testing framework. Furthermore, our simulations indicate the use of a randomly-generated null distribution as a means of determining statistical significance for detecting coevolving genes with phylogenetically-uncorrected correlations, as has previously been done, is less accurate than PCMs, although is a significant improvement over standard hypothesis testing. These methods are further improved by using a phylogenetically-corrected correlation metric.

ConclusionsOur work highlights potential benefits of using PCMs to detect gene expression coevolution from high-throughput omics scale data. This framework can be built upon to investigate other evolutionary hypotheses, such as changes in transcription regulatory mechanisms across species.","NA"

This reserve and its buffer zone is homeland to Yucatec Mayan communities that until recently used to manage their resources following a multiple use strategy (MUS), which involves local agricultural practices and has been proposed as resilience-enhancing mechanism. However, due to the restrictions imposed by the decree of the reserve and the growth of tourism in the region, some of these communities have started to abandon the MUS and specialize on tourism-related activities. We build a dynamical computational model to explore the effects of some of these changes on the capacity of this NPA to conserve the biodiversity and on the resilience of households to some frequent disturbances in the region. The model, through the incorporation of agent-based and boolean network modelling, explores the interaction between the forest, the monkey population and some productive activities done by the households (milpa agriculture, ecotourism, agriculture, charcoal production). We calibrated the model, explored its sensibility, compared it with empirical data and simulated different management scenarios. Our results suggest that those management strategies that do not exclude traditional activities may be compatible with conservation objectives, supporting previous studies. Also, our results support the hypothesis that the MUS, throughout a balanced integration of traditional and alternative activities, is a mechanism to enhance household resilience in terms of income and food availability, as it reduces variability and increases the resistance to some disturbances. Our study, in addition to highlighting the importance of local management practices for resilience, also illustrates how computational modeling and systems perspective are effective means of integrating and synthesizing information from different sources.","NA"

We identify that a cluster of neurons expressing the Oprm1 gene, which encodes the -opioid receptor (MOR) in the lateral subdivision of parabrachial nucleus (PBLOprm1), directly regulates breathing rate in mice by conveying signals from the limbic areas to respiratory rhythm generating neurons in the medullary preBotzinger Complex (preBotC). In addition, we found that pain signals rapidly increase breathing rate by activating these neurons in both awake and anesthetized mice. Inactivating these neurons not only decreases the breathing rate, but it also substantially decreases anxiety-like behaviors and induces strong appetitive behaviors. Furthermore, PBLOprm1 inactivation alleviates pain by attenuating the perception of the affective-motivational aspect of pain. These results suggest that PBLOprm1 neurons play a critical role in the non-homeostatic regulation of breathing and in the regulation of pain and anxiety through breathing.","NA"

This occurs even when the cell cycle is arrested before damaging the centrosomes, thus excluding mitotic failure as the source of replication stress. Mechanistically, the kinase MLK3 associates with centrosomes. When centrosomes are disintegrated, MLK3 activates the kinases p38 and MK2/MAPKAPK2.

The immune-privileged environment and complex organization of retinal tissue allow for the retinas essential role in visual function processes, yet confound inquiries into cell-specific inflammatory effects that lead to retinal dysfunction and degeneration. Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is an integral membrane protein expressed in many retinal cell populations and has been implicated in retinal immune regulation. However, the direction (i.e., promotion or inhibition) in which Cav1 regulates inflammatory processes in the retina (as well as in other tissues) remains unclear. Previously, we showed that global-Cav1 depletion in the retina paradoxically resulted in reduced retinal inflammatory cytokine production with concurrent elevated retinal immune cell infiltration. We hypothesized that our previous results could be explained by cell-specific Cav1 functions in the retina. Here, we utilized our Chx10 (visual system homeobox 2)-Cre knockout model to deplete Cav1 specifically in the neural retinal (NR) compartment in order to clarify the role of neural retinal-specific Cav1 (NR-Cav1) in the retinal immune response to intravitreal LPS (lipopolysaccharide) challenge. Our data support that neural retinal-derived Cav1 promotes retinal tissue inflammation as Chx10-mediated Cav1 depletion was sufficient to suppress both retinal cytokine production and immune cell infiltration following inflammatory stimulation. Additionally, we identify Traf3 (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 3) as a highly expressed potential immune modulator in retinal tissue that is upregulated with NR-Cav1 depletion.

A.; Di Ventura, B.","Barbara Di Ventura","University of Freiburg","2020-01-10",1,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","microbiology","The Escherichia coli Min system plays an important role in the proper placement of the septum ring (Z-ring) at mid-cell during cell division. MinE forms a pole-to-pole spatial oscillator together with the membrane-bound ATPase MinD, which results in MinD having a concentration gradient with maxima at the poles and minimum at mid-cell. MinC, the direct inhibitor of the Z-ring initiator protein FtsZ, forms a complex with MinD at the membrane, thus mirroring MinD polar gradients. Therefore, MinC-mediated FtsZ inhibition occurs away from mid-cell. The existence of the oscillations was revealed by performing time-lapse microscopy with fluorescently-labeled Min proteins. These fusion proteins have been since then widely used to study properties of the Min system. Here we show that, despite permitting oscillations to occur in a range of protein concentrations, the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) C-terminally fused to MinE impairs its function. Combining in vivo, in vitro and in silico approaches, we demonstrate that the eYFP compromises MinE ability to displace MinC from MinD, to stimulate MinD ATPase activity and to directly bind to the membrane. Moreover, we reveal that MinE-eYFP is prone to aggregation. Taken together, our results indicate that this fusion is functionally impaired and should be used with caution in cell biological studies.","NA"

In some bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis strain 168, WTA and LTA both are glycerolphosphate polymers, yet are synthesized by different pathways and have distinct, although not entirely understood morphogenetic functions during cell elongation and division. We show here that the exo-lytic sn-glycerol-3-phosphodiesterase GlpQ can discriminate between B. subtilis WTA and LTA polymers. GlpQ completely degrades WTA, lacking modifications at the glycerol residues, by sequentially removing glycerolphosphates from the free end of the polymer up to the peptidoglycan linker. In contrast, GlpQ is unable to cleave unmodified LTA. LTA can only be hydrolyzed by GlpQ when the polymer is partially pre-cleaved, thereby allowing GlpQ to get access to the end of the polymer that is usually protected by a connection to the lipid anchor. This indicates that WTA and LTA are enantiomeric polymers: WTA is made of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and LTA is made of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate. Differences in stereochemistry between WTA and LTA were assumed based on differences in biosynthesis precursors and chemical degradation products, but so far had not been demonstrated directly by differential, enantioselective cleavage of isolated polymers. The discriminative stereochemistry impacts the dissimilar physiological and immunogenic properties of WTA and LTA and enables independent degradation of the polymers, while appearing in the same location; e.g. under phosphate limitation, B. subtilis 168 specifically hydrolyzes WTA and synthesizes phosphate-free teichuronic acids in exchange.","NA"

In vitro, propranolol amplified the acute, PTH-induced, intracellular calcium signal and elevated Igf1 expression in osteoblasts. In vivo, intermittent PTH and propranolol had synergistic effects in the trabecular bone of the distal femur. The most striking finding was a complete suppression of PTH-induced bone resorption.

However, avian H5N1 influenza virus infections can result in prolonged and fatal illness across all age groups, which has been attributed to the overt and uncontrolled activation of host immune responses. Here we investigate how excessive innate immune responses to H5N1 impair subsequent adaptive T cell responses in the lungs. Using recombinant H1N1 and H5N1 strains sharing 6 internal genes, we demonstrate that H5N1 (2:6) infection in mice causes higher stimulation and increased migration of lung dendritic cells to the draining lymph nodes, resulting in higher numbers of virus specific T cells in the lungs. Despite robust T cell responses in the lungs, H5N1 (2:6) infected mice showed inefficient and delayed viral clearance as compared to H1N1 infected mice. In addition, we observed higher levels of inhibitory signals including increased PD1 and IL-10 expression by cytotoxic T cells in H5N1 (2:6) infected mice, suggesting that delayed viral clearance of H5N1 (2:6) was due to suppression of T cell functions in vivo. Importantly, H5N1 (2:6) infected mice displayed decreased numbers of tissue resident memory T cells as compared to H1N1 infected mice; however, despite decreased number of tissue resident memory T cells, H5N1 (2:6) were protected against a heterologous challenge from H3N2 virus (X31). Taken together, our study provides mechanistic insight for the prolonged viral replication and protracted illness observed in H5N1 infected patients.

ImportanceInfluenza viruses cause upper respiratory tract infections in humans. In healthy adults, seasonal influenza virus infections result in mild disease. Occasionally, influenza viruses endemic in domestic birds can cause severe and fatal disease even in healthy individuals. In avian influenza virus infected patients, the host immune system is activated in an uncontrolled manner and is unable to control infection in a timely fashion. In this study, we investigated why the immune system fails to effectively control a modified form of avian influenza virus. Our studies show that T cell functions important for clearing virally infected cells are impaired by higher negative regulatory signals during modified avian influenza virus infection. In addition, memory T cell numbers were decreased in modified avian influenza virus infected mice. Our studies provide a possible mechanism for the severe and prolonged disease associated with avian influenza virus infections in humans.","10.1128/JVI.00057-20"

Using different single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, we generated hundreds of pseudo-bulk mixtures to evaluate the combined impact of these factors on the deconvolution results.

The asymmetry in the fluctuations of the tilting angle of the rotor determines the direction of rotation. The expressions of the torque and the step size can be derived from a Langevin equation of motion. The drag coefficient of BFM derived from the Langevin equation and the measured torque-speed ({tau}-{omega}) relation is notably high; the viscous force from the environment cannot account for it. The drag force may be caused by the frictional interaction between the bearing-like L- and P-rings of BFM and the cell membrane. Order-of-magnitude estimations of the torque and the step size are consistent with previous experimental observations. The slope of the linear dependence of the rotational frequency on the temperature was estimated and was consistent with the observed value. A simulation device having the structural characteristics of BFM was designed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed mechanism. Many observations for the actual BFM, such as the bidirectional rotation and the {tau}-{omega} relations of the clockwise and counterclockwise rotations, were reproduced in the simulation experiments.

ImportanceThe concept that the torque required for the rotation of the rotor of a bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) can be generated from an impulsive force resulting from the collision between the stator and the rotor is new and effective. The magnitude of the torque and the size of the step derived from the proposed mechanism are consistent with the observed values. The torque-speed ({tau}-{omega}) relation might be explained by the frequency-dependent drag force caused by the frictional interaction between the bearing-like L- and P-rings of BFM and the cell membrane.

Plants growing in coffee fields (anthropogenic habitat) experienced significantly more nectar robbery than plants growing in forest fragments (seminatural habitat). Using a combination of field surveys and manipulative experiments, we found that nectar robbery significantly reduces fruit set in O. cuspidatum, and that the difference in nectar robbing intensity between habitats is due primarily to changes in robber behavior. Nectar robbers robbed plants in coffee more because of differences both in focal plant traits and floral community composition. Nectar robber density was higher in coffee fields, but changes in abundance had a weak effect on nectar robbery. These results suggest that trait changes stemming from environmental change may often drive changes in biotic interactions, despite being less well-studied than the effects of environmental change on organism density.","NA"

In this study, we show that, as expected, there is a strong positive correlation between gene length and the number of SNPs, introns and protein size. Amongst tissue specific genes, we find that the longest genes are expressed in blood vessels, nerve, thyroid, cervix uteri and brain, while the smallest genes are expressed within the pancreas, skin, stomach, vagina and testis. We report, as shown previously, that natural selection suppresses changes for genes with longer lengths and promotes changes for smaller genes. We also observed that longer genes have a significantly higher number of co-expressed genes and protein-protein interactions. In the functional analysis, we show that bigger genes are often associated with neuronal development, while smaller genes tend to play roles in skin development and in the immune system. Furthermore, pathways related to cancer, neurons and heart diseases tend to have longer genes, with smaller genes being present in pathways related to immune response and neurodegenerative diseases.

We hypothesise that longer genes tend to be associated with functions that are important early in life, while smaller genes play a role in functions that are important throughout the organisms whole life, like the immune system which require fast responses.

Author SummaryEven though the human genome has been fully sequenced, we still do not fully grasp all of its nuances. One such nuance is the length of the genes themselves. Why are certain genes longer than others? Is there a common function shared by longer/smaller genes? What exactly makes gene longer? We tried answering these questions using a variety of analysis. We found that, while there was not a particular strong factor in genes that influenced their size, there could be an influence of several gene characteristics in determining the length of a gene. We also found that longer genes are linked with the development of neurons, cancer, heart diseases and muscle cells, while smaller genes seem to be mostly related with the immune system and the development of the skin. This led us to believe that, whether the gene has an important function early in our life, or throughout our whole lives, or even if the function requires a rapid response, that its gene size will be influenced accordingly.","NA"

Although the trends in the discovery of actinobacterial genera isolated from sponges was consistent with previous studies from different study areas, we provide first report of six actinobacterial species from sponges. We observed widespread non-obligate epibiotic predatory behavior in eight actinobacterial genera and we provide first report of predatory activity in Brevibacterium, Glutamicibacter, Micromonospora, Nocardiopsis, Rhodococcus and Rothia. Sponge associated actinobacteria showed significantly more predatory behavior than environmental isolates. While antibacterial activity by actinobacterial isolates mainly affected Gram-positive target bacteria with little to no effect on Gram-negative bacteria, predation targeted both Gram-positive and Gram-negative prey with equal propensity. Actinobacterial isolates from both sponge and associated environment produced inhibitors of serine proteases and angiotensin converting enzyme.

To date, the studies of e-pili have mainly focused on Geobacter sulfurreducens and the closely related Geobacter metallireducens because of their developed genetic manipulation systems. We investigated the role of G. soli pili in EET by directly deleting the pilin gene, pilA, which is predicted to encode e-pili. Deletion of pilA, prevented the production of pili, resulting in poor Fe(III) oxide reduction and low current production, implying that G. soli pili is required for EET. To further evaluate the conductivity of G. soli pili compared with G. sulfurreducens pili, the pilA of G. soli was heterologously expressed in G. sulfurreducens, yielding the G. sulfurreducens strain GSP. This strain produced abundant pili with similar conductivity to the control strain that expressed native G. sulfurreducens pili, consistent with G. soli as determined by direct measurement, which suggested that G. soli pili is electrically conductive. Surprisingly, strain GSP was deficient in Fe(III) oxide reduction and current production due to the impaired content of outer-surface c-type cytochromes. These results demonstrated that heterologous pili of G. sulfurreducens severely reduces the content of outer-surface c-type cytochromes and consequently eliminates the capacity for EET, which strongly suggests an attention should be paid to the content of c-type cytochromes when employing G. sulfurreducens to heterologously express pili from other microorganisms.

IMPORTANCEThe studies of electrically conductive pili (e-pili) of Geobacter species are of interest because of its application prospects in electronic materials. e-Pili are considered a substitution for electronic materials due to its renewability, biodegradability and robustness. Continued exploration of additional e-pili of Geobacter soli will improve the understanding of their biological role in extracellular electron transfer and expand the range of available electronic materials. Heterologously expressing the pilin genes from phylogenetically diverse microorganisms has been proposed as an emerging approach to screen potential e-pili according to high current densities. However, our results indicated that a Geobacter sulfurreducens strain heterologously expressing a pilin gene produced low current densities that resulted from a lack of content of c-type cytochromes, which were likely to possess e-pili. These results provide referential significance to yield e-pili from diverse microorganisms.","NA"

Here, we investigated that NBC-2, conjugated with {gamma}-amino alcohol, significantly reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins; such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase isoform-2 (COX-2), and the production of pro-inflammatory mediator nitric oxide (NO) in lipopolysaccharide and interferon-{gamma} (LPS/IFN-{gamma}) treated mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells, compared with bio-conjugation of {beta}-amino alcohol (NBC-1) or {beta}-amino acid (NBC-3) or -amino acid NBC (NBC-4). NBC-2 decreases the nuclear localization of transcription factors NF-{kappa}B by stabilizing its cytoplasmic functional inhibitor I{kappa}B. Moreover, NBC-2 also displays selective inhibitory effect towards COX-1 enzyme activity as determined by enzymatic assay and in silico molecular docking analysis. Thus, we suggest that NBC-2 may be used as a self-delivery anti-inflammatory drug as compared with other NBCs.

Here we show that the hyperallometric legs in the males of the water strider Microvelia longipes are associated with a specific signature of gene expression during development. Using RNAi knockdown, we demonstrate that a broadly expressed growth factor, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 11 (BMP11, also known as Growth Differentiation Factor 11), regulates leg allometries through increasing the allometric coefficient and mean body size in males. In contrast, BMP11 RNAi reduced mean body size but did not affect slope in females. Furthermore, our data show that a tissue specific factor, Ultrabithorax (Ubx), increases intercept without affecting mean body size. This indicates a genetic correlation between mean body size and variation in allometric slope, but not intercept. Strikingly, males treated with BMP11 RNAi exhibited a severe reduction in fighting frequency compared to both controls and Ubx RNAi-treated males. Overall, we demonstrate a genetic correlation between male body size, the exaggerated weapon, and the intense fighting behaviour associated with it in M. longipes.

While a recent genome-wide association study of PCOS performed in up to 10,074 cases and 103,164 controls of European decent identified 14 PCOS-associated regions, much of the disease pathophysiology remains unclear.

Here, we use a Bayesian colocalization approach to highlight genes that may have a potential role in PCOS pathophysiology and thus are of particular interest for further functional follow-up. We evaluated the posterior probabilities of shared causal variants between PCOS genetic risk loci and intermediate cellular phenotypes in one protein and two expression quantitative trait locus datasets, respectively. Sample sizes ranged from 80 to 31,684. In total, we identified seven proteins or genes with evidence of a shared causal variant for almost a third of PCOS signals, including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and the genes ERBB3, IKZF4, RPS26, SUOX, ZFP36L2, and C8orf49. Several of these genes and proteins have been implicated in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal signalling pathway.

In summary, our results suggest potential effector proteins and genes for PCOS association signals. This highlights genes for functional follow-up in order to demonstrate a causal role in PCOS pathophysiology.","NA"

In this study, we have performed targeted sequencing of a cohort of lung cancer patients on genes involved in chromatin structure, as well as functional experiments to identify the molecular mechanisms linking alterations of chromatin remodeling genes and tumor development.

We have identified ARID2 production loss in 20% of lung cancer patients.

Recent studies carried on ALS patients suggest that the disease may initiate in the motor cortex and spread to its projection targets, along the corticofugal axonal projections (including CSN), either via altered neuronal excitability and subsequent excitotoxicity, or via prion-like propagation of misfolded proteins. We recently provided first experimental arguments in favour of the corticofugal hypothesis of ALS, demonstrating that CSN and other subcerebral projection neurons were toxic in a context of ALS. Here, we aimed to determine how CSN may be detrimental to their downstream targets, and what governs their degeneration. To answer these questions, we took advantage of the FloxedSOD1G37R mouse model of ALS that allows genetic ablation of the mutant transgene in selected cells upon Cre-mediated recombination, and crossed it to the CrymCreERT2 mouse line that we purposely designed to genetically target CSN and other corticofugal projection neurons (CFuPN) populations. We demonstrate that excision of the mutant SOD1G37R transgene from the CSN is sufficient to prevent their death, suggesting that CSN degeneration mostly relies on cell-intrinsic mechanisms. However, genetic ablation of SOD1G37R transgene from the corticofugal neurons had no effect on disease onset and survival. The data thus indicate that the toxicity of CFuPN in the context of ALS, and corticofugal propagation of the disease, are not mediated by the presence of misfolded mutant proteins, but more likely by other aspects of the cortical pathology, possibly hyperexcitability.","NA"

Therefore, animal experiments are needed; however, making small TMS coils suitable for mice is difficult because their field strengths are much lower than for human sized coils.

Objectives/HypothesisWe aimed to design and demonstrate a mouse-specific coil that can generate high and focused E-field.

MethodsWe designed a tapered TMS coil of 50 turns of 0.2 mm diameter copper wire around a 5 mm diameter tapered powdered iron core and discharged a 220 {micro}F capacitor at 50 V through it. We measured B-field with a Hall probe and induced E-field with a wire loop. We measured temperature rise with a thermocouple. We applied 1200 pulses of cTBS and iTBS to mouse brain slices and analysed how spontaneous electrical activity changed.

ResultsThe coil gave maximum B-field of 760 mT and maximum E-field of 32 V/m, 2 mm below the coil, at 50 V power supply with a temperature increase of 20 degrees after 1200 pulses of cTBS. cTBS reduced frequency of spontaneous activity up to 20 minutes after stimulation and iTBS increased frequency of up to 20 minutes after stimulation. No frequency changes occurred after 20 minutes. No frequency changes in amplitude of spontaneous events were found.

The many discovery, safety and regulatory issues they raise may become tractable with polypharmacological combinations of natural compounds found in whole extracts of edible and mixes thereof. The primary goal of this work is to get general insights underlying the innocuity and the emergence of beneficial and toxic activities of combinations of many compounds in general and of edibles in particular. A simplified model of compounds interactions with an organism and of their desired and undesired effects is constructed by considering the departure from equilibrium of interconnected biological features. This model allows to compute the scaling of the probability of significant effects relative to nutritional diversity, organism complexity and synergy resulting from mixing compounds and edibles. It allows also to characterize massive indirect perturbation mode of action drugs as a potential novel multi-compound-multi-target pharmaceutical class, coined Ediceuticals when based on edibles. Their mode of action may readily target differentially organisms system robustness as such based on differential complexity for discovering nearly certainly safe novel antimicrobials and anti-cancer treatments. This very general model provides also a theoretical framework to several pharmaceutical and nutritional observations. In particular, it characterizes two classes of undesirable effects of drugs, and may question the interpretation of undesirable effects in healthy subjects. It also formalizes nutritional diversity as such as a novel statistical supra-chemical parameter that may contribute to guide nutritional health intervention. Finally, it is to be noted that a similar formalism may be further applicable to model whole ecosystems in general.","NA"

This can be adjusted to allow for the effects of environmental stochasticity, or noise, in the population dynamics. However, when multiple fishing entities, which could represent countries, commercial organisations, or individual vessels, can autonomously determine their own fishing effort, the the optimal action for one fishing entity depends on the actions of others. Coupled with noise in the population dynamics, and with decisions about fishing effort made repeatedly, this becomes an iterated stochastic game. We tackle this problem using the tools of stochastic optimisation, first for the monopolists problem and then for the duopolists problem. In each case, we derive optimal policies that specify the best level of fishing effort for a given stock biomass. Under these optimal policies, we can calculate the equilibrium stock biomass, the expected long-term return from fishing and the probability of stock collapse. We also show that there is a threshold stock biomass below which it is optimal to stop fishing until the stock recovers. We then develop an agent-based model to test the effectiveness of simple strategies for responding to deviations by an opponent from a cooperative fishing level. Our results show that the economic value of the fishery to a monopolist, or to a consortium of fishing agents, is robust to a certain level of noise. However, without the means of making agreements about fishing effort, even low levels of noise make sustained cooperation between autonomous fishing agents difficult.","NA"

To test this hypothesis, we introduce a spatially-explicit coalescence model able to reconstruct the species diversity in a sample of water. Our model predicts, in the presence of oceanic currents, a steeper power law decay of the species abundance distribution and a steeper increase of the number of observed species with sample size. A comparison of two metagenomic studies of planktonic protist communities in oceans and in lakes quantitatively confirms our prediction.

Most models of collective decision-making assume that groups reach a consensus during a decision-making bout, often through simple majority rule. In many natural and sociological systems, however, groups may fail to reach consensus, resulting in stalemates. Here, we build on opinion dynamics and collective wisdom models to examine how stalemates may affect the wisdom of crowds. For simple environments, where individuals have access to independent sources of information, we find that stalemates improve collective accuracy by selectively filtering out incorrect decisions. In complex environments, where individuals have access to both shared and independent information, this effect is even more pronounced, restoring the wisdom of crowds in regions of parameter space where large groups perform poorly when making decisions using majority rule. We identify network properties that tune the system between consensus and accuracy, providing mechanisms by which animals, or evolution, could dynamically adjust the collective decision-making process in response to the reward structure of the possible outcomes. Overall, these results highlight the adaptive potential of stalemale filtering for improving the decision-making abilities of group-living animals.","NA"

The fungus Magnaporthe (Syn. Pyricularia) oryzae --the causal agent of blast disease of cereals-- is among the most destructive plant pathogens to world agriculture and a major threat to the production of rice, wheat and other cereals. Although M. oryzae is a multihost pathogen that infects more than 50 species of cereals and grasses, all rice-infecting isolates belong to a single genetically defined lineage. Here, we combined multiple genomics datasets to reconstruct the genetic history of the rice-infecting lineage of M. oryzae based on 131 isolates from 21 countries.

ResultsThe global population of the rice blast fungus consists of a diverse set of individuals and three well-defined genetic groups. Multiple population genetic tests revealed that the rice-infecting lineage of the blast fungus probably originated from a recombining diverse group in South East Asia followed by three independent clonal expansions that took place over the last [~]200 years. Patterns of allele sharing identified a subpopulation from the recombining diverse group that introgressed with one of the clonal lineages before its global expansion. Remarkably, the four genetic lineages of the rice blast fungus vary in the number and patterns of presence/absence of candidate effector genes. In particular, clonal lineages carry a reduced repertoire of effector genes compared with the diverse group, and specific combinations of effector presence/absence define each of the pandemic clonal lineages.

ConclusionsOur analyses reconstruct the genetic history of the rice-infecting lineage of M. oryzae revealing three clonal lineages associated with rice blast pandemics. Each of these lineages displays a specific pattern of presence/absence of effector genes that may have shaped their adaptation to the rice host and their evolutionary history.","NA"

We conducted multiple meta-analyses on neuroimaging results from 151 studies to characterize common and domain-specific brain activity during risky-, ambiguous-, and perceptual-DM. When considering all DM tasks, convergent activity was observed in brain regions considered to be consituents of the canonical salience, valuation, and executive control networks.

However, this competition has been identified when both systems are engaged in learning the same material (motor information), and so competition might be emphasized. We tested whether such competition also occurs when learning involved separate episodic-memory and motor information presented distinctly but yet in close temporal proximity. We measured behavioral and brain-activity correlates of motor-episodic competition during learning using a novel task with interleaved motor-adaptation and episodic-learning demands. Despite unrelated motor versus episodic information and temporal segregation, motor learning interfered with episodic learning and episodic learning interfered with motor learning. This reciprocal competition was tightly coupled to corresponding reductions of fMRI activity in motor versus episodic learning systems.

Many associations between psychometric data, particularly intelligence and personality measures and local variations of brain cortical thickness (CT) have been reported. While the impact of such findings often go beyond scientific communities, resonating in the public mind, their replicability is rarely evidenced.

Here, we empirically investigated the replicability of associations of an extended range of psychometric variables and CT in a large cohort of healthy adults. Our analyses revealed low likelihood of significant associations. Furthermore, significant associations from exploratory analyses showed overestimated effect sizes and were rarely replicable in an independent sample.

We discuss the interpretation and implications of these findings within the context of accumulating evidence of the poor replicability of structural-brain-behaviour associations using grey matter volume, and more broadly of the replicability crisis of brain and behaviour sciences.","NA"

Current pediatric reconstruction options are limited. The aim of this project was to develop a proof of principle porcine model for a load bearing, customized 3-dimensional (3D) printed and BMP2-coated scaffold implanted in a pedicled (temporal) flap as a regenerative approach to pediatric TMJ mandibular condyle reconstruction.

Materials and MethodsScaffolds were custom designed and 3D printed based on porcine computed tomography and absorbed with BMP2. Two operations occured: (1) implantation of scaffold in temporalis muscle to establish vascularity, and six weeks later, (2) unilateral condylectomy and rotation of the vascularized scaffold (with preservation of superficial temporal artery) onto mandibular ramus defect and secured with titanium screws. At 6 months post-implantation, the pigs were sacrified. The experimental side (muscle-scaffold) and the control side (unoperated condyle) were individually harvested at 6 months and evaluated by clinical, mechanical, radiographic, and qualitative/histologic methods.

ResultsScaffolds maintained physical properties similar in appearance to unoperated condyles. The vascularized scaffolds had bone formation at edges and adjacent to scaffold-bone interface. New bone was visible in scaffold. Condyle height on the reconstructed side was 68% and 78% of the control side. Reconstructed condyle stiffness was between 20% and 45% of the control side.

ConclusionIn our porcine model, customized 3D printed TMJ scaffolds impregnanted with BMP2 and implanted in and pedicled on temporalis muscle has the ability to (1) reconstruct a TMJ defect model, (2) maintain appropriate condylar height and upper airway diameter, and (3) generate new bone, without impacting functional outcomes.","NA"

How can we quantify the  personality of an individual? Quantifying intra- and inter-individual variability of behavior, or individual behavioral type, appears to be a prerequisite in the study of animal personality. We propose a statistical method from a predictive point of view to measure the appropriateness of our assumption of  individual behavior in repeatedly measured behavioral data from several individuals. For a model case, we studied the sponge crab Lauridromia dehaani known to make and carry a  cap from a natural sponge for camouflage. Because a cap is most likely to be rebuilt and replaced repeatedly, we hypothesized that each individual crab would grow a unique behavioral type and it would be observed under an experimentally controlled environmental condition. To test the hypothesis, we conducted behavioral experiments and employed a new Bayesian model-based comparison method to examine whether crabs have individual behavioral types in the cap making behavior. Crabs were given behavioral choices by using artificial sponges of three different sizes. We modeled the choice of sponges, size of the trimmed part of a cap, size of the cavity of a cap, and the latency to produce a cap, as random variables in 26 models, including hierarchical models specifying the behavioral types. In addition, we calculated the marginal-level widely applicable information criterion (mWAIC) values for hierarchical models to evaluate and compared them with the non-hierarchical models from the predictive point of view. As a result, the crabs of less than about 9 cm in size were found to make caps from the sponges. The body size explained the behavioral variables namely, choice, trimmed cap characteristics, and cavity size, but not latency. Furthermore, we captured the behavioral type as a probabilistic distribution structure of the behavioral data by comparing WAIC. Our statistical approach is not limited to behavioral data but is also applicable to physiological or morphological data when examining whether some group structure exists behind fluctuating empirical data.","NA"

Apoptosis and senescence are the two main cellular outcomes upon irreversible cell damage. In this study, we show a transition between apoptosis to senescence in cells of two independent tissues in telomerase zebrafish mutants. In young mutants, proliferative tissues exhibit defects in cell proliferation and p53-dependent apoptosis, but no senescence. Progressively, these tissues display signs of tissue dysfunction, loss of cellularity and increased senescence. These alterations are accompanied by an activation of pro-proliferative stimulus mediated by AKT. Consequently, FoxO1 and FoxO4 transcriptional factors are inactivated, reducing SOD2 levels, causing an increase in ROS. These alterations elicit the activation of the zebrafish p16/15 and senescence. Thus, upon telomere shortening in aging, early apoptosis induces compensatory proliferation. However, progressive decline in cell proliferation results in tissue damage and proliferative signals, promoting a switch to senescence.","NA"

However, the molecular pathways that regulate APP internalization and intracellular trafficking in neurons are unknown. Here we report that 5xFAD mice, an animal model of AD, expressing signaling-deficient variants of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) show greater neuroprotection from AD neuropathology than animals lacking this receptor. p75NTR knock-in mice lacking the death domain or transmembrane Cys259 showed lower levels of A{beta} species, amyloid plaque burden, gliosis, mitochondrial stress and neurite dystrophy than global knock-outs. Strikingly, long-term synaptic plasticity and memory, which are completely disrupted in 5xFAD mice, were fully recovered in the knock-in mice. Mechanistically, we found that p75NTR interacts with APP and regulates its internalization in hippocampal neurons. Inactive p75NTR variants internalized much slower and to lower levels than wild type p75NTR, favoring non-amyloidogenic APP cleavage by reducing APP internalization and colocalization with BACE1, the critical protease for generation of neurotoxic APP fragments. These results reveal a novel pathway that directly and specifically regulates APP internalization, amyloidogenic processing and disease progression, and suggest that inhibitors targeting the p75NTR transmembrane domain may be an effective therapeutic strategy in AD.","NA"

The monkeys apply a non-linear forward, time-compressed replay mechanism during the temporal-order judgement. In contrast with humans, such compression of replay is however not sophisticated enough to allow them to skip over irrelevant information by compressing the encoded video globally. We also reveal that the monkeys detect event contextual boundaries and such detection facilitates recall by an increased rate of information accumulation. Demonstration of a time-compressed, forward replay like pattern in the macaque monkeys provides insights into the evolution of episodic memory in our lineage.

Most of them can synthesize it de novo via a conserved pathway. Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, as other trypanosomatids relevant for human health, are heme auxotrophs; thereby they must import it from the hosts. TcHTE protein is involved in T. cruzi heme transport, although its specific role remains elusive. In the present work we study endogenous and recombinant TcHTE in the different life cycle stages of the parasite, in order to approach to its function in heme transport and heme homeostasis. We have confirmed that TcHTE belongs to the HRG protein family, it is predominantly detected in replicative stages (epimastigote and amastigote) and localized mainly in the flagellar pocket of the parasite. We have also demonstrated that T. cruzi epimastigotes can sense intracellular heme content by an unknown mechanism and are able to modulate the expression of TcHTE in order to regulate heme transport. Based on these results, we propose a model in which T. cruzi regulates heme transport activity adjusting the amount of TcHTE present in the cell. This work is, to our knowledge, the first study of an endogenous trypanosomatid HRG protein. The elucidation and characterization of heme transport and homeostasis will contribute to a better understanding of the biology of T. cruzi, a parasite relevant for human health.","NA"

Many genetically encoded biosensors rely on the measurement of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to detect changes in biosensor conformation that accompany the targeted cell signaling event. One of the most robust ways of quantifying FRET is to measure changes in the fluorescence lifetime of the donor fluorophore using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The study of complex signaling networks in living cells demands the ability to track more than one of these cellular events at the same time. Here, we demonstrate how PIE-FLIM can separate and quantify the signals from different FRET-based biosensors to simultaneously measure changes in the activity of two cell signaling pathways in the same living cells in tissues. The imaging system described here uses selectable laser wavelengths and synchronized detection gating that can be tailored and optimized for each FRET pair. Proof-of-principle studies showing simultaneous measurement of cytosolic calcium and protein kinase A activity are shown, but the PIE-FLIM approach is broadly applicable to other signaling pathways.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEHere, we demonstrate that PIE-FLIM can separate and quantify the signals from two different FRETbased biosensors expressed in the same cells in intact tissues. PIE imaging excites the sample with two pulsed lasers of different wavelengths. The individual excitation pulses are delayed relative to one-another so that they are interleaved at the sample, and the detection channels are synchronized to the laser pulses to permit the discrete measurement of two different probe lifetimes. This enables the independent quantification of changing signals from two FRET-based biosensors. The advantage of PIE-FLIM for multiplexed imaging of FRET-based biosensor probes is that the different donor emission signals are separated in time as well as in spectral space minimizing the problem of crosstalk.","10.1016/j.bpj.2020.03.003"

Understanding such host-symbiont feedback effects on symbiont community membership can be crucial for understanding symbiont community structure and function.
C_LIO_LIWe investigate membership for a multitrophic insect symbiont community where symbionts colonize host inflorescences during specific developmental stages termed colonization windows. Inflorescences are host-derived organs and serve as habitat microcosms. Symbionts exhibit a diversity of interactions ranging from mutualism to parasitism. Hosts exhibit immediate feedback by aborting inflorescences not pollinated by mutualistic symbionts and habitats are consequently lost for all other symbiont species. Using relevant empirically measured microcosm parameters, we simulate symbiont dispersal from and colonization of other host inflorescences. We vary host densities and symbiont colonization window lengths, and track the persistence of each symbiont species in the metacommunity based on the temporal availability of the resource and the trophic position of the symbiont.
C_LIO_LISince the persistence of the microcosm habitat is dictated by pollination performed by the mutualist, the mutualist fares better than all other symbionts.

Preclinical studies using Long Access (LgA) cocaine self-administration procedures suggest D-amphetamine may act by preventing tolerance to cocaines effects at the dopamine transporter (DAT). However, Intermittent Access (IntA) cocaine self-administration better reflects human patterns of use, is especially effective in promoting addiction-relevant behaviors, and instead of tolerance, produces psychomotor, incentive, and neural sensitization. We asked, therefore, how D-amphetamine maintenance during IntA influences cocaine use and cocaines potency at the DAT.

MethodsMale rats self-administered cocaine intermittently (5 minutes ON, 25 minutes OFF x 10) for 14 sessions, with or without concomitant D-amphetamine (5 mg/kg/day via s.c. osmotic minipump). In Experiment 1, psychomotor sensitization, responding for cocaine under a progressive ratio schedule, responding under extinction and cocaine-primed relapse were assessed. In Experiment 2, rats self-administered cocaine or saline intermittently, with or without D-amphetamine, and the ability of cocaine to inhibit dopamine uptake in the nucleus accumbens core was assessed using fast scan cyclic voltammetry ex vivo.

ResultsIntA cocaine self-administration produced psychomotor sensitization, strong motivation to take and seek cocaine, and it increased cocaines potency at the DAT. The co-administration of D-amphetamine suppressed both the psychomotor sensitization and high motivation for cocaine produced by IntA experience, and also reversed sensitization of cocaines actions at the DAT, leaving baseline DAT function unchanged.

ConclusionsTreatment with D-amphetamine might reduce cocaine use by preventing sensitization-related changes in cocaine potency at the DAT, consistent with an incentive-sensitization view of addiction.","NA"

To address these knowledge gaps, we applied genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to a denitrifying bioprocess enriched in as-yet-uncultivated denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) affiliated with Candidatus Accumulibacter. The 6 transcriptionally most active populations in the community included three co-occurring Accumulibacter strains affiliated with clades IF (a novel clade identified in this study), IA, and IC, and a competing glycogen accumulating organism (GAO) affiliated with Candidatus Competibacter. Strongly elevated expression of nitrite reductase compared to nitrous oxide reductase was observed in the overall community and in Accumulibacter populations, suggesting a strong role for differential gene expression in driving N2O accumulation. Surprisingly, while [~]90% of nitrite reductase gene transcripts mapped to the three co-occurring PAO populations, [~]93% of nitric oxide reductase gene transcripts were expressed by the GAO population.

However, the underlying mechanisms and biological controls on incomplete denitrification by denitrifying Accumulibacter, their ecological interactions with understudied glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs), and patterns of gene expression under anoxic conditions are all poorly understood. Here, we describe genomic features of a previously unrecognized clade of Accumulibacter that is putatively adapted to high rate P uptake under nitrite-driven denitrification and provide evidence that differential gene expression (namely elevated expression of nitrite reductase compared to nitrous oxide reductase) by Accumulibacter is a key control on nitrous oxide production. Moreover, we document genomic and transcriptional potential for cooperation and crossfeeding of the denitrification intermediate nitric oxide between GAOs and PAOs. This is surprising because GAOs are conventionally considered to be competitors to PAOs, and because nitric oxide is toxic to most microorganisms at low concentrations. Taken together, our work provides significant new understanding of metabolic and ecological interactions in EBPR processes that are critical to environmental protection; demonstrates the potential of previously unrecognized crossfeeding of the denitrification intermediate nitric oxide; and expands our understanding of genomic features and clade level diversity of Accumulibacter.","NA"

Lendenfeldia chondrodes exhibits high thermal tolerance showing no evidence of tissue damage or bleaching at 5 {degrees}C above control water temperature (26 {degrees}C). High-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA V4 region revealed a response of the microbiome of L. chondrodes to short-term exposure to elevated seawater temperature. Shifts in abundance and richness of the dominant bacterial phyla found in the microbiome of this species, namely Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes, characterized this response. The observed resilience of L. chondrodes and the responsiveness of its microbiome to short-term increases in seawater temperature suggest that this holobiont may be capable of acclimating to anthropogenic-driven sublethal environmental stress via a re-accommodation of its associated bacterial community. This sheds a new light on the potential for resilience of some sponges to increasing surface seawater temperatures and associated projected regime shifts in coral reefs.","NA"

Although heavily studied from both theoretical and empirical viewpoints, we have little understanding of how sexual selection influences sex-biased gene regulation during the development of sex-specific phenotypes, and how these changes are reflected in genomic architecture. This is primarily due to the lack of a representative genome and transcriptomes to study the development of secondary sexual traits. Here we present the genome and developmental transcriptomes, focused on the legs of the water strider Microvelia longipes, a species where males exhibit strikingly long third legs used as weapons. The quality of the genome assembly is such that over 90% of the sequence is captured in 13 scaffolds. The most exaggerated legs in males were particularly enriched in sex-biased genes, indicating a specific signature of gene expression in association with sex-specific trait exaggeration. We also found that male-biased genes showed patterns of fast evolution compared to non-biased and female-biased genes, indicative of directional or relaxed purifying selection. Interestingly, we found that female-biased genes that are expressed in the third legs only, but not male-biased genes, were over-represented in the X chromosome compared to the autosomes. An enrichment analysis for sex-biased genes along the chromosomes revealed that they can arrange in large genomic regions or in small clusters of two to four consecutive genes. The number and expression of these enriched regions were often associated with the exaggerated legs of males, suggesting a pattern of common regulation through genomic proximity in association with trait exaggeration. Our findings shed light on how directional sexual selection drives sex-biased gene expression and genome architecture along the path to trait exaggeration and sexual dimorphism.","NA"

Observed differences in winter versus summer microbial taxonomic composition also suggests that phylogenetically conserved traits may permit winter-versus summer-adapted microorganisms to occupy distinct niches. In this study, we sought to identify archaea, bacteria, and fungi that are associated with the soil microbial bloom overwinter and the subsequent biomass collapse following snowmelt at a high-altitude watershed in central Colorado, USA. Archaea, bacteria, and fungi were categorized into three life strategies (Winter-Adapted, Snowmelt-Specialist, Spring-Adapted) based on changes in abundance during winter, the snowmelt period, and after snowmelt in spring. We calculated indices of phylogenetic relatedness (archaea and bacteria) or assigned functional attributes (fungi) to organisms within life strategies to infer whether phylogenetically conserved traits differentiate Winter-Adapted, Snowmelt-Specialist, and Spring-Adapted groups. We observed that the soil microbial bloom was correlated in time with a pulse of snowmelt infiltration, which commenced 65 days prior to soils becoming snow-free. A pulse of nitrogen (N, as nitrate) occurred after snowmelt, along with a collapse in the microbial biomass pool size, and an increased abundance of nitrifying archaea and bacteria (e.g., Thaumarchaeota, Nitrospirae). Winter- and Spring-Adapted archaea and bacteria were phylogenetically clustered, suggesting that phylogenetically conserved traits allow Winter- and Spring-Adapted archaea and bacteria to occupy distinct niches. In contrast, Snowmelt-Specialist archaea and bacteria were phylogenetically overdispersed, suggesting that the key mechanism(s) of the microbial biomass crash are likely to be density-dependent (e.g., trophic interactions, competitive exclusion) and affect organisms across a broad phylogenetic spectrum. Saprotrophic fungi were the dominant functional group across fungal life strategies, however, ectomycorrhizal fungi experienced a large increase in abundance in spring. If well-coupled plant-mycorrhizal phenology currently buffers ecosystem N losses in spring, then changes in snowmelt timing may alter ecosystem N retention potential. Overall, we observed that the snowmelt separates three distinct soil niches that are occupied by ecologically distinct groups of microorganisms. This ecological differentiation is of biogeochemical importance, particularly with respect to the mobilization of nitrogen during winter, before and after snowmelt.","NA"

This increases the complexity of the algorithm and the requirement for computational resources, while processing large MRI volumes with three-dimensional (3D) templates. Hence, reducing the computational complexity of template matching is needed. In this paper, we first propose a mathematical framework for computing the normalized cross-correlation coefficient (NCCC) as the similarity measure between the MRI volume and approximated 3D Gaussian template with linear time complexity,[O] (amaxN), as opposed to the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) based approach with the complexity[O] (amaxNlog N), where N is the number of voxels in the image and amax is the number of tried template radii.

We test our methods on one synthetic and two real multiple-sclerosis databases, and compare its performance in lesion detection with FFT and a state-of-the-art lesion prediction algorithm.

To determine the biological origins of this accuracy, we identify the most predictive regulators and types of regulatory interactions in DEcode, contrasting their roles across many human tissues. Diverse systems biology, ontological and disease-related assessments all point to the predominant influence of post-translational RNA-binding factors on DE.

ResultsHere, we show that ephrin-B2, a member of the Eph:ephrin cell-to-cell communication pathway, sets the neurogenic tempo in the neocortex. Indeed, conditional mutant embryos for ephrin-B2 exhibit a transient delay in neurogenesis and acute stimulation of Eph signaling by in utero injection of synthetic ephrin-B2 led to a transient increase in neuronal production. Using genetic approaches we show that ephrin-B2 acts on neural progenitors to control their differentiation in a juxtacrine manner. Unexpectedly, we observed that perinatal neuron numbers recovered following both loss or gain of ephrin-B2, highlighting the ability of neural progenitors to adapt their behavior to the state of the system in order to produce stereotypical numbers of neurons.

In June, 2017, a fatal MADV infection was confirmed in a community of Darien province.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional outbreak investigation with human and mosquito collections in July 2017, where sera were tested for alphavirus antibodies and viral RNA. Additionally, by applying a catalytic, force-of-infection statistical model to two serosurveys from Darien province in 2012 and 2017, we investigated whether endemic or epidemic alphavirus transmission occurred historically.

ResultsIn 2017, MADV and VEEV IgM seroprevalence was 1.6% and 4.4%, respectively; IgG antibody prevalences were MADV: 13.2%; VEEV: 16.8%; Una virus (UNAV): 16.0%; and Mayaro virus (MAYV): 1.1%. Active viral circulation was not detected. Evidence of MADV and UNAV infection was found near households -- raising questions about its vectors and enzootic transmission cycles. Insomnia was associated with MADV and VEEV infection, depression symptoms were associated with MADV, and dizziness with VEEV and UNAV. Force-of-infection analyses suggest endemic alphavirus transmission historically, with recent increased human exposure to MADV and VEEV in some regions.

ConclusionsThe lack of additional neurological cases suggest that severe MADV and VEEV infections occur only rarely. Our results indicate that, over the past five decades, alphavirus infections have occurred at low levels in eastern Panama, but that MADV and VEEV infections have recently increased -- potentially during the past decade. Endemic infections and outbreaks of MADV and VEEV appear to differ spatially.

Author summaryPrior to 2010, it was believed that the Madariaga virus (MADV) was primarily associated with equine disease. However, an outbreak reported in Panama, in an endemic area where Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) also circulates, suggested a change in its epidemiological profile. We aimed to reconstruct the epidemiological dynamics of MADV and VEEV, as well as additional alphaviruses known to circulate in the region in order to understand MADV emergence. For this, cross-sectional serosurveys were used to demonstrate that the Alphaviruses MADV, VEEV and Una virus have repeatedly infected humans in eastern Panama over the past five decades. Whilst their historical transmission has been low, we confirm that the transmission has recently increased for both MADV and VEEV.","NA"

However, many studies report negative effects of stress experienced by one generation on the performance of subsequent generations. To assess the strength of such transgenerational effects we used a strategy aimed at overcoming the problem of type I errors when testing multiple proxies of stress in multiple ancestors against multiple offspring performance traits, and applied it to a large observational data set on captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We combined clear one-tailed hypotheses with steps of validation, meta-analytic summary of mean effect sizes, and independent confirmatory testing. With this approach we assess to what extent offspring performance in adulthood depends on (1) direct effects of own experiences during early development, (2) indirect condition-transfer effects of the early environment experienced by the parents and the grandparents, and (3) beneficial effects of a match between the environments experienced by the offspring and by its parents. Our study shows that drastic differences in early growth conditions (nestling body mass 8 days after hatching varied 7-fold between 1.7 and 12.4 gram) had only moderate direct effects on adult morphology (95%CI: r=0.19-0.27) and small direct effects on fitness traits (r=0.02-0.12). In contrast, we found no indirect effects of parental or grandparental condition (r=-0.017-0.002; meta-analytic summary of 138 effect sizes), and mixed evidence for small benefits of matching environments, as the latter was not robust to confirmatory testing in independent data sets. This study shows that evolution has led to a remarkable robustness of zebra finches against undernourishment and that transgenerational effects are absent.

Author SummaryHow the early life conditions of your ancestors might influence your own life, an aspect of epigenetic inheritance, has become a popular topic among evolutionary biologists and has sparked much interest by the general public. Many theoretical and empirical studies have addressed this question, leading to theories of adaptive programming and condition transfer and ideas of epigenetic or genetic organization. Despite the popularity of this topic, however, there is a lack of a standard framework to guide empirical studies, which are at risk of over-interpreting the most significant effects that might emerge by chance alone when conducting a large number of tests. In this study, we used long-term observational data on multiple morphological and life-history traits of hundreds of male and female zebra finches with information on the early life conditions of both the focal birds and their parents and grandparents. This allows us to comprehensively quantify the magnitude of direct and transgenerational effects of early developmental conditions. Our study (1) proposes a standardized statistical framework for future investigations, (2) summarizes the average effect size (in zebra finches) and indicates the sample sizes needed to pick up such an effect, and (3) provides a counter statement to a growing faith in the ubiquity of transgenerational effects despite their limited evolutionary or mechanistic plausibility.","NA"

Recently, it has been reported that interaction of miR-122 to HCV RNA induces a conformational change of the 5UTR internal ribosome entry site (IRES) structure to form stem-loop II structure (SLII) and hijack of translating 80S ribosome through the binding of SLIII to 40S subunit, which leads to efficient translation. On the other hand, low levels of HCV-RNA replication have also been detected in some non-hepatic cells; however, the details of extrahepatic replication remain unknown. These observations suggest the possibility that miRNAs other than miR-122 can support efficient replication of HCV-RNA in non-hepatic cells. Here, we identified a number of such miRNAs and show that they could be divided into two groups: those that bind HCV-RNA at two locations (miR-122 binding sites I and II), in a manner similar to miR-122 (miR-122-like), and those that target a single site that bridges sites I and II and masking both G28 and C29 in the 5UTR (non-miR-122-like). Although the enhancing activity of these non-hepatic miRNAs were lower than those of miR-122, substantial expression was detected in various normal tissues. Furthermore, structural modeling indicated that both miR-122-like and non-miR-122-like miRNAs not only can facilitate the formation of an HCV IRES SLII but also can stabilize IRES 3D structure in order to facilitate binding of SLIII to the ribosome. Together, these results suggest that HCV facilitates miR-122-independent replication in non-hepatic cells through recruitment of miRNAs other than miR-122. And our findings can provide a more detailed mechanism of miR-122-dependent enhancement of HCV-RNA translation by focusing on IRES tertiary structure.

Author summaryOne of the determinants for tissue tropism of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is miR-122, a liver-specific microRNA, which is required for efficient propagation. Recently, it has been reported that interaction of miR-122 with the 5UTR of HCV contributes to the folding of a functional IRES structure that is required for efficient translation of viral RNA. In this study, we examined the minimum motifs in the seed region of miRNAs required for the enhancement of HCV replication. As a result, we found two groups of non-hepatic miRNAs: ""miR-122-like miRNAs"" that can bind HCV-RNA at two locations in a manner similar to miR-122, and ""non-miR-122-like miRNAs"" that target a single site that masking both G28 and C29 in the 5UTR. The interaction of these non-hepatic miRNAs with the 5UTR can facilitate not only the folding of active HCV IRES but also the stabilization of IRES 3D structure in order to facilitate binding to the ribosome. These results suggest the possibility of replication of HCV in non-hepatic cells through interaction with miRNAs other than miR-122 and provide insight into the establishment of persistent infection of HCV in non-hepatic tissues that lead to the development of extrahepatic manifestations.","NA"

One-humped camels are important economic livestock species in Africa used for traction, transportation, and food. Regional and international trade has continued to increase the risk of this disease, spreading widely and causing severe economic and public health catastrophes in affected regions. In spite of these risks, there is a dearth of information about the status of RVF in camels in Nigeria. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of the RVF virus in one-humped camels in Nigeria and identify the risk factors associated with the disease.

MethodsA cross-sectional study with simple random sampling was carried out in seven local government areas of Jigawa and Katsina States. The sera from camels were tested for anti-RVFV IgG. Camel owners were administered a structured questionnaire to ascertain their knowledge, attitude, and practice.

ResultsAn overall prevalence of 19.9% (95% CI; 17.07-22.90) was recorded. Based on age groups, the highest prevalence of 20.9% (95% CI; 17.00-25.31) was obtained among older camels (6-10 years), while female camels recorded a high prevalence of 20.4% (95%CI; 15.71-25.80). Sule Tankar-kar recorded the highest prevalence with 33% (95%CI; 1.31-4.72, p= 0.007) and OR 2.47 in Jigawa State while Maiadua had 24.7% (95%CI; 0.97-2.73, p=0.030) with OR 1.62 in Katsina State respectively. From the risk map, local government areas bordering Niger Republic were at a high risk of RVF. Only high rainfall was not significantly linked with RVF occurrence among nomadic camel pastoralists (95%CI 0.93-5.20; p=0.070).

ConclusionThere is a need for the country to have quarantine units across borders for screening animals coming from neighbouring countries for transboundary infectious diseases such as RVF.

Author SummaryRift Valley fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that affects animals and humans with high mortality. Recently there has been increased demand in camel meat and products for food and therapeutic purposes. Climate change, coupled with insecurity in the Sahel, has had a significant impact on transhumance activities where camels and their owners move to different countries in search of pasture for their animals. Though Nigeria has not reported an outbreak of Rift Valley fever despite serological evidence in various animal species, there is a need to assess RVF in camels, which is a critical animal species, involved in transhumance with the potential of introducing transboundary diseases into new areas. The study assessed the presence of antibodies in camels, identified risk factors associated with the disease in camels and areas at risk for the disease. Our study found a seroprevalence of 19.9% in camels in two northern states of Nigeria, which shares a boundary with the Niger Republic that recently reported an outbreak. Our findings suggest that areas in proximity to Niger Republic are at a high risk to the disease and camels belonging to transhumance pastoralists are highly likely to contract Rift Valley fever since they are exposed to various ecological and environmental factors that precipitate the disease.","NA"

Nevertheless, how the plant ssDNA begomovirus hijacks the host intracytoplasmic transport machinery to move from the nucleus to the plasmodesma remains enigmatic. Here, we identified nuclear shuttle protein (NSP)-interacting proteins by probing a protein microarray and demonstrated that viral NSP, a facilitator of the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of viral (v)DNA, interacts with a new endosomal vesicle-localized plant-specific syntaxin-6 protein, designated NISP in planta. We also showed that begomovirus infection requires the NISP-NSP interaction; NISP displays a pro-viral function, but not the syntaxin-6 paralog AT2G18860 that failed to interact with NSP. Consistent with these findings, nisp-1 mutant plants were less susceptible to begomovirus infection, a phenotype reversed by NISP complementation, whereas overexpressing lines accumulated higher levels of viral DNA than wild-type. Furthermore, NISP interacts with NIG, another pro-viral factor that accessorizes the NSP-vDNA nucleocytoplasmic translocation. Additionally, the NISP-NIG interaction is enhanced by NSP. We also showed that NISP associates with vDNA and might assemble a NISP-NIG-NSP-vDNA- complex. NISP may function as a docking site for recruiting NIG and NSP into trafficking vesicles, providing a mechanism for the intracytoplasmic translocation of the NSP-vDNA complex towards the cell periphery.

Author SummaryAs viruses must use an active and directed intracellular movement, they hijack the intracellular host transport system for their benefit. Therefore, the identification of interactions between host proteins and begomovirus movement proteins should target the intracellular transport machinery. This work focused on the identification of these protein-protein interactions; it addressed the molecular bases for the intracellular transport of begomoviruses. We used a protein microarray to identify cellular partners for the movement protein (MP) and the viral nuclear shuttle protein (NSP), which is a facilitator of the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of viral (v)DNA. We identified relevant protein-protein interaction (PPI) hubs connecting host and viral proteins. We revealed a novel NSP-interacting protein, which functions in the intracytoplasmic transport of proteins and DNA from begomoviruses and was designated NSP-interacting syntaxin domain-containing protein (NISP). Our data suggest an intracellular route connecting the release of newly-synthesized begomoviral DNA in the cytosol with the cell surface. Resolving viral DNA-host protein complexes led to the identification of a novel class of components of the cell machinery and a representative member, NISP, that functions as a susceptibility gene against begomoviruses. As geminiviruses pose a severe threat to agriculture and food security, this recessive gene can now be exploited as a target for engineering resistance by gene editing in crops.","NA"

However, the relationship between them is not completely elucidated. We aimed to investigate whether patients with HF are predisposed to cancer development using the large Korean National Health Insurance claims database.

Methods and findingsThis study included 128,441 HF patients without a history of cancer and 642,205 age- and sex-matched individuals with no history of cancer and HF between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2015. During a median follow-up of 4.06 years, 11,808 patients from the HF group and 40,805 participants from the control were newly diagnosed with cancer (cumulative incidence, 9.2% vs. 6.4%, p<0.0001). Patients with HF presented a higher risk for cancer development compared to controls in multivariable Cox analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61 - 1.68). The increased risk was consistent for all site-specific cancers. To minimize potential surveillance bias, additional analysis was performed by eliminating participants who developed cancer within the initial 2 years of HF diagnosis (i.e. 2-year lag analysis). In the 2-year lag analysis, the higher risk of overall cancer remained significant in patients with HF (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.13), although the association was weaker. Among the site-specific cancers, three types of cancer (lung, liver/biliary/pancreas, and hematologic malignancy) were consistently at higher risk in patients with HF.

ConclusionsCancer incidence is higher in patients with HF than in the general population. Active surveillance of coexisting malignancy needs to be considered in these patients.","NA"

Several strategies are routinely used to prevent the spurious incorporation of noise within reconstructed volumes, the most common being independent refinement of two sides of a split dataset.

In this study, we show that over-fitting remains an issue within regions of low local signal-to-noise in reconstructed volumes refined using the half-set strategy. We propose a modified filtering process during refinement through the application of a local signal-to-noise filter, SIDESPLITTER, which we show to be capable of reducing over-fitting in both idealised and experimental settings, while maintaining independence between the two sides of a split refinement.

Despite this advance, few genetic interactions have been reproduced across multiple studies and many appear highly context-specific. Understanding which genetic interactions are robust in the face of the molecular heterogeneity observed in tumours and what factors influence this robustness could streamline the identification of therapeutic targets. Here, we develop a computational approach to identify robust genetic interactions that can be reproduced across independent experiments and across non-overlapping cell line panels. We used this approach to evaluate >140,000 potential genetic interactions involving cancer driver genes and identified 1,520 that are significant in at least one study but only 220 that reproduce across multiple studies. Analysis of these interactions demonstrated that: (i) oncogene addiction effects are more robust than oncogene-related synthetic lethal effects; and (ii) robust genetic interactions in cancer are enriched for gene pairs whose protein products physically interact. This suggests that protein-protein interactions can be used not only to understand the mechanistic basis of genetic interaction effects, but also to prioritise robust targets for further development. To explore the utility of this approach, we used a protein-protein interaction network to guide the search for robust synthetic lethal interactions associated with passenger gene alterations and validated two novel robust synthetic lethalities.","NA"

This has made it difficult for objective assessments of both assays and instruments, in-turn leading to significant hindrances in scientific progress, specifically in the study of EVs, where the phenotypic analysis of these submicron-sized vesicles is becoming common-place in every biomedical field.

Both can modify the elemental composition (i.e. stoichiometry) of primary producers and consumers. Yet their combined effect on the stoichiometry, dynamics, and stability of ecological communities remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we extended the Rosenzweig-MacArthur consumer-resource model by including thermal dependencies, nutrient dynamics, and stoichiometric constraints on both the primary producer and the consumer. We found that stoichiometric constraints dampen the paradox of enrichment and increased persistence at high nutrient levels. Nevertheless, they also reduced consumer persistence at extreme temperatures. Finally, we also found that stoichiometric constraints can strongly influence biomass distribution across trophic levels by modulating consumer assimilation efficiency and resource growth rates along the environmental gradients. In the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model, consumer biomass exceeded resource biomass for most parameter values whereas, in the stoichiometric model, consumer biomass was strongly reduced and sometimes lower than resource biomass. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for stoichiometric constraints as they can mediate the temperature and nutrient impact on the dynamics and functioning of ecological communities.","NA"

These so-called  spontaneous epimutations appear to be a byproduct of imperfect DNA methylation maintenance during mitotic or meitotic cell divisions. Accurate estimates of the rate and spectrum of these stochastic events are necessary to be able to quantify how epimutational processes shape methylome diversity in the context of plant evolution, development and aging.

MethodHere we describe AlphaBeta, a computational method for estimating epimutation rates and spectra from pedigree-based high-throughput DNA methylation data. The approach requires that the topology of the pedigree is known, which is typically the case in the experimental construction of mutation accumulation lines (MA-lines) in sexually or clonally reproducing species. However, this method also works for inferring somatic epimutation rates in long-lived perennials, such as trees, using leaf methylomes and coring data as input. In this case, we treat the tree branching structure as an intra-organismal phylogeny of somatic lineages and leverage information about the epimutational history of each branch.

ResultsTo illustrate the method, we applied AlphaBeta to multi-generational data from selfing- and asexually-derived MA-lines in Arabidopsis and dandelion, as well as to intra-generational leaf methylome data of a single poplar tree. Our results show that the epimutation landscape in plants is deeply conserved across angiosperm species, and that heritable epimutations originate mainly during somatic development, rather than from DNA methylation reinforcement errors during sexual reproduction. Finally, we also provide the first evidence that DNA methylation data, in conjunction with statistical epimutation models, can be used as a molecular clock for age-dating trees.

ConclusionAlphaBeta faciliates unprecedented quantitative insights into epimutational processes in a wide range of plant systems. Software implementing our method is available as a Bioconductor R package at http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.10/bioc/html/AlphaBeta.html","NA"

Because CF-causing mutations affect both CFTR permeation/gating and biogenesis, multi-assay approaches have been implemented in drug development, sequentially screening for channel function and membrane density. Here we present the first assay capable of simultaneous assessment of both CFTR characteristics.

Images of live HEK293 cells co-expressing a soluble and a CFTR-tagged fluorescent protein are analysed to quantify both CFTR membrane density and ion channel function. We monitor F508del-CFTR, the most common disease-causing mutant. Furthermore, we characterize a panel of 62 CF-causing mutations and profile effects of acute treatment with approved drug VX-770, mapping potentiation on CFTR structures.

We validate our assay by confirming F508del-CFTR rescue by incubation at low temperature, treatment with CFTR-targeting drugs and introduction of second-site revertant mutation R1070W. Measurements using the rare-mutation panel also correlate well with published results.

Mapping the potentiation profile on CFTR structures raises mechanistic hypotheses on drug action, suggesting that VX-770 might allow an open-channel conformation with an alternative arrangement of domain interfaces around site 1.

The assay is a powerful tool for investigation of CFTR ion channel biophysics, allowing rapid and accurate inferences on gating/permeation properties and on how these are affected by mutations and compounds. By providing a two-dimensional molecular characterization of mutant CFTR proteins, our assay can better inform development of therapies tailored for individual CFTR variants. Finally, the integrated assay boosts the potential for discovery of dual-acting compounds, simultaneously repairing both biogenesis and function.

SummaryCFTR mutations cause cystic fibrosis by affecting how many channels reach the membrane, and/or how well they work. JGP study presents an assay that simultaneously measures CFTR biogenesis and function. A screen of 62 disease-causing mutations provides clues on how approved drug VX-770 works.

In this work, we question whether minimal clock models (Goodwin models) are sufficient to reproduce essential phenotypes of the clock: a small phase response curve (PRC), fast jetlag and seasonal phase shifts. Instead of building a single best model, we take an approach where we study the properties of a set of models satisfying certain constraints; here a one-hour pulse PRC with a range of three hours and clock periods between 22h and 26h. Surprisingly, almost all these randomly parameterized models showed a four hour change in phase of entrainment between long and short days and jetlag durations of three to seven days in advance and delay. Moreover, intrinsic clock period influenced jetlag duration and entrainment amplitude and phase. Fast jetlag was realized in this model by means of an interesting amplitude effect: the association between clock amplitude and clock period termed  twist. This twist allows amplitude changes to speed up and slow down clocks enabling faster shifts. These findings were robust to the addition of positive feedback to the model. In summary, the known design principles of rhythm generation - negative feedback, long delay and switch-like inhibition (we review these in detail) - are sufficient to reproduce the essential clock phenotypes. Furthermore, amplitudes play a role in determining clock properties and must be always considered, although they are difficult to measure.","10.1016/j.jmb.2020.01.014"

Thus, the identification of robust gene-phenotype associations is crucial for interpreting pathogenesis. How to integrate the methylation values of different sites on the same gene and to mining the DNA methylation at the gene level remains a challenge. A recent study found that the DNA methylation difference of the gene body and promoter region has a strong correlation with gene expression. In this study, we proposed a Statistical difference of DNA Methylation between Promoter and Other Body Region (SIMPO) algorithm to extract DNA methylation values at the gene level. First, by choosing to smoke as an environmental exposure factor, our method led to significant improvements in gene overlaps (from 5% to 17%) between different datasets.

Here we experimentally investigated how intraspecific difference among herbivore lineages specialized on different host plants influences the strength of trophic cascade in a terrestrial tritrophic system. We found that the occurrence and strength of the trophic cascade are strongly influenced by herbivores lineage and host-plant specialization but are not associated with density-dependent effects mediated by the growth rate of herbivore populations.

A.; Garrett, D. D.","Julian Q. Kosciessa","Max Planck Institute for Human Development","2020-01-11",2,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","neuroscience","Multiscale Entropy (MSE) is used to characterize the temporal irregularity of neural time series patterns. Due to its presumed sensitivity to non-linear signal characteristics, MSE is typically considered a complementary measure of brain dynamics to signal variance and spectral power. However, the divergence between these measures is often unclear in application. Furthermore, it is commonly assumed (yet sparingly verified) that entropy estimated at specific time scales reflects signal irregularity at those precise time scales of brain function. We argue that such assumptions are not tenable. Using simulated and empirical electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 47 younger and 52 older adults, we indicate strong and previously underappreciated associations between MSE and spectral power, and highlight how these links preclude traditional interpretations of MSE time scales. Specifically, we show that the typical definition of temporal patterns via ""similarity bounds"" biases coarse MSE scales - that are thought to reflect slow dynamics - by high-frequency dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that entropy at fine time scales - presumed to indicate fast dynamics - is highly sensitive to broadband spectral power, a measure dominated by low-frequency contributions. Jointly, these issues produce counterintuitive reflections of frequency-specific content on MSE time scales. We emphasize the resulting inferential problems in a conceptual replication of cross-sectional age differences at rest, in which scale-specific entropy age effects could be explained by spectral power differences at mismatched temporal scales. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such problems may be alleviated, resulting in the indication of scale-specific age differences in rhythmic irregularity. By controlling for narrowband contributions, we indicate that spontaneous alpha rhythms during eyes open rest transiently reduce broadband signal irregularity. Finally, we recommend best practices that may better permit a valid estimation and interpretation of neural signal irregularity at time scales of interest.

Author SummaryBrain signals exhibit a wealth of dynamic patterns that that are thought to reflect ongoing neural computations. Multiscale sample entropy (MSE) intends to describe the temporal irregularity of such patterns at multiple time scales of brain function. However, the notion of time scales may often be unintuitive. In particular, traditional implementations of MSE are sensitive to slow fluctuations at fine time scales, and fast dynamics at coarse time scales. This conceptual divergence is often overlooked and may lead to difficulties in establishing the unique contribution of MSE to effects of interest over more established spectral power. Using simulations and empirical data, we highlight these issues and provide evidence for their relevance for valid practical inferences. We further highlight that standard MSE and traditional spectral power are highly collinear in our example. Finally, our analyses indicate that spectral filtering can be used to estimate temporal signal irregularity at matching and intuitive time scales. To guide future studies, we make multiple recommendations based on our observations. We believe that following these suggestions may advance our understanding of the unique contributions of neural signal irregularity to neural and cognitive function across the lifespan.","NA"

DMF is not known to exist in nature and was first synthesized in 1893. In spite of the recent origin of DMF, certain bacterial species such as Paracoccus, Pseudomonas, and Alcaligenes have evolved pathways to breakdown DMF and use them as carbon and nitrogen source for growth(2, 3). The work presented here provides a molecular basis for the ability of DMFase from Paracoccus to function in exacting conditions of high solvent concentrations, temperature and ionic strength to catalyze the hydrolysis of a stable amide bond. The structure reveals a multimeric complex of the 2{beta}2 type or (2{beta}2)2 type. One of the three domains of the large subunit and the small subunit are hitherto undescribed folds and as yet of unknown evolutionary origin. The active site is made of a distinctive mononuclear iron that is coordinated by two tyrosine residues and a glutamic acid residue. The hydrolytic cleavage of the amide bond is catalyzed at the Fe3+ site with a proximal glutamate probably acting as the base. The change in the quaternary structure is salt dependent with high salt resulting in the larger oligomeric state. Kinetic characterization reveals an enzyme that shows cooperativity between subunits and the structure provides clues on the interconnection between the active sites.

Significance StatementN,N-dimethyl formamide(DMF) is a commonly used industrial solvent that was first synthesized in 1893. The properties that make DMF a highly desired solvent also makes it a difficult compound to breakdown. Yet, certain bacteria have evolved to survive in environments polluted by DMF and have enzymes that breakdown DMF and use it as their carbon and nitrogen source. The molecular structure of the enzyme that breaks down the stable amide bond in these bacteria, reveals two new protein folds and a unique mononuclear iron active site. The work reported here provides the structural and biochemical framework to query the evolutionary origins of the protein, as well as in engineering this enzyme for use in bioremediation of a human made toxic solvent.","NA"

One understudied mechanism of chemoresistance is the induction of quiescence, a reversible non-proliferative state. Unfortunately, little is known about regulators of quiescence. Here we identify the master transcription factor NFATC4 as a regulator of quiescence in ovarian cancer. NFATC4 is enriched in ovarian cancer stem-like cells (CSC) and correlates with decreased proliferation and poor prognosis. Treatment of cancer cells with cisplatin results in NFATC4 nuclear translocation and activation of NFATC4 pathway, while inhibition of the pathway increased chemotherapy response. Induction of NFATC4 activity results in a marked decrease in proliferation, G0 cell cycle arrest and chemotherapy resistance, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, NFATC4 drives a quiescent phenotype in part via downregulation of MYC. Together these data identify that NFATC4 as a driver of quiescence and a potential new target to combat chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.","10.1172/jci.insight.131486"

Demographic inference based on the coalescent theory has been used to reconstruct the population dynamics and evolutionary history of several species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), an important human pathogen causing tuberculosis. One key assumption of Kingmans coalescent is that the number of descendants of different individuals does not vary strongly, and violating this assumption could lead to severe biases caused by model misspecification. Individual lineages of MTB are expected to vary strongly in reproductive success because 1) MTB is potentially under constant selection due to the pressure of the host immune system, 2) MTB undergoes repeated population bottlenecks when it transmits from one host to another, and 3) some hosts show much higher transmission rates compared to the average (""super-spreaders"").

Here we used an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to test whether multiple merger coalescents (MMC), a class of models that allow for large variation in offspring sizes, are more adequate models to study MTB populations. We considered eleven publicly available whole genome sequence data sets sampled from MTB local populations and outbreaks and found that MMC had a better fit compared to the Kingman coalescent for nine of the eleven data sets. These results indicate that the neutral model for analyzing MTB outbreaks, and potentially the outbreaks of other pathogens, should be reassessed, and that past findings based on the Kingman coalescent need to be revisited.","NA"

Key issues include statistical selection of a demographic and historical scenario among a set of possible scenarios, and estimation of the parameter(s) of interest under the chosen scenario. Such inferences greatly benefit from new statistical approaches including approximate Bayesian computation - Random Forest (ABC-RF), the latter providing reliable inference at a low computational cost, with the possibility to take into account prior knowledge on both biogeographical history and genetic markers. Here, we used ABC-RF, including independent information on evolutionary rate and pattern at microsatellite markers, to decipher the evolutionary history of the African arid-adapted pest locust, Schistocerca gregaria. We found that the evolutionary processes that have shaped the present geographical distribution of the species in two disjoint northern and southern regions of Africa were recent, dating back 2.6 Ky (90% CI: 0.9 - 6.6 Ky). ABC-RF inferences also supported a southern colonization of Africa from a low number of founders of northern origin. The inferred divergence history is better explained by the peculiar biology of S. gregaria, which involves a density-dependent swarming phase with some exceptional spectacular migrations, rather than a continuous colonization resulting from the continental expansion of open vegetation habitats during more ancient Quaternary glacial climatic episodes.","NA"

These poly-basic sequences are mainly studied with reporter systems, where artificial sequences are introduced into heterologous genes. The unique example of a yeast protein containing a polybasic domain that was described as a target of the RQC complex is Rqc1, a protein essential for RQC function. Rqc1 poly-basic sequences are thought to be necessary to activate the RQC, leading to protein down-regulation. We aimed to determine whether the RQC complex acts as a regulatory mechanism for other endogenous proteins containing similar poly-basic sequences. Here, we show by bioinformatics, ribosome profiling data, and western blot protein quantification that endogenous proteins containing poly-basic sequences similar to or even more positively charged than those of Rqc1 are not targeted by the RQC complex, suggesting that endogenous poly-basic sequences are not sufficient to induce this type of regulation. We further demonstrate that Rqc1, previously described as an RQC target, is not regulated by the RQC complex, but instead by Ltn1, the E3 component of the complex, alone. Our data suggest that Ltn1 is able to regulate the expression of Rqc1 post-translationally and independent of the RQC complex.","NA"

Here we explore training models using subimage stacks composed of channels sampled from larger,  hyper-labeled, image stacks (e.g. only the brightfield channels). This allows us to directly compare a variety of segmentation and training approaches on identical cells. This approach revealed that fluorescence-based strategies generally provide higher segmentation accuracies, but dipped below label-free models when labeling was inconsistent. The relative strengths of label and label-free techniques could be combined through the use of merging fluorescence channels and using out-of-focus brightfield images. Beyond comparing segmentation strategies, using subimage stacks for training was also found to provide a method of simulating a wide range of labeling conditions during training, increasing the ability of the final model to accomodate a fuller range of experimental setups.","NA"

As such, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumors, exhibit constitutive UPR signals to sustain growth. Herein, we showed that signaling elicited by one of the UPR sensors, IRE1, promotes GBM tumor invasion, angiogenesis and infiltration by macrophages. Hence, high IRE1 activity in tumors predicts worse outcome. We further dissect IRE1-dependent mechanisms that shape the brain tumor immune microenvironment towards myeloid cells. We identify an IRE1-dependent signaling pathway that directly controls the expression/release of proinflammatory chemokines (CXCL2, IL6, IL8) leading to tumor cell-mediated chemoattraction of neutrophils and macrophages. This pathway requires XBP1 non-conventional mRNA splicing and XBP1s-dependent expression of the E2 ubiquitin enzyme UBE2D3.

This is particularly powerful in animal models, allowing these networks to be probed using complementary methods. However, most animals must be anesthetized for neuroimaging, giving rise to complications resulting from anesthetic effects on the animals physiological and neurological functions. For example, an established protocol for feline neuroimaging involves co-administration of ketamine and isoflurane - the latter of which is known to suppress cortical function.

New MethodHere, we compare this established protocol to alfaxalone, a single-agent anesthetic for functional neuroimaging. We first compare the two in a controlled environment to assess relative safety and to measure physiological stability over an extended time window. We then compare patterns of auditory and visually-evoked activity measured at 7T to assess mean signal strength and between-subjects signal variability.

Results in Comparison with Existing MethodsWe show that alfaxalone results in more stable respiratory rates over the 120 minutes testing period, with evidence of smaller between measurements variability within this time window, when compared to ketamine plus isoflurane. Moreover, we demonstrate that both agents evoke similar mean BOLD signals across animals, but that alfaxalone elicits more consistent BOLD activity in response to sound stimuli across all ROIs observed.

ConclusionsAlfaxalone is observed to be more physiologically stable, evoking a more consistent BOLD signal across animals than the co-administration of ketamine and isoflurane. Thus, an alfaxalone-based protocol may represent a better approach for neuroimaging in animal models requiring anesthesia.","10.1016/j.jneumeth.2020.108603"

We build a spatially explicit dynamical model that couples a multispecies community and its abiotic environment. We use numerical simulations and analytical techniques to determine the biotic and abiotic conditions under which ecotone emergence is expected to occur, and the role of biodiversity therein. We show that the diversity of ecosystem engineers can lead to indirect interactions through the modification of their shared environment. These interactions, which can be either competitive or mutualistic, can lead to the emergence of discrete communities in space, separated by sharp ecotones where a high species turnover is observed. Considering biodiversity is thus critical when studying the influence of species-environment interactions on the emergence of ecotones.

This reserve and its buffer zone is homeland to Yucatec Mayan communities that until recently used to manage their resources following a multiple use strategy (MUS), which involves local agricultural practices and has been proposed as resilience-enhancing mechanism. However, due to the restrictions imposed by the decree of the reserve and the growth of tourism in the region, some of these communities have started to abandon the MUS and specialize on tourism-related activities. We build a dynamical computational model to explore the effects of some of these changes on the capacity of this NPA to conserve the biodiversity and on the resilience of households to some frequent disturbances in the region. The model, through the incorporation of agent-based and boolean network modelling, explores the interaction between the forest, the monkey population and some productive activities done by the households (milpa agriculture, ecotourism, agriculture, charcoal production). We calibrated the model, explored its sensibility, compared it with empirical data and simulated different management scenarios. Our results suggest that those management strategies that do not exclude traditional activities may be compatible with conservation objectives, supporting previous studies. Also, our results support the hypothesis that the MUS, throughout a balanced integration of traditional and alternative activities, is a mechanism to enhance household resilience in terms of income and food availability, as it reduces variability and increases the resistance to some disturbances.

A prominent computational model of these processes is Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM), a variable-order Markov model that learns by internalizing n-grams from training sequences. However, PPM has limitations as a cognitive model: in particular, it has a perfect memory that weights all historic observations equally, which is inconsistent with memory capacity constraints and recency effects observed in human cognition. We address these limitations with PPM-Decay, a new variant of PPM that introduces a customizable memory decay kernel. In three studies - one with artificially generated sequences, one with chord sequences from Western music, and one with new behavioral data from an auditory pattern detection experiment - we show how this decay kernel improves the models predictive performance for sequences whose underlying statistics change over time, and enables the model to capture effects of memory constraints on auditory pattern detection. The resulting model is available in our new open-source R package, ppm (https://github.com/pmcharrison/ppm).","NA"

Although many molecular details of the modulation of ER transcriptional activity have been discovered including the impact of receptor plasma membrane localization and its relative E2-evoked signalling, the knowledge of real-time ER transcriptional dynamics in living cells is lacking. Here, we report the generation of MCF-7 and HeLa cells stably expressing a modified luciferase under the control of an E2-sensitive promoter, which activity can be continuously monitored in living cells and show that E2 induces a linear increase in ER transcriptional activity. Ligand-independent (e.g., epidermal growth factor) receptor activation was also detected in a time-dependent manner. Kinetic profiles of ER transcriptional activity measured in the presence of both receptor antagonists and inhibitors of ER plasma membrane localization reveals a biphasic dynamic of receptor behaviour underlying novel aspects of receptor-regulated transcriptional effects. Finally, analysis of the rate of the dose-dependent E2 induction of ER transcriptional activity demonstrates that low doses of E2 induce an effect identical to that determined by high concentrations of E2 as a function of the duration of hormone administration. Overall, we present the characterization of sensitive stable cell lines where to study the kinetic of E2 transcriptional signaling and to identify new aspects of ER function in different physiological or pathophysiological conditions.","10.1002/jcp.29565"

ESWT can promote different biological responses such as proliferation, migration, and regenerations of cells. Recent studies have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) secrete factors that enhance the regeneration of tissues, stimulate proliferation and differentiation of cells and decrease inflammatory and immune-reactions. Clinically, the combination of these two therapies has been used as a treatment for tendon and ligament lesions in horses; however, there is no scientific evidence supporting this combination of therapies in vivo. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to evaluate the effects of ESWT on equine umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stromal cells (CB-MSCs) proliferative, metabolic, migrative, differentiation, and immunomodulatory properties in vitro. Three equine CB-MSC cultures from independent donors were treated using an electrohydraulic shock wave generator attached to a water bath. All experiments were performed as triplicates. Proliferation, viability, migration and immunomodulatory properties of the cells were evaluated. Equine CB-MSCs were induced to evaluate their trilineage differentiation potential. ESWT treated cells had increased metabolic activity, showed positive adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation, and showed higher potential for differentiation towards the adipogenic and osteogenic cell fates. ESWT treated cells showed similar immunomodulatory properties to none-ESWT treated cells. Equine CB-MSCs are responsive to ESWT treatment and showed increased metabolic, adipogenic and osteogenic activity, but unaltered immunosuppressive properties. In vivo studies are warranted to determine if synergistic effects occur in the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries if ESWT and equine CB-MSC therapies are combined.","NA"

Mouse melanopsins Carboxy-terminus (C-terminus) possesses 38 serine and threonine residues, which can potentially serve as phosphorylation sites for a G-protein Receptor Kinase (GRK) and be involved in the deactivation of signal transduction. Previous studies suggest that S388, T389, S391, S392, S394, S395 on the proximal region of the C-terminus of mouse melanopsin are necessary for melanopsin deactivation. We expressed a series of mouse melanopsin C-terminal mutants in HEK293 cells and using calcium imaging, and we found that the necessary cluster of six serine and threonine residues, while being critical, are insufficient for proper melanopsin deactivation. Interestingly, the additional six serine and threonine residues adjacent to the required six sites, in either proximal or distal direction, are capable of restoring wild-type deactivation of melanopsin. These findings suggest an element of plasticity in the molecular basis of melanopsin phosphorylation and deactivation. In addition, C-terminal chimeric mutants and molecular modeling studies support the idea that the initial steps of deactivation and {beta}-arrestin binding are centered around these critical phosphorylation sites (S388-S395). This degree of functional versatility could help explain the diverse ipRGC light responses as well as non-image and image forming behaviors, even though all six sub types of ipRGCs express the same melanopsin gene OPN4.","10.1371/journal.pone.0228121"

Mechanical signals in biology change quickly over time and are often embedded in noise; however, the mechanics of force-sensing proteins have only been tested using simple force protocols, such as constant or ramped forces. Here, using our magnetic tape head tweezers design, we measure the folding dynamics of single talin proteins in response to mechanical noise and cyclic force perturbations. Our experiments demonstrate that talin filters out mechanical noise but detects periodic force signals over a finely-tuned frequency range. Hence, talin operates as a mechanical bandpass filter, able to read and interpret frequency-dependent mechanical information through its folding dynamics. We describe our observations in the context of stochastic resonance, which we propose as a mechanism by which mechanosensing proteins could respond accurately to force signals in the naturally noisy biological environment.","NA"

Recurrent somatic mutations of splicing factor genes are relatively uncommon in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML, < 20%). We examined whether RNA splicing differences exist in AML even in the absence of splicing factor mutations. Analyzing RNA-seq data from two independent cohorts of AML patients, we identified recurrent differential alternative splicing between patients with poor and good prognosis. These alternative splicing events occurred even in patients without any discernible splicing factor mutations. The alternative splicing events recurrently occurred in genes involved in specific molecular functions, primarily related to protein translation. Developing informatics tools to predict the functional impact of alternative splicing on the translated protein, we discovered that ~45% of the splicing events directly affected highly conserved protein domains. Several splicing factors were themselves misspliced in patients, and the splicing of their target transcripts were also altered. By studying differential gene expression in the same patients, we identified that alternative splicing of protein translation genes in ELNAdv patients resulted in the induction of an integrated stress response and up- regulation of inflammation-related genes. Lastly, using machine learning techniques, we identified a set of four genes whose alternative splicing can refine the accuracy of existing risk prognosis schemes and validated it in a completely independent cohort. Our discoveries therefore identify aberrant alternative splicing as a molecular feature of adverse AML with clinical relevance.","NA"

Proposed drivers of regime shifts include changes in grazing, spatial clustering, and ocean temperature. Here we distill the dynamic regimes of coral-macroalgal interaction into a three-dimensional geometry, akin to thermodynamic phase diagrams of state transitions, to facilitate analysis. Specific regime-shifting forces can be understood as bifurcation vectors through the cubic regime geometry. This geometric perspective allows us to understand multiple forces simultaneously in terms of the stability and persistence of interacting species. For example, in a coral-macroalgae community, grazing on macroalgae can lead to alternative stable states when there is no spatial clustering (e.g., high habitat connectivity). However, with spatial clustering, grazing can lead to coexistence because of elevated local intraspecific competition. The geometrical analysis of regime shifts is applicable to any two-species communities and can help conservation efforts navigate complexity and abrupt changes.","NA"

Because dysregulation of the receptor-chemokine system leads to inflammation and cancer, both chemokines and receptors are highly sought therapeutic targets. Yet one of the barriers for their therapeutic targeting is the limited understanding of the structural principles behind receptor-chemokine recognition and selectivity. The existing structures do not include CXC subfamily complexes and lack information about the receptor distal N-termini, despite the importance of the latter in signaling, regulation, and bias. Here we report the discovery of the geometry of the complex between full-length CXCR4, a prototypical CXC receptor and driver of cancer metastasis, and its endogenous ligand CXCL12. By comprehensive disulfide crosslinking, we establish the existence and the structure of a novel interface between the CXCR4 distal N-terminus and CXCL12 {beta}1-strand, while also recapitulating earlier findings from NMR, modeling and crystallography of homologous receptors. A crosslinking-informed high-resolution model of the CXCR4-CXCL12 complex pinpoints the interaction determinants and reveals the occupancy of the receptor major subpocket by the CXCL12 proximal N-terminus. This newly found positioning of the chemokine proximal N-terminus provides a structural explanation of CXC receptor-chemokine selectivity against other subfamilies. Our findings challenge the traditional two-site understanding of receptor-chemokine recognition, suggest the possibility of new affinity and signaling determinants, and fill a critical void on the structural map of an important class of therapeutic targets. These results will aid the rational design of selective chemokine-receptor-targeting small molecules and biologics with novel pharmacology.","10.1371/journal.pbio.3000656"

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are well known to support tumorigenesis and are emerging as immune modulators. While many leukocyte populations are well studied in cancer, neutrophils have received less attention. Neutrophils can release histone-bound nuclear DNA and cytotoxic granules as extracellular traps (NETs) in a process termed NETosis. Here, we show that CAFs induce formation of NETs both within the tumor microenvironment and at systemic levels in the blood and bone marrow. These tumor-induced NETs (t-NETs) are driven by a ROS-mediated pathway dependent on PAD4 and CD11b. Remarkably, CAF-derived Amyloid {beta} was identified as the key factor driving t-NETosis, a protein with significance in both neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders. Therapeutic inhibition of NETs in established tumors prevented growth, skewing neutrophils to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Reciprocally, t-NETs enhanced CAF activation phenotypes. Mirroring murine observations, NETs were detected juxtaposed to CAFs in human melanoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and elevated expression of amyloid and {beta}-Secretase correlated with poor prognosis. In summary, we report the existence of cross-talk between CAFs and neutrophils within the tumour microenvironment whereby CAF-induced t-NETosis supports cancer progression, identifying Amyloid {beta} as the protagonist and potential therapeutic target.

SignificanceThis study defines the existence of a pro-tumor immunomodulatory function of the stroma showing the induction of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps through CAF-derived Amyloid {beta}.

Birdsong is an excellent model system for understanding sequence learning of complex fine motor skills [3], but we know surprisingly little how the motor pool controlling the syrinx is organized [4] and how MU recruitment drives changes in vocal output [5]. Here we combine measurements of syringeal muscle innervation ratios with muscle stress and an in vitro syrinx preparation to estimate MU size distribution and the control resolution of fundamental frequency (fo), a key vocal parameter, in zebra finches. We show that syringeal muscles have extremely small MUs, with 50% innervating [&le;] 3, and 13 - 17% innervating a single muscle fiber. Combined with the lowest specific stress (5 mN/mm2) known to skeletal vertebrate muscle, small force steps by the major fo controlling muscle provide control of 50 mHz to 4.2 Hz steps per MU. We show that the song system has the highest motor control resolution possible in the vertebrate nervous system and suggest this evolved due to strong selection on fine gradation of vocal output.

Host immunity is essential for bacterial clearance and an appropriate healing response, and recent evidence has suggested an association between orthopedic trauma and systemic immune dysregulation and immunosuppression. However, the impact of a local infection on this systemic immune response and subsequent effects on the local response is poorly understood and has not been a major focus for addressing orthopedic injuries and infections. Therefore, this study utilized a model of orthopedic biomaterial-associated infection to investigate the effects of infection on the long-term immune response. Here, despite persistence of a local, indolent infection lacking outward symptoms, there was still evidence of long-term immune dysregulation with systemic increases in MDSCs and decreases in T cells compared to non-infected trauma. Further, the trauma only group exhibited a regulated and coordinated systemic cytokine response, which was not present in the infected trauma group. Locally, the infection group had attenuated macrophage infiltration in the local soft tissue compared to the non-infected group.

Besides their use as biological control agents against agricultural pests, some Photorhabdus species are also a source of natural products and are of medical interest due to their ability to cause tissue infections and subcutaneous lesions in humans. Given the diversity of Photorhabdus species, rapid and reliable methods to resolve this genus to the species level are needed. In this study, we evaluated the potential of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the identification of Photorhabdus species. To this end, we established a collection of 54 isolates consisting of type strains and multiple field strains that belong to each of the validly described species and subspecies of this genus. Reference spectra for the strains were generated and used to complement a currently available database. The extended reference database was then used for identification based on the direct transfer sample preparation method and protein fingerprint of single colonies. High discrimination of distantly related species was observed. However, lower discrimination was observed with some of the most closely related species and subspecies. Our results, therefore, suggest that MALDI-TOF MS can be used to correctly identify Photorhabdus strains at the genus and species level, but has limited resolution power for closely related species and subspecies. Our study demonstrates the suitability and limitations of MALDI-TOF-based identification methods for the assessment of the taxonomical position and identification of Photorhabdus isolates.

Under natural conditions, these bacteria are often observed infecting soil-associated arthropods, but under certain circumstances, can also infect humans. They produce a large variety of natural products including antibiotics, insecticides, and polyketide pigments that have substantial agricultural, biotechnological and medical potential. In this study, we implement MALDI-TOF MS-based identification method to resolve the taxonomic identity of this bacterial genus, providing thereby a rapid identification tool to understanding its taxonomic diversity to boost scientific progress in medical, agricultural, and biotechnological settings.","NA"

Additionally, there is a lack of consensus and contradictory information along the recent years that limits a comprehensive understanding of its central carbon metabolism, mainly due to a lack of physiological studies in controlled and monitored environments. Moreover, there is controversy about the diversity in the culture conditions (media composition, temperature and pH among others) used by different groups, which makes it complicated when trying to get significant conclusions and behavioral patterns.

In this work, we present for the first time a complete physiological characterization of D. hansenii in batch cultivations, in highly instrumented and controlled lab-scale bioreactors.

Hfq is an RNA-binding protein present in diverse bacterial lineages and contributes to many different aspects of RNA metabolism. We demonstrate that Hfq forms a distinct and reversible focus-like structure in E. coli specifically experiencing long-term nitrogen (N) starvation. Using the ability of T7 phage to replicate in N starved bacteria as a biological probe of E. coli cell function during N starvation, we demonstrate that Hfq foci have a role in the adaptive response to long-term N starvation. We further show that Hfq foci formation does not depend on gene expression during N starvation and occurs independently of the N regulatory protein C (NtrC) activated initial adaptive response to N starvation. The results serve as a paradigm to demonstrate that bacterial adaptation to long-term nutrient starvation can be spatiotemporally coordinated and can occur independently of de novo gene expression during starvation.

Significance StatementBacteria have evolved complex strategies to cope with conditions of nitrogen (N) adversity. We now reveal a role for a widely studied RNA binding protein, Hfq, in the processes involved in how Escherichia coli copes with N starvation. We demonstrate that Hfq forms a distinct and reversible focus-like structure in long-term N starved E. coli. We provide evidence to suggest that the Hfq foci are important features required for adjusting E. coli cell function during N starvation for optimal adaptation to long-term N starvation.

Our results show that Cul3 haploinsufficient mice exhibit deficits in motor coordination as well as ASD-relevant social and cognitive impairments. Cul3 mutant brain displays cortical lamination abnormalities due to defective neuronal migration and reduced numbers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In line with the observed abnormal columnar organization, Cul3 haploinsufficiency is associated with decreased spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory activity in the cortex. At the molecular level, employing a quantitative proteomic approach, we show that Cul3 regulates cytoskeletal and adhesion protein abundance in mouse embryos. Abnormal regulation of cytoskeletal proteins in Cul3 mutant neuronal cells results in atypical organization of the actin mesh at the cell leading edge, likely causing the observed migration deficits. In contrast to these important functions early in development, Cul3 deficiency appears less relevant at adult stages. In fact, induction of Cul3 haploinsufficiency in adult mice does not result in the behavioral defects observed in constitutive Cul3 haploinsufficient animals.

While clinical data has been useful in identifying similarities in the neurobiological bases of these disorders, preclinical models are essential for understanding the mechanism(s) by which PTSD increases the risk of developing AUD. The purpose of these studies was to examine if exposure of male Long-Evans rats to the synthetically produced predator odor 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT) would increase alcohol self-administration, potentially by facilitating transfer of salience towards cues, and alter neuronal response to alcohol as measured by the immediate early gene c-Fos. In Experiment 1 rats exposed to repeated (4x) TMT showed reductions in goal-tracking behavior in Pavlovian conditioned approach, and increases in alcohol self-administration. In Experiment 2 rats exposed to repeated TMT showed blunted basolateral amygdala c-Fos response to alcohol, and increased correlation between medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala subregions. In Experiment 3 rats exposed to single, but not repeated TMT showed increases in alcohol self-administration, and no change in anxiety-like behavior or hyperarousal. In Experiment 4, rats showed no habituation of corticosterone response after 4 TMT exposures. In summary, exposure of male rats to TMT can cause escalations in alcohol self-administration, reductions in goal-tracking behavior, and reduction in BLA response to alcohol.

Despite its many practical uses, the mechanism of MAP signal generation and the reason it is so different from unipolar recordings is not completely known and is a matter of controversy. It is hypothesized that partial depolarization of the cells directly underneath the electrode contributes to the generation of MAP signals. In this paper, we describe a parametric, semi-quantitative method to generate realistic MAP and intermediate forms - multiphasic electrograms different from an ideal MAP - that does not require the partial depolarization hypothesis. The key ideas of our method are the formation of junctional spaces, i.e., electrically isolated pockets between the surface of an electrode and tissue, and the presence of a complex network of passive components that acts as a high-pass filter to distort the signal that reaches the recording amplifier. The passive network is formed by the interaction between the passive tissue properties and the double-layer capacitance of electrodes. We show that it is possible to generate different electrograms by the change of the model parameters and that both the MAP and intermediate forms reside on a continuum of signals. Our model helps to decipher the mechanisms of signal generation and can lead to a better design for electrodes, recording amplifiers, and experimental setups.

SIGNIFICANCERecording the Monophasic Action Potential (MAP) is potentially very useful in both experimental and clinical cardiac electrophysiology and can provide valuable information about the repolarization phase of the action potential. However, despite its benefits, it currently has only a small and niche role. The main challenge is the technical difficulties of recording an ideal MAP. Our results provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of the generation of cardiac electrograms and may help to optimize experiments and improve tools to achieve the full potentials of recording the MAP signals.","NA"

In the primary nucleus, membrane ruptures are rapidly repaired but the mechanisms are still unclear. Here we show that BAF, a nuclear envelope protein that shapes chromatin and recruits additional NE proteins in mitosis, also facilitates nuclear membrane repair in interphase, in part through recruitment of the nuclear membrane proteins emerin and LEMD2 to rupture sites. Using a cancer cell line depleted of lamin B1 to drive membrane rupture, we confirmed that GFP-BAF accumulates at rupture sites and found that BAF depletion increased the duration of nucleus integrity loss after rupture, with the largest effects being on longer ruptures. This phenotype could be rescued by WT BAF, but not by a mutant lacking the LEM-protein binding domain. Depletion of LEMD2 or emerin, but not lamin A/C, was sufficient to significantly increase the proportion of long ruptures, consistent with LEM-protein binding being a key function of BAF during membrane repair. Overall our results suggest a membrane repair model where BAF facilitates the repair of large membrane ruptures, in part by recruiting transmembrane nuclear envelope proteins, but where small ruptures are repaired by a BAF-independent mechanism.","NA"

In prostate organoid culture from basal cells, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) antagonizes R-spondin-stimulated organoid growth in a concentration-dependent manner. Molecular analyses of organoids under different treatment conditions showed that androgen signaling down-regulated the expressions of a Wnt reporter as well as many Wnt target genes.

While key inductive signaling pathways within competent cells are well-described at a molecular level, the mechanisms by which tissues lose responsiveness to inductive signals are not well understood. Localized activation of Wnt signaling before zygotic gene activation in Xenopus laevis leads to dorsal development, but competence to induce dorsal genes in response to Wnts is lost by the late blastula stage. We hypothesize that loss of competence is mediated by changes in histone modifications leading to a loss of chromatin accessibility at the promoters of Wnt target genes. We use ATAC-seq to evaluate genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility across several developmental stages. Based on overlap with p300 binding, we identify thousands of putative cis-regulatory elements at the gastrula stage, including sites that lose accessibility by the end of gastrulation and are enriched for pluripotency factor binding motifs. Dorsal Wnt target gene promoters are not accessible after the loss of competence in the early gastrula while genes involved in mesoderm and neural crest development maintain accessibility at their promoters. Inhibition of histone deacetylases increases acetylation at the promoters of dorsal Wnt target genes and extends competence for dorsal gene induction by Wnt signaling. Histone deacetylase inhibition, however, is not sufficient to extend competence for mesoderm or neural crest induction. These data suggest that chromatin state regulates the loss of competence to inductive signals in a context-dependent manner.","10.1016/j.ydbio.2020.02.013"

Applications of band ratio measures include investigations of cognitive processes as well as biomarkers for conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Band ratio measures are typically interpreted as reflecting quantitative measures of periodic, or oscillatory, activity, which implicitly assumes that a ratio is measuring the relative powers of two distinct periodic components that are well captured by predefined frequency ranges. However, electrophysiological signals contain periodic components and a 1/f-like aperiodic component, which contributes power across all frequencies. In this work, we investigate whether band ratio measures reflect power differences between two oscillations, as intended. We examine to what extent ratios may instead reflect other periodic changes--such as in center frequency or bandwidth--and/or aperiodic activity. We test this first in simulation, exploring how band ratio measures relate to changes in multiple spectral features. In simulation, we show how multiple periodic and aperiodic features affect band ratio measures. We then validate these findings in a large electroencephalography (EEG) dataset, comparing band ratio measures to parameterizations of power spectral features. In EEG, we find that multiple disparate features influence ratio measures. For example, the commonly applied theta / beta ratio is most reflective of differences in aperiodic activity, and not oscillatory theta or beta power. Collectively, we show how periodic and aperiodic features can drive the same observed changes in band ratio measures. Our results demonstrate how ratio measures reflect different features in different contexts, inconsistent with their typical interpretations. We conclude that band ratio measures are non-specific, conflating multiple possible underlying spectral changes. Explicit parameterization of neural power spectra is better able to provide measurement specificity, elucidating which components of the data change in what ways, allowing for more appropriate physiological interpretations.

While the limiting pool model ensures organelle size scaling with cell size, it does not provide a mechanism for robust size control of multiple co-existing structures. Here we propose a kinetic theory for size regulation of multiple structures that are assembled from a shared pool of subunits. We demonstrate that a negative feedback between the growth rate and the size of individual structures underlies size regulation of a wide variety of intracellular assemblies, from cytoskeletal filaments to three-dimensional organelles such as centrosomes and the nucleus. We identify the feedback motifs for size control in these structures, based on known molecular interactions, and quantitatively compare our theory with available experimental data. Furthermore, we show that a positive feedback between structure size and growth rate can lead to bistable size distributions arising from autocatalytic growth. In the limit of high subunit concentration, autocatalytic growth of multiple structures leads to stochastic selection of a single structure, elucidating a mechanism for polarity establishment.","NA"

We find that G0 cells have a denser nucleoplasm and fewer chromatin-associated multi-megadalton globular complexes (megacomplexes) than proliferating cells.

Here, we describe a novel mode of regulation within this circuit involving a spatial dependence of the relative phase between cAMP, PKA, and Ca2+. We show that nanodomain clustering of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases drives oscillations of local cAMP levels to be precisely in-phase with Ca2+ oscillations, whereas Ca2+-sensitive phosphodiesterases maintain out-of-phase oscillations outside of the nanodomain, representing a striking example and novel mechanism of cAMP compartmentation. Disruption of this precise in-phase relationship perturbs Ca2+ oscillations, suggesting that the relative phase within an oscillatory circuit can encode specific functional information. This example of a signaling nanodomain utilized for localized tuning of an oscillatory circuit has broad implications for the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling networks.","NA"

The Arl4c signaling cascade starts by the recruitment of the Arf-GEF cytohesins to the plasma membrane, which in turn engage the small GTPase Arf6. In the nervous system, Arf6 regulates dendrite outgrowth in vitro and neuronal migration in the developing cortex. However, the role of Arl4c-cytohesin-Arf6 signaling during brain development and particularly during hippocampal development remain elusive. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin 5/Rbx2 (CRL5) controls the stability of Arl4c and its signaling effectors to regulate hippocampal morphogenesis. Rbx2 knock out causes hippocampal pyramidal neuron mislocalization and formation of multiple apical dendrites. The same phenotypes were observed when Cullin 5 was knocked down in pyramidal neurons by in utero electroporation. We used quantitative mass spectrometry to show that Arl4c, Cytohesin-1/3, and Arf6 accumulate in the telencephalon when Rbx2 is absent. Arl4c expression is post-transcriptionally regulated, with a peak in expression at early postnatal stages, and is localized at the plasma membrane and on intracellular vesicles in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, we show that depletion of Arl4c rescues the phenotypes caused by Cullin 5 knock down in the hippocampus, whereas depletion of Arf6 exacerbates over-migration. Finally, we show that Arl4c and Arf6 are necessary for the dendritic outgrowth of pyramidal neurons to the most superficial strata of the hippocampus. Overall, we identified CRL5 as a key regulator of hippocampal development and uncovered Arl4c and Arf6 as novel CRL5-regulated signaling effectors that control pyramidal neuron migration and dendritogenesis.","NA"

Tonic signals, in the form of adipose tissue-derived adipokines, set the baseline level of energy-sensing neuron activity, providing context for interpretation of phasic messages. However, the mechanism by which tonic adipokine information establishes baseline neuronal function is unclear. Here we show that Upd2, a Drosophila Leptin ortholog, regulates actin-based synapse reorganization by reducing inhibitory synaptic contacts, thereby providing a permissive neural tone for insulin release under conditions of nutrient surplus. Unexpectedly, Insulin acts on the same upstream inhibitory neurons to conversely increase synapse number, hence re-instating negative tone.

In this study, we sought to determine whether there is evidence of gender bias in the citation practices of neuroscientists. Using data from five top neuroscience journals, we find that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than would be expected if gender were not a factor in referencing. Importantly, we show that this overcitation of men and undercitation of women is driven largely by the citation practices of men, and is increasing over time as the field becomes more diverse.

Human carriers of mutations in the metal transporter ZIP14 and whole-body Zip14 KO (WB-KO) mice display similar phenotypes, including spontaneous systemic and brain Mn overload, and motor dysfunction. Initially, it was believed that Mn accumulation due to ZIP14 mutations caused by impaired hepatobiliary Mn elimination. However, liver-specific Zip14 KO mice (L-KO) did not show systemic Mn accumulation or motor deficits. ZIP14 is highly expressed in the small intestine and is localized to the basolateral surface of enterocytes. Thus we hypothesized that basolaterally-localized ZIP14 in enterocytes provides another route for elimination of Mn. Using wild type and intestine-specific ZIP14 KO (I-KO) mice, we have shown that ablation of intestinal Zip14 is sufficient to cause systemic and brain Mn accumulation. The lack of intestinal ZIP14- mediated Mn excretion was compensated for by the hepatobiliary system; however, it was not sufficient to maintain Mn homeostasis. When supplemented with extra dietary Mn, I-KO mice displayed some motor dysfunctions, brain Mn accumulation based on both MRI imaging and chemical analysis, thus demonstrating the importance of intestinal ZIP14 as a route of Mn excretion. A defect in intestinal Zip14 expresssion likely could contribute to the Parkinson-like Mn accumulation of manganism.

Because sex steroid hormones can impact sex determination in TSD reptiles, variation in their maternal transfer within the egg yolk may form a buffer mechanism against raising temperatures. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the effect of maternal oestradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) on offspring sex in a threatened TSD population of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). Circulating levels of E2 and T in nesting females, in egg yolks at oviposition and in neonates were measured. Immediately after oviposition, nests were relocated into an in situ experimental hatchery where temperatures were controlled by standardising the incubation depth. We used affinity propagation clustering on hormone profiles guided by incubation duration, to sex individuals from these nests in a non-lethal manner, offering a novel conservation tool for this endangered species. Despite standardised temperatures, we found a large level of variation in the sex ratio of clutches, which correlated in a non-linear manner with maternal investment of the E2:T ratio in egg yolks.

Mutations in proteins of SWI/SNF complexes occur in 20% of human cancers including ovarian cancer (OC). Approximately 50% of ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) carries mutations in the SWI/SNF subunit ARID1A while small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is driven primarily by genetic inactivation of the SWI/SNF ATPase SMARCA4 (BRG1) alongside epigenetic silencing of the homolog ATPase SMARCA2 (BRM). Dual loss of these ATPases disrupts SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling activity and may also interfere with the function of other histone-modifying enzymes that associate with or are dependent on SWI/SNF activity. One such enzyme is lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A) which regulates the chromatin landscape and gene expression by demethylating proteins, including histone H3. LSD1 associates with epigenetic complexes such as the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase complex (NuRD) and SWI/SNF to inhibit the transcription of genes involved in tumor suppression and cell differentiation. TGCA analysis of human cancers shows that LSD1 is highly expressed in SWI/SNF-mutated tumors. Further, SCCOHT and OCCC cell lines show low nM IC50s for the reversible LSD1 inhibitor SP-2577 (Seclidemstat, currently in clinical phase I trials), supporting that these SWI/SNF-deficient ovarian cancers are dependent on LSD1 activity. Recently, it has been also shown that inhibition of LSD1 stimulates interferon (IFN)-dependent anti-tumor immunity through induction of Endogenous Retroviruses Elements (ERVs) and may thereby overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade. Additionally, SCCOHTs have been shown to exhibit an immune-active tumor microenvironment with PD-L1 expression in both tumor and stromal cells that strongly correlated with T cell infiltration. Thus, in this study we investigated the ability of SP-2577 to promote anti-tumor immunity and T cell infiltration in SWI/SNF-mutant SCCOHT and OCCC models. Our data shows that the reversible LSD1 inhibitor SP-2577 stimulates IFN-dependent anti-tumor immunity in SCCOHT cells in vitro in a 3D immune-organoid platform. Additionally, SP-2577 promoted the expression of PD-L1 in both SCCOHT and OCCC models. Together our findings suggest that SP-2577 and checkpoint inhibitors as a therapeutic combination may induce or augment immunogenic responses in these tumors.","NA"

CMs can be considered the earliest detectable manifestations of photocarcinogenesis. Systematic evaluation of CMs is crucial to understand early photo-carcinogenesis. Differences between CMs in sun-exposed (SE) and non-SE (NE) areas are unknown. To address these problems, we developed a robust method to quantitatively measure CMs in skin using targeted (5,500bp), ultra-deep (64,730X median coverage), high-throughput sequencing in 450 matched SE and NE epidermal punch biopsies obtained from clinically normal skin (n=13 individuals). In total we identified 638 mutations including 298 UV-signature mutations (USMs). SE samples showed 3-fold higher rate of USM and higher USM variant allele frequencies than NE. We identified areas in TP53, NOTCH1 and GRM3 where mutation burden was significantly associated with UV-exposure. Six mutations were almost exclusively present in SE epidermis and accounted for 42% of the overall difference between SE and NE mutation burden. Cumulative Relative Clonal Area (CRCA) was defined as the overall relative percentage of the sampled skin area affected by CM. UV-induced DNA damage is a clinically relevant criterion and CRCA is a single metric of UV-damage. CRCA was dramatically elevated (mean = 11.2 fold) in SE samples compared to NE. This study represents the first analysis of clonogenic mutations in SE and NE human skin. The findings unveiled previously unknown patterns of early mutations introduced by UV exposure.

Significance statementIn UV radiation exposed skin, mutations fuel clonal cell growth. We established a sequencing-based method to objectively assess the mutational differences between sun-exposed and non-sun-exposed areas of normal human skin. Striking differences, in both the numbers of mutations and variant allele frequencies, were found between sun-exposed and -protected areas. Furthermore, we identified specific genomic regions where mutation burden is significantly associated with UV-exposure status. These findings revealed previously unknown mutational patterns associated with UV-exposure, providing important insights into UV radiations early carcinogenic effects.

Recent evidence suggests that prediction and prevention challenges may be aided by discoveries of genetic risk factors. Here we focus on the role of rare (MAF <1%), putatively functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in suicide death using the large genetic resources available in the Utah Suicide Genetic Risk Study (USGRS). We conducted a single-variant association analysis of 30,377 rare putatively functional SNPs present on the PsychArray genotyping array in 2,672 USGRS suicides of non-Finnish European (NFE) ancestry and 51,583 publicly available NFE controls from gnomAD, with additional follow-up analyses using an independent control sample of 21,324 NFE controls from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. SNPs underwent rigorous quality control, and among SNPs meeting significance thresholds, we considered only those that were validated in sequence data. We identified five novel, high-impact, rare SNPs with significant associations with suicide death (SNAPC1, rs75418419; TNKS1BP1, rs143883793; ADGRF5, rs149197213; PER1, rs145053802; and ESS2, rs62223875). Both PER1 and SNAPC1 have other supporting gene-level evidence of suicide risk, and an association with bipolar disorder has been reported for PER1 and with schizophrenia for PER1, TNKS1BP1, and ESS2. Three genes (PER1, TNKS1BP1, and ADGRF5), with additional genes implicated by GWAS studies on suicidal behavior, showed significant enrichment in immune system, homeostatic and signal transduction processes. Pain, depression, and accidental trauma were the most prevalent phenotypes in electronic medical record data for the categories assessed. These findings suggest an important role for rare variants in suicide risk and provide new insights into the genetic architecture of suicide death. Furthermore, we demonstrate the added utility of careful assessment of genotyping arrays in rare variant discovery.","NA"

Genomic regions of recombining or reassorting pathogens often originate and evolve at different times and locations, which characterised their unique spatial histories. Measuring the extent of these differences requires new methods to compare geographic information on phylogenetic trees reconstructed from different parts of the genome. Here we develop for the first time a set of measures of phylogeographic incompatibility aimed at detecting differences between geographical histories in terms of distances between phylogeographies. We study the effect of varying demography and recombination on phylogeographic incompatibilities using coalescent simulations. We further apply these measures to the evolutionary history of human and livestock pathogens, either reassorting or recombining, such as the Victoria and Yamagata lineages of influenza B and the O/Ind-2001 foot-and-mouth disease virus strain.

A.","John A. Capra","Vanderbilt University","2020-01-11",1,"cc_by_nd","new results","genomics","BackgroundTopologically associating domains (TADs) are fundamental units of three-dimensional (3D) nuclear organization. The regions bordering TADs--TAD boundaries-- regulate gene expression by restricting interactions of cis-regulatory sequences to their target genes. TAD and TAD boundary disruption have been implicated in rare disease pathogenesis; however, we have a limited framework for integrating cross-cell-type TAD maps into the study of genome evolution and interpretation of common trait-associated variants. Here, we investigate an unexplored attribute of 3D genome architecture--the stability of TAD boundaries across cell types--and demonstrate its relevance to understanding how genetic variation in TADs contributes to complex disease.

ResultsBy synthesizing TAD maps across 37 diverse cell types with multiple annotations and 41 genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we investigate the differences in function and evolutionary constraint between TADs versus TAD boundaries. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries are more evolutionarily constrained than TADs. We find that boundaries are enriched for disease heritability, especially for immunologic, hematologic, and metabolic traits. Next, we stratify boundaries by their stability across cell types and show that more than 30% of boundaries are unique to a specific tissue. Compared to these unique boundaries, cell-type-stable boundaries are enriched for CTCF binding, evolutionary constraint, housekeeping genes, and trait heritability, suggesting greater functional importance.

ConclusionsCell-type-stable TAD boundaries have greater sequence-level constraint and complex trait heritability enrichment than cell-type-unique boundaries and TADs overall. Thus, considering TAD and boundary stability across cell types provides valuable context for understanding the genomes functional landscape and enabling 3D-structural aware variant interpretation.","NA"

Y.-W.; Fraser, G. M.","Gillian M Fraser","University of Cambridge","2020-01-11",1,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","microbiology","Bacterial flagella are assembled from thousands of protein subunits that are unfolded and exported across the cell membrane by a specialized flagellar Type III Secretion System (fT3SS). Export of subunit cargo is fuelled by the proton motive force (pmf), facilitated by an export ATPase that is evolutionarily related to the F1 ATPase. The FliJ stalk component of the ATPase binds the flagellar export gate, enabling it to utilise the pmf electric potential ({Delta}{Psi}) to drive efficient export of subunit cargo. What is unclear is how FliJ activation of the export gate is regulated to prevent constitutive proton influx and wasteful dissipation of pmf when no subunit cargo is available. FliJ, in addition to activating the export gate, recruits unladen export chaperones and transfers them to cognate subunit cargo, creating a local cycle of chaperone-subunit binding and release at the fT3SS. To investigate whether chaperones might regulate FliJ activation of the export gate, we isolated chaperone variants that were defective for FliJ binding yet still able to bind cognate subunits and other export components. Disruption of the chaperone-FliJ interaction attenuated motility and cognate subunit export. In vitro and in vivo competitive binding assays showed that chaperones and the export gate component FlhA compete for binding FliJ. Our data indicate that unladen chaperones, which would be present in the cell when subunit levels are low, sequester FliJ to prevent activation of the export gate. This suggests a mechanism whereby chaperones couple availability of export cargo to utilization of pmf by the fT3SS.

SignificanceType III Secretion Systems (T3SS) are used by bacteria to build flagella, rotary nanomachines for cell motility, and related injectosomes, specialised molecular syringes that deliver bacterial effector proteins into host cells to subvert their function. T3SS activity uses two power sources - the high-energy ATP molecule and the proton motive force (pmf), chemical and electric potential stored in a proton gradient across the bacterial membrane. Here, we show that use of pmf by the flagellar T3SS is regulated by cytoplasmic chaperones that bind and deliver cargo proteins to the T3SS for export. We demonstrate that when cargo availability is low, the unladen chaperones bind the T3SS to reduce its activity, minimising energy use and preventing wasteful dissipation of the pmf.","NA"

We found that the surface proteome of resting A. fumigatus conidia is not static, but instead unexpectedly dynamic, as evidenced by drastically different surface proteomes under different growth conditions. Knockouts of two abundant A. fumigatus surface proteins, ScwA and CweA, were found to function only in fine-tuning the cell wall stress response, implying that the conidial surface is very robust against perturbations. We then compared the surface proteome of A. fumigatus to other allergy-inducing molds, including Alternaria alternata, Penicillium rubens, and Cladosporium herbarum, and performed comparative proteomics on resting and swollen conidia, as well as secreted proteins from germinating conidia. We detected 125 protein ortholog groups, including 80 with putative catalytic activity, in the extracellular region of all four molds, and 42 nonorthologous proteins produced solely by A. fumigatus.

Since its probable biological role has been proposed to be in DNA damage response, which is inflicted by reactive oxygen species (ROS), in the present study, we examined whether Msm Arr influences ROS levels. For this purpose, the levels of the ROS, hydroxyl radical and superoxide, were determined in the mid-log phase (MLP) cells of Msm arr knockout (arr-KO) strain, in comparison to those in the equivalently grown Msm arr+ wild-type (WT) strain. The MLP arr-KO cells generated significantly elevated levels of superoxide and hydroxyl radical, unlike the equivalently grown WT MLP cells. Complementation of arr-KO with arr, but not with empty vector, restored the ROS levels comparable to those in the WT strain. Elevated ROS levels in the arr-KO strain enabled selection of rifampicin-resistant mutants at 10-7 cfu/ml from the rifampicin-unexposed MLP cells of arr-KO, which is one-log10 higher than that for WT cells (10-8). Upon prolonged exposure to rifampicin, the susceptibility, persister formation, generation of elevated levels of hydroxyl radical by the persisters, rifampicin-resister generation frequency of the persisters and regrowth of the rifampicin-resistant mutants from the respective persisters were all comparable between the arr-KO and WT strains. These observations revealed that Arr influences ROS levels in the actively growing M. smegmatis cells but not in the rifampicin-exposed cells. We proposed the probable pathway through which Arr might be influencing ROS levels in the actively growing M. smegmatis cells.

IMPORTANCEDiverse genera of bacteria consisting of pathogens, opportunistic pathogens and non-pathogens, possess Arr-type activities that confer equally efficient rifampicin resistance, thereby posing serious health hazard. Acquisition of this function by other bacteria through horizontal gene transfer enhances the hazard posed by the bacteria possessing it. M. smegmatis is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes infections of skin and soft tissues. Moreover, M. smegmatis is a genetically tractable model organism for M. tuberculosis with the potential to function even as tuberculosis vaccine. In view of these significant aspects of Arr and M. smegmatis, the study to find out the natural physiological role of Arr in M. smegmatis, gains importance for designing strategies to prevent antibiotic inactivation and to target the cellular function to contain the bacterium. Above all, the three-dimensional structure of M. smegmatis Arr reveals significant structural homology with eukaryotic ADP-ribosyltransferases and bacterial toxins, thereby giving the study broad significance.","NA"

We have recently reported that chronic pain is associated with amplified activity of PB neurons in a rat model of neuropathic pain. Here we demonstrate that similar activity amplification occurs in mice, and that this is related to suppressed inhibition to PB neurons from the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Animals with pain after chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-Pain) displayed higher spontaneous and evoked activity in PB neurons, and a dramatic increase in after-discharges--responses that far outlast the stimulus--compared to controls. PB neurons in CCI-Pain animals showed a reduction in inhibitory, GABAergic inputs. We show that--in both rats and mice--PB contains few GABAergic neurons, and that most of its GABAergic inputs arise from CeA. These CeA GABA neurons express dynorphin, somatostatin and/or corticotropin releasing hormone. We find that the efficacy of this CeA-LPB pathway is suppressed in chronic pain. Further, optogenetically stimulating this pathway suppresses acute pain, and inhibiting it, in naive animals, evokes pain behaviors. These findings demonstrate that the CeA-LPB pathway is critically involved in pain regulation, and in the pathogenesis of chronic pain.

Significance StatementWe describe a novel pathway, consisting of inhibition by dynorphin, somatostatin and corticotropin-releasing hormone expressing neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala that project to the parabrachial nucleus (PB). We show that this pathway regulates the activity of pain-related neurons in PB, and that, in chronic pain, this inhibitory pathway is suppressed, and that this suppression is causally related to pain perception. We propose that this amygdalo-parabrachial pathway is a key regulator of both chronic and acute pain, and a novel target for pain relief.","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0075-20.2020"

Previous studies have shown tyrosine-derived polycarbonates (TyrPC) are versatile biomaterials with a wide range of tissue engineering applications across multiple disciplines. The library of TyrPC has been well studied and consists of thousands of polymer compositions with tunable mechanical characteristics and degradation and resorption rates that are useful for the design of nerve guidance tubes (NGTs). NGTs made of different TyrPCs have been used in segmental nerve defect models in small animals. The current study is an extension of this work and evaluates the effects of NGTs made using two different TyrPC compositions in a porcine model of peripheral nerve injury and repair. We first evaluated a nondegradable TyrPC formulation in a 1 cm segmental nerve defect model in pigs, demonstrating proof-of-concept of chronic regenerative efficacy up to 6 months, at which time nerve/muscle electrophysiology and nerve morphometry were similar to those attained by an autograft repair control. Next, we characterized the acute regenerative response to a degradable TyrPC formulation using the same 1 cm segmental defect model. After 2 weeks in vivo, this TyrPC NGT was found to promote the deposition by host cells of pro-regenerative extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents (in particular collagen I, collagen III, collagen IV, laminin and fibronectin) at levels exceeding those deposited inside commercially available collagen-based NGTs. This corresponded with dense and rapid infiltration of host Schwann cells and axons into the lumen of the NGT and axonal crossing of the lesion into the distal nerve segment. These findings confirmed results reported previously in a mouse model and reveal that TyrPC NGTs were well tolerated in swine and facilitated host axon regeneration and Schwann cell infiltration in the acute phase across segmental defects - likely by eliciting a favorable neurotrophic ECM milieu. This regenerative response ultimately can contribute to functional recovery.","NA"

While there is a wealth of data on the biological and biophysical properties of drugs and therapeutic compounds, there is a notable lack of similar data for compounds commonly present in food. Computational methods for high-throughput identification of food compounds with specific biological effects, especially when accompanied by relevant food composition data, could enable more effective and more personalized dietary planning. We have created a machine learning-based tool (PhyteByte) to leverage existing pharmacological data to predict bioactivity across a comprehensive molecular database of foods and food compounds.

ResultsPhyteByte uses a cheminformatic approach to structure-based activity prediction and applies it to uncover the putative bioactivity of food compounds. The tool takes an input protein target and develops a random forest classifier to predict the effect of an input molecule based on its molecular fingerprint, using structure and activity data available from the ChEMBL database. It then predicts the relevant bioactivity of a library of food compounds with known molecular structures from the FooDB database. The output is a list of food compounds with high confidence of eliciting relevant biological effects, along with their source foods and associated quantities in those foods, where available. Applying PhyteByte to the PPARG gene, we identified irigenin, sesamin, fargesin, and delta-sanshool as putative agonists of PPARG, along with previously identified agonists of this important metabolic regulator.

ConclusionsPhyteByte identifies food-based compounds that are predicted to interact with specific protein targets. The identified relationships can be used to prioritize food compounds for experimental or epidemiological follow-up and can contribute to the rapid development of precision approaches to new nutraceuticals as well as personalized dietary planning.","NA"

The application uses a fast k-mer matching algorithm to map pathogen WGS data to canonical SNPs contained in hierarchically structured schemas and assigns genotypes based on the detected SNP profile. Using modest computing resources, BioHansel efficiently types isolates from raw sequence reads or assembled contigs in a matter of seconds, making it attractive for use by public health, food safety, environmental, and agricultural authorities that wish to apply WGS methodologies for their surveillance, diagnostics, and research programs. BioHansel currently provides canonical SNP genotyping schemas for four prevalent Salmonella serovars--Typhi, Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Heidelberg--as well as a schema for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Users can also supply their own schemas for genotyping other organisms. BioHansels quality assurance system assesses the validity of the genotyping results and can identify low quality data, contaminated datasets, and misidentified organisms. BioHansel is targeted to support surveillance, source attribution, risk assessment, diagnostics, and rapid screening for public health purposes, such as product recalls. BioHansel is an open source application with packages available for PyPI, Conda, and the Galaxy workflow manager. In summary, BioHansel performs efficient, rapid, accurate, and high-resolution classification of bacterial genomes from sequence reads or assembled contigs on standard computing hardware. BioHansel is suitable for use as a general research tool as well as in fully operationalized WGS workflows at the front lines of infectious disease surveillance, diagnostics, and outbreak investigation and response.

Impact statementPublic health, food safety, environmental, and agricultural authorities are currently engaged in a global effort to incorporate whole genome sequencing technologies into their infectious disease research, surveillance, and outbreak investigation programs. Its widespread adoption, however, has been impeded by two major obstacles: the need for high performance computing to generate results and the expert knowledge required to interpret and communicate those results. BioHansel addresses these limitations by rapidly genotyping pathogens from whole genome sequence data in an accurate, simple, familiar, and easily sharable manner using standard computing resources. BioHansel provides a compact and readily interpretable genotype based on canonical SNP genotyping schemas. BioHansels genotyping nomenclature encodes the pathogens position in its population structure, which simplifies and facilitates its comparison with actively circulating strains and historical strains. The genotyping information provided by BioHansel can identify points of intervention to prevent the spread of pathogenic bacteria, screen for the presence of priority pathogens, and perform source attribution and risk assessment. Thus, BioHansel serves as a readily accessible and powerful WGS method, implementable on a laptop, for genotyping pathogens to detect, monitor, and control the emergence and spread of infectious disease through surveillance, screening, diagnostics, and outbreak investigation and response activities.

Recent CRISPR/Cas9 experiments have informed us on the exact areas of the wings in which WntA affects color pattern formation in both H. erato and H. melpomene, thus providing a unique comparative dataset to explore the functioning of a gene and its potential effect on phenotypic evolution. We therefore quantified wing color pattern differences in the mid-forewing region of 14 co-mimetic races of H. erato and H. melpomene and measured the extent to which mimicking races are not perfectly identical. While the relative size of the mid-forewing pattern is generally nearly identical, our results highlight the areas of the wing that prevent these species from achieving perfect mimicry and demonstrate that this mismatch can be largely explained by constraints imposed by divergence in the gene regulatory network that define wing color patterning. Divergence in the developmental architecture of a trait can thus constrain morphological evolution even between relatively closely related species.","NA"

The mini-chromosomes of these isolates turned out to be highly diverse with distinct sequence composition. They are enriched in repetitive elements and have lower gene density than core-chromosomes. We identified several virulence-related genes in the mini-chromosome of the rice isolate, including the polyketide synthase Ace1 and the effector gene AVR-Pik. Macrosynteny analyses around these loci revealed structural rearrangements, including inter-chromosomal translocations between core- and mini-chromosomes. Our findings provide evidence that mini-chromosomes independently emerge from structural rearrangements of core-chromosomes and might contribute to adaptive evolution of the blast fungus.

Author summaryThe genomes of plant pathogens often exhibit an architecture that facilitates high rates of dynamic rearrangements and genetic diversification in virulence associated regions. These regions, which tend to be gene sparse and repeat rich, are thought to serve as a cradle for adaptive evolution. Supernumerary chromosomes, i.e. chromosomes that are only present in some but not all individuals of a species, are a special type of structural variation that have been observed in plants, animals, and fungi. Here we identified and studied supernumerary mini-chromosomes in the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, a pathogen that causes some of the most destructive plant diseases. We found that rice, foxtail millet and goosegrass isolates of this pathogen contain mini-chromosomes with distinct sequence composition. All mini-chromosomes are rich in repetitive genetic elements and have lower gene densities than core-chromosomes. Further, we identified virulence-related genes on the mini-chromosome of the rice isolate. We observed large-scale genomic rearrangements around these loci, indicative of a role of mini-chromosomes in facilitating genome dynamics. Taken together, our results indicate that mini-chromosomes facilitate genome rearrangements and possibly adaptive evolution of the blast fungus.","NA"

B.","Ankur B Dalia","Indiana University","2020-01-11",1,"cc_no","new results","microbiology","Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) represent a major mechanism that bacteria use to sense and respond to their environment. Prototypical TCSs are composed of a membrane-embedded histidine kinase (HK), which senses an environmental stimulus and subsequently phosphorylates a cognate partner protein called a response regulator (RR) that regulates gene expression in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Vibrio cholerae uses the hybrid HK ChiS to activate the expression of the chitin utilization program, which is critical for the survival of this facultative pathogen in its aquatic reservoir. A cognate RR for ChiS has not been identified and the mechanism of ChiS-dependent signal transduction remains unclear. Here, we show that ChiS is a noncanonical membrane-embedded one-component system that can both sense chitin and directly regulate gene expression via a cryptic DNA binding domain. Unlike prototypical TCSs, we find that ChiS DNA binding is diminished, rather than stimulated, by phosphorylation. Finally, we provide evidence that ChiS likely activates gene expression by directly recruiting RNA polymerase. Together, this work addresses the mechanism of action for a major transcription factor in V. cholerae and highlights the versatility of signal transduction systems in bacterial species.

Significance StatementFrom bacteria to humans, the ability to properly respond to environmental cues is critical for survival. The cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae uses one protein, ChiS, to sense chitin in its environmental reservoir to regulate the expression of genes that are critical for the survival and evolution of this pathogen in this niche. Here, we study how the chitin sensor ChiS works, and discover that it regulates gene expression in an unexpected and unorthodox manner. Thus, this study uncovers how the major regulator ChiS works in this important human pathogen and highlights the versatile mechanisms that living systems use to respond to their environment.","NA"

However, the mechanism of how proteasome activity is maintained in cancer cells has remained unclear. The CNC family transcription factor NRF1 induces the expression of almost all proteasome-related genes under proteasome inhibition. NRF1 and its phylogenetically closest homolog NRF3 are both highly expressed in several types of cancers, such as colorectal cancer. Herein, we demonstrate that NRF1 and NRF3 complementarily maintain basal proteasome activity in cancer cells. A double knockdown of NRF1 and NRF3 impaired the basal proteasome activity in cancer cells and the cancer cell resistance to a proteasome inhibitor anticancer drug bortezomib by significantly reducing basal expression of seven proteasome-related genes, including PSMB3, PSMB7, PSMC2, PSMD3, PSMG2, PSMG3, and POMP. Interestingly, the molecular basis behind these cellular consequences was that NRF3 repressed NRF1 translation by the gene induction of translational regulator CPEB3, which binds to NRF1-3'UTR and decreases polysome formation on NRF1 mRNA. Consistent results were obtained from clinical analysis, wherein patients with cancer having higher CPEB3/NRF3-expressing tumors exhibit poor prognosis. These results provide the novel regulatory mechanism of basal proteasome activity in cancer cells through an NRF3-CPEB3-NRF1 translational repression axis.","NA"

While Aedes sp. of mosquito are the primary vector for ZIKV, sexual transmission of ZIKV is a significant route of infection. ZIKV has been documented in human, mouse and non-human primate (NHP) semen. It is critical to establish NHP models of vertical transfer of ZIKV that recapitulate human ZIKV pathogenesis. We hypothesized that vaginal deposition of ZIKV infected baboon semen would lead to maternal infection and vertical transfer in the olive baboon (Papio anubis). Timed pregnant baboons (n=6) were inoculated via vaginal deposition of baboon semen containing 106 ffu ZIKV (n=3, French Polynesian isolate:H/PF/2013, n=3 Puerto Rican isolate:PRVABC59) at mid-gestation (86-95 days gestation [dG]; term 183dG) on day (d) 0 (all dams), and then at 7 day intervals through three weeks. Maternal blood, saliva and cervico-vaginal washes were obtained at select days post-inoculation. Animals were euthanized at 28 days post initial inoculation (dpi; n=5) or 39 dpi (n=1) and maternal/fetal tissues collected. vRNA was quantified by qPCR. Viremia was achieved in 3/3 FP ZIKV infected dams and 2/3 PR ZIKV. ZIKV RNA was detected in cvw (5/6 dams;). ZIKV RNA was detected in lymph nodes, but not ovary, uterus, cervix or vagina in the FP ZIKV dams but was detected in uterus, vagina and lymph nodes. Placenta, amniotic fluid and all fetal tissues were ZIKV RNA negative in the FP infected dams whereas 2/3 PR infected dam placentas were ZIKV RNA positive. We conclude that ZIKV infected semen is a means of ZIKV transmission during pregnancy in primates. The PR isolate appeared more capable of wide spread dissemination to tissues, including placenta compared to the FP strain.

IMPORTANCEDue to its established link to pregnancy loss, microcephaly and other major congenital anomalies, Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a worldwide health threat. Although mosquitoes are the primary means of ZIVK transmission, sexual transmission in human populations is well documented and provides a means for widespread dissemination of the virus. Differences in viremia, tissue distribution, immune responses and pregnancy outcome from sexually transmitted ZIKV compared to the subcutaneous route of infection are needed to better clinically manage ZIKV in pregnancy. Through our previous work, we have developed the olive baboon as a non-human primate model of ZIKV infection that is permissible to ZIKV infection via the subcutaneous route of inoculation and transfer of ZIKV to the fetus in pregnancy. The current study evaluated the course of ZIKV infection after vaginal inoculation of ZIKV in pregnant baboons at mid-gestation using baboon semen as the carrier and comparing two isolates of ZIKV, the French Polynesian isolate first associated with microcephaly and the Puerto Rican isolate, associated with an increased risk of microcephaly observed in the Americas.","10.1128/JVI.00058-20"

The relative contribution to recognition memory are commonly distinguished in humans by analyzing receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curves; analogous methods are more complex and very rare in animals but fast familiarity and slow recollective-like processes (FF/SR) have been detected in non-human primates (NHPs) based on analyzing recognition error response time profiles. The relative utility of these methods to investigate familiarity and recollection/recollection-like processes across species is uncertain; indeed, even how comparable the FF/SR measures are across humans and NHPs remains unclear. Therefore in this study a broadly similar recognition memory task was exploited in both humans and NHPs to investigate the time course of the two recognition processes. We first show that the FF/SR dissociation exists in this task in human participants and then we demonstrate a similar profile in NHPs which suggests that FF/SR processes are comparable across species. We then verified, using ROC-derived indices for each time-bin in the FF/SR profile, that the ROC and FF/DR measures are related. Hence we argue that the FF/SR approach, procedurally easier in animals, can be used as a decent proxy to investigate these two recognition processes in future animal studies, important given that scant data exists as to the neural basis underlying recollection yet many of the most informative techniques primarily exist in animal models.","NA"

Here, we developed fast and cost-effective tests for the field detection of urease and CA activity using pH-sensitive strips inside microcentrifuge tubes that change color in response to the reaction products of urease (NH3) and CA (CO2). Samples from a saline lake, a series of calcareous fens, and ferrous springs were assayed in the field, finding relatively high urease activity in lake samples, whereas CA activity was only detected in a ferrous spring. Incubations of lake microbes with urea resulted in significantly higher CaCO3 precipitation compared to incubations with a urease inhibitor. Therefore, the rapid assay indicated an on-site active metabolism potentially mediating carbonate mineralization. Field urease and CA activity assays complement molecular approaches and facilitate the search for carbonate-precipitating microbes and their in situ activity, which could be applied toward agriculture, engineering and carbon sequestration technologies.","NA"

Alternatively, the neural code might be highly redundant, meaning that total information saturates. Here we investigated how information about the direction of a moving visual stimulus is distributed across hundreds of simultaneously recorded neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We found that information scales sublinearly, due to the presence of correlated noise in these populations. Using recent theoretical advances, we compartmentalized noise correlations into information-limiting and nonlimiting components, and then extrapolated to predict how information grows when neural populations are even larger. We predict that tens of thousands of neurons are required to encode 95% of the information about visual stimulus direction, a number much smaller than the number of neurons in V1. Overall, these findings suggest that the brain uses a widely distributed, but nonetheless redundant code that supports recovering most information from smaller subpopulations.","NA"

The prevalence of tropical theileriosis is high, buparvaquone resistance is widespread, and vaccine protection is poor in the field. Better understanding is, therefore, needed of the factors that influence the genetics of T. annulata populations both within its hosts and in its overall populations. Here we utilise a panel of six satellites and a mitochondrial cytochrome b marker to explore the multiplicity of T. annulata infection and patterns of emergence and spread of different parasite genotypes. Parasite materials were collected from infected animals in defined regions, where water buffalo and cattle are kept together. Our results show that T. annulata is genetically more diverse in cattle- than in water buffalo-derived populations (the mean numbers of unique satellite alleles were 13.3 and 1.8 and numbers of unique cytochrome b locus alleles were 65 and 27 in cattle- and water buffalo-derived populations, respectively). The data show a high level of genetic diversity among the individual host-derived populations (the overall heterozygosity (He) indices were 0.912 and 0.931 in cattle, and 0.874 and 0.861 in buffalo, based on satellite and cytochrome b loci, respectively). When considered in the context of high parasite transmission rates and frequent animal movements between different regions, the predominance of multiple T. annulata genotypes, with multiple introductions of infection in the hosts from which the parasite populations were derived, may have practical implications for the spread of parasite genetic adaptations; such as those conferring vaccine cross-protection against different strains affecting cattle and buffalo, or resistance to antiprotozoal drugs.","NA"

We argue that most scoring functions used for this task have been developed with insufficient thoughtfulness into the datasets on which they are trained and tested, leading to overly simplistic models and/or overtraining. These problems are compounded in the literature because none of the studies reporting new scoring methods have validated their model prospectively within the same study. Here, we report a new strategy for building a training dataset (D-COID) that aims to generate highly-compelling decoy complexes that are individually matched to available active complexes. Using this dataset, we train a general-purpose classifier for virtual screening (vScreenML) that is built on the XGBoost framework of gradient-boosted decision trees. In retrospective benchmarks, our new classifier shows outstanding performance relative to other scoring functions. We additionally evaluate the classifier in a prospective context, by screening for new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Remarkably, we find that nearly all compounds selected by vScreenML show detectable activity at 50 {micro}M, with 10 of 23 providing greater than 50% inhibition at this concentration.

Here, we focus on one such compartment, the ferrosome, which had been previously observed in the anaerobic bacterium Desulfovibrio magneticus6. We identify three ferrosome-associated (Fez) proteins, encoded by a putative operon, that are associated with and responsible for forming ferrosomes in D. magneticus. Fez proteins include FezB, a P1B-6-ATPase found in phylogenetically and metabolically diverse species of bacteria and archaea with anaerobic lifestyles.

The telomerase RNP core enzyme is composed of a dedicated RNA subunit and a reverse transcriptase (TERT). Although the majority of the 1157-nt Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase RNA, TLC1, is rapidly evolving, the central catalytic core is largely conserved, containing the template, template-boundary helix, pseudoknot, and core-enclosing helix (CEH). Here, we show that 4-base pairs of core-enclosing helix is required for telomerase to be active in vitro and to maintain yeast telomeres in vivo, whereas {Delta}CEH, 1-bp, and 2-bp alleles do not support telomerase function. Using the CRISPR/dCas9-based ""CARRY two-hybrid"" assay to assess binding of our CEH mutant RNAs to TERT, we find that the 4-bp CEH RNA binds to TERT, but the shorter-CEH constructs do not, consistent with the telomerase activity and in vivo complementation results. Thus, the CEH is essential in yeast telomerase RNA because it is needed to bind TERT to form the core RNP enzyme. Although the 8 nucleotides that form this 4-bp stem at the base of the CEH are nearly invariant among Saccharomyces species, our results with sequence-randomized and truncated-CEH helices strongly suggest that this binding interaction with TERT is dictated more by secondary than primary structure. In summary, we have mapped an essential binding site in telomerase RNA for TERT that is crucial to form the catalytic core of this biomedically important RNP enzyme.","NA"

This internal state is a product of cognitive factors, such as fatigue, motivation, and arousal, but it is unclear how these factors influence the neural processes that encode the sensory stimulus and form a decision. We discovered that, over the timescale of tens of minutes during a perceptual decision-making task, animals slowly shifted their likelihood of reporting stimulus changes. They did this unprompted by task conditions. We recorded neural population activity from visual area V4 as well as prefrontal cortex, and found that the activity of both areas slowly drifted together with the behavioral fluctuations. We reasoned that such slow fluctuations in behavior could either be due to slow changes in how the sensory stimulus is processed or due to a process that acts independently of sensory processing. By analyzing the recorded activity in conjunction with models of perceptual decision-making, we found evidence for the slow drift in neural activity acting as an impulsivity signal, overriding sensory evidence to dictate the final decision. Overall, this work uncovers an internal state embedded in the population activity across multiple brain areas, hidden from typical trial-averaged analyses and revealed only when considering the passage of time within each experimental session. Knowledge of this cognitive factor was critical in elucidating how sensory signals and the internal state together contribute to the decision-making process.","NA"

Using voxel decomposition (Norman-Haignere et al., 2015) to explain voxel responses across all 20 participants in terms of a small number of components, we replicated the existence of a music-selective response component similar in tuning and anatomical distribution to our earlier report. Critically, we also estimated components separately for musicians and non-musicians and found that a music-selective component was clearly present even in individuals with almost no musical training, which was very similar to the music component found in musicians. We also found that musical genres that were less familiar to our participants (e.g., Mongolian throat singing) produced strong responses within the music component, as did drum clips with rhythm but little melody. These data replicate the finding of music selectivity, broaden its scope to include unfamiliar musical genres and rhythms, and show that it is robustly present in people with almost no musical training. Our findings demonstrate that musical training is not necessary for music selectivity to emerge in non-primary auditory cortex, raising the possibility that music-selective brain responses could be a universal property of human auditory cortex.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRecent research has revealed populations of neurons in the human brain that respond more to music than to other sounds. How do these music-selective responses arise, and what range of music do they respond to? We scanned 10 expert musicians and 10 non-musicians with fMRI while they listened to a variety of music and other sounds. We found that neural populations specifically responsive to music exist to a similar degree in non-musicians and musicians alike. We further showed that these neural populations respond strongly to unfamiliar musical genres (e.g., Mongolian throat singing) and to drum clips with rhythm but little melody. These results show that neural populations selective for a wide variety of music can arise without explicit musical training.","NA"

Here, by evaluating various rationally designed models on their ability a) to make the lytic decision at MoI of 1 and the lysogeny decision at MoI of 2, b) to exhibit bistability at both MoIs, and c) to perform accurately in the presence of noise, it is demonstrated that lambdas lysis/lysogeny decision is based on three features, namely a) mutual repression, b) cooperative positive autoregulation of CI, and c) cooperative binding of the activator protein, not basal expression, triggering positive autoregulatory loop of CI. Cro and CI are sufficient to acquire the first two features. CII is required to acquire the third feature. The quasi-minimal two-protein model for the switch is justified by showing its qualitative equivalence, except for Cro repression of pRM, to the lambdas gene regulatory network responsible for the decision. A three-protein simplified version of the lambdas switch is shown to possess all the three design features. Bistability at MoI of 1 is responsible for lysogen stability, whereas bistability at MoI of 2 imparts stability to lytic development post-infection and especially during prophage induction.","NA"

T.","Ben Thomas Gleeson","Australian National University","2020-01-12",4,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","evolutionary biology","ObjectivesPre-historic decline in human craniofacial masculinity has been proposed as evidence of selection for elevated sociability and a process of  human self-domestication thought to have promoted complex capacities including language, culture, and cumulative technological development. This follows experimental observation of similar changes in non-human animals under selection for reduced aggression. Two distinct domestication hypotheses posit developmental explanations, involving hypoplasia of embryonic neural crest cells (NCCs), and declining androgen influence, respectively. Here, I assess the operation and potential interactions between these two mechanisms and consider their role in enhanced human adaptation to a cooperative sociocultural niche.

MethodsI provide a review and synthesis of related literature with a focus on physiological mechanisms effecting domesticated reductions in masculinity and sexual dimorphism. Further, I examine pre-historic modes of socio-sexual selection likely to drive human self-domestication via reduced aggression and masculinity.

ResultsI find pluripotent NCCs provide progenitors for a wide range of vertebrate masculine features, acting as regular targets for sexually driven evolutionary change; suggesting domesticated hypoplasia of NCC-derived tissues would be sufficient to explain declines in masculine traits and features. However, lineage specific androgen receptor variability likely moderates these NCC-based effects.

ConclusionsThese findings extend theorised mechanisms driving noted physiological, morphological, and behavioural changes thought to indicate enhanced sociability and human and self-domestication. Multiple current explanations for human sociability are consistent with physiological domestication under socio-sexual selection favouring dampened masculine physiology and behaviour as adaptations to an enhanced sociocultural niche. The analysis highlights multiple avenues for further investigation.","10.1007/s40750-019-00126-z"

The ASMR is characterized by a tingling sensation around the scalp and neck and often induces a feeling of relaxation and a reduction of a negative mood. However, it is still unknown what factors affect the ASMR. The present study focused on stimulus characteristics and individuals mood states and personality traits. Participants filled out self-reported questionnaires (the Profile of Mood States, Beck Depression Inventory, and Big Five Inventory) and reported ASMR estimates throughout a 17-min experiment while listening to binaural tapping and brushing sounds. Cross-correlation results showed that the ASMR estimates were strongly associated with the acoustic features of auditory stimuli, such as their amplitude, spectral centroid, and spectral bandwidth. This indicates that low-pitched sounds with dark timbre trigger the ASMR. The maximum ASMR was observed around 2 s after the acoustic features changed, suggesting that the sluggishness of multisensory integration may lead to the ASMR experience. In addition, individual differences in the ASMR experience were closely linked to participants mood states, such as anxiety, but not to their personality traits. Our results provide important clues to understand the mechanisms of auditory-somatosensory interactions.

Significant StatementsThe autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is characterized by a tingling, electrostatic-like sensation across the scalp and back of the neck. This phenomenon can be triggered by a variety of audiovisual stimuli, and many people seek out the ASMR via the internet to receive a feeling of relaxation and reduce a negative mood. We show that the ASMR is induced about 2 s after acoustic features, such as the amplitude, spectral centroid, and spectral bandwidth are changed. This suggests that low-pitched sounds with dark timbre lead to the ASMR experience. The stimulus-driven ASMR effect is found regardless of the personality traits or mood states of participants.

Changes in blood lipid levels were reported to be associated with depression and suicide, however study findings were mixed.

MethodsWe performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between blood lipids and depression phenotypes, based on large-scale GWAS summary statistics (N=188,577/480,359 for lipid/depression traits respectively). Five depression-related phenotypes were included, namely major depressive disorder (MDD; from PGC), depressive symptoms (DS; from SSGAC), longest duration and number of episodes of low mood, and history of deliberate self-harm (DSH)/suicide (from UK Biobank). MR was conducted with inverse-variance weighted (MR-IVW), Egger and Generalized Summary-data-based MR(GSMR) methods.

ResultsThere was consistent evidence that triglyceride (TG) is causally associated with DS (MR-IVW beta for one-SD increase in TG=0.0346, 95% CI=0.0114-0.0578), supported by MR-IVW and GSMR and multiple r2 clumping thresholds. We also observed relatively consistent associations of TG with DSH/suicide (MR-Egger OR= 2.514, CI: 1.579-4.003). There was moderate evidence for positive associations of TG with MDD and the number of episodes of low mood. For HDL-c, we observed moderate evidence for causal associations with DS and MDD. LDL-c and TC did not show robust causal relationships with depression phenotypes, except for weak evidence that LDL-c is inversely related to DSH/suicide. We did not detect significant associations when depression phenotypes were treated as exposures.

ConclusionsThis study provides evidence to a causal relationship between TG, and to a lesser extent, altered cholesterol levels with depression phenotypes. Further studies on its mechanistic basis and the effects of lipid-lowering therapies are warranted.","NA"

The underlying mechanism of SUDEP seems to be elusive to date. Although we had previously reported that seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) plays an important role in modulating the occurrence of SUDEP, especially for the epilepsy patients suffering from the ADHD and epilepsy, the exact mechanism of it to decode still needs to be explored. Given that our previous findings suggested that S-IRA evoked by acoustic stimulation or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) was markedly reduced by systemic administration of atomoxetine which commonly was used to treat ADHD, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), in DBA/1mice SUDEP model and norepinephrine -1 receptor (NE-1R) in brain acts as an important player in mediating the respiration function, we hypothesized that the suppressed effects of S-IRA by atomoxetine was via acting on NE-1R. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the suppressant incidence S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or PTZ by atomoxetine in DBA/1 mice SUDEP model. Our results suggest that the decreased incidence of S-IRA by atomoxetine was significantly reversed by intraperitoneal (IP) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injection of prazosin, a selective antagonist of NE-1R in our models. Furthermore, no obvious changes of electroencephalogram (EEG) data in cerebral cortex between the group with administration with atomoxetine and the group with administration of prazosin in PTZ injection SUDEP model to be observed. In addition, our data showed the repetitive acoustic stimulation or S-IRA didnt result in the reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)protein, a rate-limiting enzyme for synthesizing norepinephrine, in the brainstem of DBA/1 mice, suggesting that administration of atomoxetine reduced the incidence of S-IRA by enhancing the synaptic space concentration of norepinephrine via bypassing TH. Thus, our data suggest that deficiency of norepinephrine transmission contributed to seizure-induced respiratory arrest and NE-1R in the brain for children and adolescents epilepsy patients suffering from the co-morbidity of ADHD and epilepsy may be a potential and specific target to prevent SUDEP.","NA"

It far surpasses motifs of feedback inhibition, recurrent excitation, and divisive normalization invoked frequently in decision-making models. We demonstrate experimentally not only that this mechanism operates in the midbrain spatial selection network in barn owls, but also that it is required for categorical signaling by it. Indeed, the functional pattern of neural inhibition in the midbrain forms an exquisitely structured  multi-holed donut consistent with this networks combinatorial inhibitory function.

The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of AgNPs was 10 g/ml under dark conditions and 5 g/ml under light conditions. The combination of light and AgNPs led to 100% cell death after 60 minutes. Quantification of ROS via flow cytometry showed that LSPR stimulated AgNPs increased intracellular ROS concentration by 4.8-fold, suggesting that light-exposed AgNPs caused cell death via ROS production. Light exposition caused a small release of silver ions (0.4%) reaching a maximum after 6 hours. This indicates that silver ions play at most a secondary role in P. aeruginosa death. Overall, the results presented here show that LSPR generation from AgNPs by visible light enhances the antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles and can be an alternative for the treatment of topic infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as P. aeruginosa.","NA"

CV-B4 is able to infect human and murine thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and, in a murine TEC line, we have shown that the diabetogenic strain CV-B4 E2 decreases transcription of insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (Igf2), coding for the self-peptide of the insulin family. Here we show that in CV-B4 infection of mice alters Igf2 transcripts isoforms in TECs, followed by a decrease of pro-IGF2 precursor in the thymus. CV-B4 infection of a murine TEC line decreases Igf2 P3 promoter activity by targeting the region -68 to -22 upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) whereas Igf2 transcripts stability is not affected, pointing towards a regulation of Igf2 transcription. Our data also show that CV-B4 decreases IL-6/STAT3 signaling in vitro. This study provides new knowledge about the regulation of intrathymic Igf2 transcription by CV-B4 and reinforces the hypothesis that CV-B4 infection of the thymus could break central self-tolerance of the insulin family by decreasing Igf2 transcription and IGF2 presentation in thymus epithelium.

IMPORTANCECoxsackievirus B4 represents one of the most important environmental factors associated to type 1 diabetes, autoimmune disease for which no curative treatment exist. The diabetogenic strain Coxsackievirus B4 E2 was previously shown to decrease Igf2 expression, important player for central tolerance towards insulin, in a thymic epithelial cell line. The understanding of Igf2 regulation mechanisms during coxsackievirus B4 infection represents an interest for the understanding of central tolerance development but also for Igf2 transcriptional regulation itself, still poorly understood.

Here we demonstrate that, some transcripts isoforms of Igf2 are also decreased in thymic epithelial cells in vivo. Moreover, we show that this decrease is induced by an alteration of specific regions of Igf2 P3 promoter and may be linked by a decrease of STAT3 signaling. In fine we hope that this work could lead to future therapies leading to reprogramming central tolerance towards {beta} cells antigens via Igf2 expression.","NA"

After one year of bi-weekly transfer, communities retained hundreds of genera. To connect genes to function we used a simple experimental manipulation that involved periodic collection of selfish genetic elements (SGEs) from separate communities, followed by pooling and redistribution across communities. The treatment was predicted to promote amplification and dissemination of SGEs and thus horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Confirmation came from comparative metagenomics, which showed substantive movement of ecologically significant genes whose dynamic across space and time could be followed. Enrichment of genes implicated in nitrogen metabolism, and particularly ammonification, prompted biochemical assays that revealed a measurable impact on community function.

Here we calibrated conditions for performing SPT and live-SMLM of bioorthogonally labeled plasma membrane proteins in live mammalian cells. Using SPT, the diffusion of bioorthogonally labeled EGF receptor and the prototypical Shaker voltage-activated potassium channel (Kv) was measured and characterized. Applying live-SMLM to bioorthogonally labeled Shaker Kv channels enabled visualizing the plasma membrane distribution of the channel over time with ~30 nm accuracy. Finally, by competitive labeling with two Fl-dyes, SPT and live-SMLM were performed in a single cell and both the density and dynamics of the EGF receptor were measured at single molecule resolution in subregions of the cell.

We build a spatially explicit dynamical model that couples a multispecies community and its abiotic environment. We use numerical simulations and analytical techniques to determine the biotic and abiotic conditions under which ecotone emergence is expected to occur, and the role of biodiversity therein. We show that the diversity of ecosystem engineers can lead to indirect interactions through the modification of their shared environment. These interactions, which can be either competitive or mutualistic, can lead to the emergence of discrete communities in space, separated by sharp ecotones where a high species turnover is observed. Considering biodiversity is thus critical when studying the influence of species-environment interactions on the emergence of ecotones. This is especially true for the wide range of species that have small to moderate effects on their environment.

By employing IDEAS as our Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System, we identified and assigned epigenetic states simultaneously along chromosomes and across cell types, precisely and comprehensively. Combining nuclease accessibility and epigenetic states produced a set of over 200,000 candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) that efficiently capture enhancers and promoters. The transitions in epigenetic states of these cCREs across cell types provided insights into mechanisms of regulation, including decreases in numbers of active cCREs during differentiation of most lineages, transitions from poised to active or inactive states, and shifts in nuclease accessibility of CTCF-bound elements. Regression modeling of epigenetic states at cCREs and gene expression produced a versatile resource to improve selection of cCREs potentially regulating target genes.

Recent experiments suggest that size control of many intracellular assemblies is achieved through the depletion of a limiting subunit pool in the cytoplasm. While the limiting pool model ensures organelle size scaling with cell size, it does not provide a mechanism for robust size control of multiple co-existing structures. Here we propose a kinetic theory for size regulation of multiple structures that are assembled from a shared pool of subunits. We demonstrate that a negative feedback between the growth rate and the size of individual structures underlies size regulation of a wide variety of intracellular assemblies, from cytoskeletal filaments to three-dimensional organelles such as centrosomes and the nucleus. We identify the feedback motifs for size control in these structures, based on known molecular interactions, and quantitatively compare our theory with available experimental data. Furthermore, we show that a positive feedback between structure size and growth rate can lead to bistable size distributions arising from autocatalytic growth. In the limit of high subunit concentration, autocatalytic growth of multiple structures leads to stochastic selection of a single structure, elucidating a mechanism for polarity establishment.","NA"

Similar to membranes composed of amphiphilic lipids, these nucleoprotein-RNA vesicular membranes exhibit local ordering, size-dependent permeability, and selective encapsulation capacity without sacrificing their dynamic formation and dissolution in response to physicochemical stimuli. Our findings suggest that protein-RNA complexes can robustly create lipid-free vesicle-like enclosures by phase separation.

Significance statementVesicular assemblies play crucial roles in subcellular organization as well as in biotechnological applications. Classically, the ability to form such assemblies were primarily assigned to lipids and lipid-like amphiphilic molecules. Here, we show that disordered RNA-protein complexes can form vesicle-like ordered assemblies at disproportionate mixture compositions. We also show that the ability to form vesicular assemblies is generic to multi-component systems where phase separation is driven by heterotypic interactions. We speculate that such vesicular assemblies play crucial roles in the formation of dynamic multi-layered subcellular membrane-less organelles and can be utilized to fabricate novel stimuli-responsive microscale systems.","NA"

Here, we approach this question by testing whether increasing monetary incentives results in better overall VWM performance. In two experiments, subjects performed a delayed-estimation task on the Amazon Turk platform. In both experiments, four groups of subjects received a bonus payment based on their performance, with the maximum bonus ranging from $0 to $10 between groups.

Subsequently, an important question is how to efficiently represent, compress, and transmit de Bruijn graphs of most common types of genomic data sets, such as sequencing reads, genomes, and pan-genomes.

ResultsWe introduce simplitigs, an efficient representation of de Bruijn graphs for alignment-free applications. Simplitigs are a generalization of unitigs and correspond to spellings of vertex-disjoint paths in a de Bruijn graph. We present an easy-to-plug-in greedy heuristic for their computation and implement it in a program called ProphAsm. We use ProphAsm to compare the scaling of simplitigs and unitigs on a range of genomic datasets. We demonstrate that simplitigs are superior to unitigs in terms of the cumulative sequence length as well as of the number of sequences, and that are sufficiently close to theoretical bounds for practical applications. Finally, we demonstrate that, when combined with standard full-text indexes, simplitigs provide a scalable solution for k-mer search.

The nuclear genomes resulting from allopolyploidization contain homologous gene copies from different evolutionary origins called homoeologs, whose orthologs must be sorted out in order to reconstruct the evolutionary history of polyploid clades. In this study, we propose a methodological approach to resolve the phylogeny of allopolyploid clades focusing on mesopolyploid genomes, which experienced some level of genome reshuffling and gene fractionation across their subgenomes. To illustrate our methodological framework we applied it to a clade belonging to the model Brassicaceae plant family, the Brassiceae tribe, that experienced a mesohexaploidy event. The dataset analysed consists of both publically available genomic sequences and new transcriptomic data according to taxa. The present methodology requires a well-annotated reference genome, for which the identification of the parental subgenome fragments has been performed (e.g. Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea). Focusing on fully retained genes (i.e. genes for which all homoeologous gene copies inherited from the parental lineages are still present in the reference genome), the method constructs multi-labelled gene trees that allow subsequent assignment of each gene copy to its diploid parental lineage. Once the orthologous copies are identified, genes from the same parental origin are concatenated and tree-building methods are used to reconstruct the species tree. This method allows resolving the phylogenetic relationships (i) among extant species within a mesopolyploid clade, (ii) among the parental lineages of a mesopolyploid lineage, and (iii) between the parental lineages and closely related extant species. We report here the first well-resolved nuclear-based phylogeny of the Brassiceae tribe.","NA"

Recently, accumulated evidence showed that R-loops widely present in various organisms genomes and are involved in many physiological processes, including DNA replication, RNA transcription, and DNA repair. RNase H-like superfamily (RNHLS) domain-containing proteins, such as RNase H enzymes, are essential in restricting R-loop levels. However, little is known about the function and relationship of other RNHLS proteins on R-loop regulation, especially in plants.

ResultsIn this study, we characterized 6193 RNHLS proteins from 13 representative plant species and clustered these proteins into 27 clusters, among which reverse transcriptases and exonucleases are the two largest groups. Moreover, we found 691 RNHLS proteins in Arabidopsis with a conserved catalytic alpha-helix and beta-sheet motif. Interestingly, each of the Arabidopsis RNHLS proteins is composed of not only an RNHLS domain but also another different protein domain. Additionally, the RNHLS genes are highly expressed in different meristems and metabolic tissues, which indicate that the RNHLS proteins might play important roles in the development and maintenance of these tissues.

ConclusionsIn summary, we systematically analyzed RNHL proteins in plants and found that there are mainly 27 subclusters of them. Most of these proteins might be implicated in DNA replication, RNA transcription, and nucleic acid degradation. We classified and characterized the RNHLS proteins in plants, which may afford new insights into the investigation of novel regulatory mechanisms and functions of R-loops.","NA"

Computational models that estimate the interaction strength of new drug-target pairs have the potential to expedite drug repurposing. Several models have been proposed for this task. However, these models represent the drugs as strings, which is not a natural way to represent molecules.

The learning of implied order differs from learning of explicit visual or motor sequences. We recorded the activity of parietal neurons in rhesus macaques while they learned 7-item TI lists when only 2 items were presented on each trial. Behavior and ensemble neuronal activity were significantly influenced by the ordinal relationship of the stimulus pairs, specifically symbolic distance (the difference in rank) and joint ranks (the sum of the ranks). Symbolic distance strongly predicted decision accuracy, and learning was consistently faster as symbolic distance increased. An effect of joint rank on performance was also found nested within the symbolic distance effect. Across the population of neurons, there was significant modulation of firing correlated with the relative ranks of the two stimuli presented on each trial. Neurons exhibited selectivity for stimulus rank during learning, but not before or after. The observed behavior during learning is best explained by a virtual workspace model, not by associative or reward mechanisms. The neural data support a role for posterior parietal cortex in representing several variables that contribute to serial learning, particularly information about the ordinal ranks of the stimuli presented during a given trial. Thus, parietal cortex appears to belong to a neural substrate for learning and representing abstract relationships in a virtual workspace.","NA"

To monitor the temporal dynamics of processing, we recorded multiple-unit firings of CA1 neurons in male rats experiencing one of four episodes for 10 min: restraint stress, social interaction with a female or male, or observation of a novel object. Before an experience, the neurons mostly exhibited sporadic firings with some synchronized ({approx} 50 ms) ripple-like firing events in habituated home cage. After experience onset, restraint or social interaction with other rats induced spontaneous high-frequency firings (super bursts) intermittently, while object observation induced the events inconsistently. Minutes after experience initiation, CA1 neurons frequently exhibited ripple-like firings with less-firing silent periods. The number of ripple-like events depended on the episode experienced and correlated with the total duration of super bursts. Experience clearly diversified multiple features of individual ripple-like events in an episode-specific manner, sustained for more than 30 min in the home cage.

Ex vivo patch clamp analysis further revealed experience-promoted synaptic plasticity. Compared with unexposed controls, animals experiencing the female, male, or restraint episodes showed cell-dependently increased AMPA- or GABAA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents, whereas contact with a novel object increased only GABAergic currents. Multivariate ANOVA in multi-dimensional virtual space revealed experience-specific super bursts with subsequent ripple-like events and synaptic plasticity, leading us to hypothesize that these factors are responsible for creating experience-specific memory. It is possible to decipher encrypted experience through the deep learning of the orchestrated ripple-like firings and synaptic plasticity in multiple CA1 neurons.","NA"

In a full-factorial greenhouse experiment we analysed the effect of soil burial depth and litter cover on the germination of invasive plants. We hypothesised that (i) burial depth and litter cover affect the germination of the studied species, (ii) the effects of burial and litter cover interact with each other, and (iii) the effects are species-specific, but dependent on seed size.

MethodsWe tested the germination and seedling growth of 11 herbaceous invasive species in a full-factorial experiment using four levels of seed burial depths and litter cover. We analysed the effect of burial, litter cover, and their interactions on germination, seedling length and biomass across species and at the species level.

ResultsSoil burial depth and litter cover had a significant effect on the germination of the studied species, but there were considerable differences between species. We observed a general trend of species with bigger seeds being not or less seriously affected by soil burial and litter cover than smaller-seeded species. Correlations between seed weight and effect sizes mostly confirmed this general trend, but not in the case of soil burial.

ConclusionsOur findings confirmed that seed size is a major driver of species response to litter cover and to the combined effects of litter cover and soil burial, but there is no general trend regarding the response to soil burial depth. Despite its very small seeds the germination of Cynodon dactylon was not affected by soil burial. The germination of Ambrosia artemisiifolia was hampered by both soil burial and litter cover despite its relatively large seeds. Thus, specific information on species response to burial depth and litter accumulation is crucial when planning management or restoration in areas threatened by plant invasions.","10.1111/jvs.12891"

We used near-isogenic lines to obtain healthy and infected host plants. The microbiome associated with the two types of plant residues was characterised by metabarcoding. A combination of linear discriminant analysis and ecological network analysis was used to compare the microbial communities and to identify micro-organisms interacting with L. maculans. Fungal community structure differed between the two lines at harvest, but not subsequently, suggesting that the presence/absence of the resistance gene influences the microbiome at the base of the stem whilst the plant is alive, but that this does not necessarily lead to differential colonisation of the residues by fungi. Direct interactions with other members of the community involved many fungal and bacterial ASVs (amplicon sequence variants). L. maculans appeared to play a minor role in networks, whereas one ASV affiliated to Plenodomus biglobosus (synonym Leptosphaeria biglobosa) from the Leptosphaeria species complex may be considered a keystone taxon in the networks at harvest.

In this study, our aim was to find out if the main habitat types can be grouped into two distinct habitat categories (which would support the dichotomic description), or a different paradigm better fits this complex ecosystem. We selected six main habitats of sandy forest-steppes, and, using 176 releves, we compared their vegetation based on species composition (NMDS ordination, number of common species of the studied habitats), relative ecological indicator values (mean indicators for temperature, soil moisture, and light availability), and functional species groups (life-form categories, geoelement types, and phytosociological preference groups). According to the species composition, we found a well-defined gradient, with the following habitat order: large forest patches - medium forest patches - small forest patches - north-facing edges - south-facing edges - grasslands. A considerable number of species were shared among all habitats, while the number of species restricted to certain habitat types was also numerous, especially for north-facing edges. The total (i.e., pooled) number of species peaked near the middle of the gradient, in north-facing edges. The relative ecological indicator values and functional species groups showed mostly gradual changes from the large forest patches to the grasslands. Our results indicate that the widely used dichotomic categorization of forest-steppe habitats into forest and grassland patches is too simplistic, potentially resulting in a considerable loss of information.

We have previously shown that replacing seven amino acids at the cleavage site of PBS1 with a motif cleaved by the NIa protease of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) enables RPS5 activation upon TuMV infection. However, this engineered resistance conferred a trailing necrosis phenotype indicative of a cell death response too slow to contain the virus. We theorized this could result from a positional mismatch within the cell between PBS1TuMV, RPS5 and the NIa protease. To test this, we re-localized PBS1TuMV and RPS5 to cellular sites of NIa accumulation. These experiments revealed that relocation of RPS5 away from the plasma membrane compromised RPS5-dependent cell death in N. benthamiana, even though PBS1 was efficiently cleaved. As an alternative approach, we tested whether overexpression of plasma membrane-localized PBS1TuMV would enhance RPS5 activation by TuMV. Significantly, over-expressing the PBS1TuMV decoy protein conferred complete resistance to TuMV when delivered by either Agrobacterium or by aphid transmission, showing that RPS5-mediated defense responses are effective against bacterial and viral pathogens. Lastly, we have now extended this PBS1 decoy approach to soybean by modifying a soybean PBS1 ortholog to be cleaved by the NIa protease of soybean mosaic virus (SMV). Transgenic overexpression of this soybean PBS1 decoy conferred immunity to SMV, demonstrating that we can use endogenous PBS1 proteins in crop plants to engineer economically relevant disease resistant traits.","10.1094/MPMI-07-19-0190-R"

Fluorescent probes are indispensable tools for monitoring intracellular sodium levels in single living cells in heterogeneous cell populations and tissues. Since the fluorescence of sodium-sensitive dyes in cells is significantly different from that in an aqueous solution, the fluorescence signal is calibrated in situ by changing the concentration of extracellular sodium in the presence of ionophores, making the membrane permeable to sodium and equilibrating its intra- and extracellular concentrations. The reliability of this calibration method has not been well studied. Here, we compare the determinations of the intracellular sodium concentration by flame emission photometry and flow cytometry using the Na+-sensitive probe Asante Natrium Green-2 (ANG). The intracellular Na+ concentration was altered using known ionophores or, alternatively, by blocking the sodium pump with ouabain or by causing cell apoptosis with staurosporine. The use of U937 cells cultured in suspension allowed the fluorometry of single cells by flow cytometry and flame emission analysis of samples checked for uniform cell populations. It is revealed that the ANG fluorescence of cells treated with ionophores is approximately two times lower than that in cells with the same Na+ concentration but not treated with ionophores. Although the mechanism is still unknown, this effect should be taken into account when a quantitative assessment of the concentration of intracellular sodium is required.

Traditionally, studies have tended to consider YAP and TAZ as functionally redundant transcriptional cofactors, with similar biological impact. However, there is growing evidence that each of them also possesses distinct attributes. Here, we sought to systematically characterize the division of labor between YAP and TAZ in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common histological subtype of lung cancer. Employing representative NSCLC cell lines, as well as patient-derived data, we show that the two paralogs orchestrate non-overlapping transcription programs in this cancer type: whereas YAP preferentially regulates gene sets associated with cell division and cell cycle progression, TAZ preferentially regulates genes associated with extracellular matrix organization. Concordantly, depletion of YAP, but not TAZ, leads to growth arrest, while YAP overexpression promotes cell proliferation. Likewise, depletion of TAZ, but not YAP, compromises cell migration, whereas TAZ overexpression enhances migration. Importantly, the differential effects of YAP vs TAZ on key cellular processes are also associated with differential response to anti-cancer therapies. Uncovering the different activities and downstream effects of YAP and TAZ may thus facilitate better stratification of lung cancer patients for anti-cancer therapies.","NA"

MYH9 was significantly reduced by ITE treatment in human glioma cells.

It is one of the most intelligent and well-studied invertebrates, possessing both long- and short-term memory and the striking ability to perform complex cognitive tasks. Nevertheless, how the common octopus developed these uncommon features remains enigmatic. O. vulgaris females spawn thousands of small eggs and remain with their clutch during their entire development, cleaning, venting and protecting the eggs. In fact, eggs incubated without females usually do not develop normally, mainly due to biological contamination (fungi, bacteria, etc.). This high level of parental care might have hampered laboratory research on the embryonic development of this intriguing cephalopod.

ResultsHere, we present a completely parameter-controlled artificial seawater standalone egg incubation system that replaces maternal care and allows successful embryonic development of a small-egged octopus species until hatching in a laboratory environment. We also provide a practical and detailed 1 staging atlas based on bright-field and light sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging for precise monitoring of embryonic development. The atlas has a comparative section to benchmark stages to the different scales published by Naef (1928), Arnold (1965) and Boletzky (2016). Finally, we provide methods to monitor health and wellbeing of embryos during organogenesis.

ConclusionBesides introducing the study of O. vulgaris embryonic development to a wider community, this work can be a high-quality reference for comparative evolutionary developmental biology.","NA"

They promote key allosteric transitions that stabilize Hsp70 interaction with substrate polypeptides upon hydrolysis of its bound ATP. Although a recent crystal structure revealed the physical mode of interaction between a J-domain and an Hsp70, the structural and dynamic consequences of J-domain action once bound and how Hsp70s discriminate among its multiple JDP partners remain enigmatic. We combined free energy simulations, biochemical assays and evolutionary analyses to address these issues. Our results indicate that the invariant aspartate of the J-domain perturbs a conserved intramolecular Hsp70 network of contacts that crosses domains. This perturbation leads to destabilization of the domain-domain interface - thereby promoting the allosteric transition that triggers ATP hydrolysis. While this mechanistic step is driven by conserved residues, evolutionarily variable residues are key to initial JDP/Hsp70 recognition - via electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged surfaces. We speculate that these variable residues allow an Hsp70 to discriminate amongst JDP partners, as many of them have coevolved. Together, our data points to a two-step mode of J-domain action, a recognition stage followed by a mechanistic stage.

Simulated cortical theta oscillators flexibly phase-locked to slow inputs when these inputs caused both (i) spiking and (ii) the subsequent buildup of outward current sufficient to delay further spiking until the next input.

The first two alter the action potential waveform, whereas the third increases the ""noise""; all three factors confound attempts to detect and classify single neurons (units). To address these analytical difficulties, we developed a novel template-matching based spike sorting method, which enabled identification of 1,239 single units in 27 patients with intractable focal epilepsy, that were tracked throughout multiple seizures. These new analyses showed continued neuronal firing through the ictal transition, which was defined as a transient period of intense tonic firing consistent with previous descriptions of the ictal wavefront. After the ictal transition, neurons displayed increased spike duration (p < 0.001) and reduced spike amplitude (p < 0.001), in keeping with prior animal studies; units in non-recruited territories, by contrast, showed more stable waveforms. All units returned to their pre-ictal waveforms after seizure termination. Waveshape changes were stereotyped across seizures within patients. Our analyses of single neuron firing patterns, at the ictal wavefront, showed widespread intense activation, and commonly involving marked waveshape alteration. We conclude that the distinction between tissue that has been recruited to the seizure versus non-recruited territories is evident at the level of single neurons, and that increased waveform duration and decreased waveform amplitude are hallmarks of seizure invasion that could be used as defining characteristics of local recruitment.

Eye blink EMG has a bell-shaped potential when startle probes are elicited, that strongly corresponds to amygdala activity. Considering how amygdala activity fluctuates over time in response to emotional and self-threatening stimuli, observing startle eyeblink size fluctuation over time could provide a cost-effective, convenient, and less resource intensive means for examining amygdala activity over time. Yet based on current standards in the literature, often startle evoked eye blink EMG values do not exhibit activity 3SDs from the mean eyeblink response, thus these trials are typically excluded from startle analyses. It stands to reason, however, that these trials may still index amygdala activity in a meaningful way. Through investigating the association between startle eyeblink amplitude, corresponding ERP amplitude, and underlying neural activity, the current study provides evidence that startle amplitudes exhibit a linear relationship with proxies for amygdala activity, e.g., N100 amplitudes and regions heavily interconnected with the amygdala. Specifically, the startle reflex correlates to large amount of brain regions in N100 time window in addition to the N100 amplitude.

Altogether, delineating the requirements and properties of polar trophoblasts and blastocyst axis formation in vitro provides a foundation for the precise description and dissection of early development.","NA"

We have analyzed here the variation of two families of regulatory small nucleolar RNAs (SNORD115 and SNORD116) that are coded within the PWS and are expressed from the paternal chromosome. They are organized in two tandemly repeated clusters which are naturally copy number variable between individuals. We find that the copy numbers at these loci correlate with repeatable individual test scores for anxiety that are considered to constitute a component of the ""personality"" of individuals. We show this for different populations and species of mice, cavies and for the anxiety component of personality tests in humans. This is also the case for an inbred mouse strain (C57Bl6) implying that copy number variation creates phenotypic variability even in an isogenic background. In transcriptome data from brain samples of this strain we find SNORD copy-number correlated regulation of target genes that are known to be involved in influencing behavior. SNORD115 has previously been suggested to regulate splicing of the serotonin receptor Htr2c and we confirm this in our data. For SNORD116 we provide evidence that it regulates the expression level of the chromatin regulator Ankrd11, which itself regulates GABA receptors, metabolic pathways, cell differentiation and osteogenesis. Intriguingly, we find that craniofacial shapes in mice correlate also with SNORD116 copy numbers. New copy number variants are generated at very high rates in mice, possibly at every generation, explaining why conventional genetic mapping could not detect this association. Our results suggest that the variable dosage of two regulatory RNAs are major determinants of individual behavioral differences and correlated traits in mammals.","NA"

Currently, there is an urgent need to elucidate the genetic mechanism of LA at canopy-wide levels for optimizing dense-planting canopy architecture. In present study, one RIL population derived from two parent lines which show distinct plant architecture was used to perform QTL mapping for LA at eight leaves below the tassel under three environments. Dozens of QTL for LA at eight leaves were identified, which were mapped on all maize chromosomes except for the tenth chromosome. Among them, there were nine common QTL as they were identified for LA more than 1 leaves or in two or three environments. And individual QTL could explain 1.29% - 20.14% of the phenotypic variation and affect LA of 1-8 leaves, including qLA5.1 affected LA of all eight leaves, qLA3.1 affected LA of the upper leaves (1stLA to 4thLA), and qLA9.1 could affect LA of the lower leaves (5thLA to 8thLA). Furthermore, the results indicated that the genetic architecture of LA at eight leaves was different. Specifically, 8thLA was mainly affected by major and minor QTL; 1stLA, 4thLA and 5thLA were affected by epistatic interactions beside major and minor QTL; while the other four LAs were simultaneously affected by major QTL, minor QTL, epistatic interactions and environments. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of genetic basis of LA at canopy-wide levels, which will be beneficial to design ideal plant architecture under dense planting in maize.

We purified SMALPs by affinity chromatography and quantitatively analyzed the lipids by mass spectrometry and their role in transporter function. We found that phospholipid and sterol concentrations are similar for MCC and MCP, but sphingolipids are enriched in MCP. Ergosterol is depleted from the periprotein lipidome, whereas phosphatidylserine is enriched relative to the bulk of the plasma membrane. Phosphatidylserine, non-bilayer lipids and ergosterol are essential for activity of Lyp1; the transporter also requires a balance of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids.

It increases the hit rate by incorporating receptor flexibility into molecular docking as demonstrated on important drug targets including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Adenosine A1 receptor (A1AR) is a key GPCR that has been targeted for treating cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injuries, neuropathic pain and renal diseases. Development of allosteric modulators, compounds binding to distinct and less conserved GPCR target sites compared with agonists and antagonists, has attracted increasing interest for designing selective drugs of the A1AR. Despite significant advances, more effective approaches are needed to discover potent and selective allosteric modulators of the A1AR.

MethodsEnsemble docking that integrates Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamic (GaMD) simulations and molecular docking using Autodock has been implemented for retrospective docking of known positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) in the A1AR.

ResultsEnsemble docking outperforms docking of the receptor cryo-EM structure. The calculated docking enrichment factors (EFs) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) are significantly increased.

ConclusionsReceptor ensembles generated from GaMD simulations are able to increase the success rate of discovering PAMs of A1AR. It is important to account for receptor flexibility through GaMD simulations and flexible docking.

Astrocyte-specific conditional deletion of Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) suppressed perivascular mitochondrial clustering and disrupted mitochondria-ER contact sites.

In many clinically relevant applications, constitutively active CRISPR-Cas9 is delivered into human cells without a temporal control system. Excessive and prolonged expression CRISPR-Cas9 can lead to elevated off-target cleavage. The need for modulating CRISPR-Cas9 activity over the dimensions of time and dose has created the demand of developing CRISPR-Cas off-switches. Protein and small molecule-based CRISPR-Cas inhibitors have been reported in previous studies.

ResultsWe report the discovery of Cas9-inhibiting peptides from inoviridae bacteriophages. These peptides, derived from the periplasmic domain of phage major coat protein G8P (G8PPD), can inhibit the in vitro activity of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) proteins in an allosteric manner. Importantly, the inhibitory activity of G8PPD on SpCas9 is dependent on the order of guide RNA addition. Ectopic expression of full-length G8P (G8PFL) or G8PPD in human cells can inactivate the genome-editing activity of SpCas9 with minimum alterations of the mutation patterns. Furthermore, unlike the anti-CRISPR protein AcrII4A that completely abolishes the cellular activity of CRISPR-Cas9, G8P co-transfection can reduce the off-target activity of co-transfected SpCas9 while retaining its on-target activity.

ConclusionG8Ps discovered in the current study represent the first anti-CRISPR peptides that can allosterically inactivate CRISPR-Cas9. This finding may provide insights into developing next-generation CRISPR-Cas inhibitors for precision genome engineering.","10.1186/s13059-020-01956-x"

Traditional data-driven methods based on Wiener-Granger causality quantify information transferred between neuronal signals, but do not reveal whether transmission of information refers to one specific feature of external stimuli or another. Here, we developed a new measure called Feature-specific Information Transfer (FIT), that quantifies the amount of information transferred between neuronal signals about specific stimulus features. The FIT quantifies the feature-related information carried by a receiver that was previously carried by a sender, but that was never carried by the receiver earlier. We tested the FIT on simulated data in various scenarios. We found that, unlike previous measures, FIT successfully disambiguated genuine feature-specific communication from non-feature specific communication, from external confounding inputs and synergistic interactions. Moreover, the FIT had enhanced temporal sensitivity that facilitates the estimation of the directionality of transfer and the communication delay between neuronal signals. We validated the FITs ability to track feature-specific information flow using neurophysiological data. In human electroencephalographic data acquired during a face detection task, the FIT demonstrated that information about the eye in face pictures flowed from the hemisphere contralateral to the eye to the ipsilateral one. In multi-unit activity recorded from thalamic nuclei and primary sensory cortices of rats during multimodal stimulation, FIT, unlike Wiener-Granger methods, credibly detected both the direction of information flow and the sensory features about which information was transmitted. In human cortical high-gamma activity recorded with magnetoencephalography during visuomotor mapping, FIT showed that visuomotor-related information flowed from superior parietal to premotor areas. Our work suggests that the FIT measure has the potential to uncover previously hidden feature-specific information transfer in neuronal recordings and to provide a better understanding of brain communication.

Author summaryThe emergence of coherent percepts and behavior relies on the processing and flow of information about sensory features, such as the color or shape of an object, across different areas of the brain. To understand how computations within the brain lead to the emergence of these functions, we need to map the flow of information about each specific feature. Traditional methods, such as those based on Wiener-Granger causality, quantify whether information is transmitted from one brain area to another, but do not reveal if the information being transmitted is about a certain feature or another feature. Here, we develop a new mathematical technique for the analysis of brain activity recordings, called Feature-specific Information Transfer (FIT), that can reveal not only if any information is being transmitted across areas, but whether or not such transmitted information is about a certain sensory feature. We validate the method with both simulated and real neuronal data, showing its power in detecting the presence of feature-specific information transmission, as well as the timing and directionality of this transfer. This work provides a tool of high potential significance to map sensory information processing in the brain.","NA"

Pairing sound with whisker stimulation modulates tactile responses in both S1 and S2, with the most prominent modulation being robust inhibition in S2. The degree of inhibition depends on tactile stimulation frequency, with lower frequency responses the most severely attenuated. Alongside these neurons, we identify sound-selective neurons in S2 whose responses are inhibited by high tactile frequencies. These results are consistent with a hypothesized local mutually-inhibitory S2 circuit that spectrally selects tactile versus auditory inputs.

As a result, and thanks to third generation sequencing technologies, the number of discovered SVs is increasing, especially in the human genome. At the same time, for several applications such as clinical diagnoses, it is important to genotype newly sequenced individuals on well defined and characterized SVs. Whereas several SV genotypers have been developed for short read data, there is a lack of such dedicated tool to assess whether known SVs are present or not in a new long read sequenced sample, such as the one produced by Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

ResultsWe present a novel method to genotype known SVs from long read sequencing data. The method is based on the generation of a set of reference sequences that represent the two alleles of each structural variant. Long reads are aligned to these reference sequences. Alignments are then analyzed and filtered out to keep only informative ones, to quantify and estimate the presence of each SV allele and the allele frequencies. We provide an implementation of the method, SVJedi, to genotype insertions and deletions with long reads. The tool has been applied to both simulated and real human datasets and achieves high genotyping accuracy. We also demonstrate that SV genotyping is considerably improved with SVJedi compared to other approaches, namely SV discovery and short read SV genotyping approaches.

Motors are adapted to their function, in part, by tuning the thermodynamics and kinetics of steps in this cycle. However, it remains unclear how sequence encodes these differences, since biochemically distinct motors often have nearly indistinguishable crystal structures. We hypothesized that sequences produce distinct biochemical phenotypes by modulating the relative probabilities of an ensemble of conformations primed for different functional roles. To test this hypothesis, we modeled the distribution of conformations for twelve myosin motor domains by building Markov state models (MSMs) from an unprecedented two milliseconds of all-atom, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations. Comparing motors reveals shifts in the balance between nucleotide-favorable and nucleotide-unfavorable P-loop conformations that predict experimentally-measured duty ratios and ADP release rates better than sequence or individual structures. This result demonstrates the power of an ensemble perspective for interrogating sequence-function relationships.

We report the first vertebrate mutant U8 animal model for interrogating LCC-associated pathology. Mutant U8 zebrafish exhibit defective central nervous system development and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis, with tp53 activation which monitors ribosome biogenesis. Importantly, LCC patient fibroblasts demonstrate rRNA processing defects. Human precursor-U8 (pre-U8) containing a 3 extension rescued mutant U8 zebrafish, indicating conserved biological function. Analysis of LCC-associated U8 alleles in zebrafish revealed that one null and one hypomorphic, but still functional, allele combine to cause LCC. Mutations involving any one of seven nucleotides within the human pre-U8 3 extension, or 5 region of U8, alter processing of pre-U8, and identify a novel base-pairing interaction between the 5 end and 3 extension of human pre-U8. Variants in these seven nucleotides, one of which is present on a single allele in almost all patients, act as hypomorphic mutations. Given that biallelic null U8 alleles are likely incompatible with human development, identification of hypomorphic mutations mediating viable embryogenesis furthers understanding of LCC molecular pathology and cerebral vascular homeostasis.","NA"

In an era of escalating human populations and climate change, it is vital to understand the infection mechanism of Pst in order to develop better strategies to combat wheat yellow disease. This study focuses on the identification of small secreted proteins (SSPs) and candidate-secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) that are used by the pathogen to support infection and control disease development. We generated de novo assembled transcriptomes of Pst collected from wheat fields in central Anatolia. We inoculated both susceptible and resistant seedlings with Pst and analyzed haustoria formation. At 10 days post-inoculation (dpi), we analyzed the transcriptomes and identified 10,550 Differentially Expressed Unigenes (DEGs), of which 6,220 were Pst-related. Among those Pst-related genes, 230 were predicted as PstSSPs. In silico characterization was performed using an approach combining the transcriptomic data and data mining results to provide a reliable list to narrow down the ever-expanding repertoire of predicted effectorome. The comprehensive analysis detected 14 Differentially Expressed Small-Secreted Proteins (DESSPs) that overlapped with the genes in available literature data to serve as the best CSEPs for experimental validation. One of the CSEPs was cloned and studied to test the reliability of the presented data. Biological assays show that the randomly selected CSEP, Unigene17495 (PSTG_10917), localizes in the chloroplast and is able to suppress cell death induced by INF1 in a Nicotiana benthamiana heterologous expression system.","NA"

H.","Alice B Popejoy","Stanford University","2020-01-13",1,"cc_by_nc","new results","evolutionary biology","An open question in comparative evolutionary genomics is whether or not certain loci are the primary drivers of divergence between taxonomic lineages or species groups. Alternatively, genetic drivers of species divergence may be evenly distributed across the genome. The increasing availability of genome sequences from diverse taxa has enabled the development of novel methods to address this question. Genomes of many highly diverged species may now be compared in order to tease apart genetic differences that drive adaptive or functional divergence, and genetic differences that are observed by chance and are not causally linked to traits that differ between species or lineages. In order to test the hypothesis that a particular subset of loci or genes is responsible for driving adaptive changes between mammals and non-mammals, we developed a novel comparative approach to identify sites that are highly conserved within lineages or species groups and diverge between them. Loci with a high concentration of these sites may be called Shifts in Purifying Selection (SPurS) because a change has occurred between two groups of species at some point in the past, and the shift is conserved (via purifying selection) over a long period of time. Evaluating 7484 orthologous gene copies from 76 vertebrate species, we developed an empirical distribution of SPurS across the genome between Synapsida (placental and non-placental mammals) and Sauropsida (birds, crocodilians, squamates, and turtles), and compared this distribution to the expected null distribution of SPurS using matched simulated data. We then identified a subset of genes that is enriched for SPurS, relative to the full set of genes and to their matched simulated alignments. These SPurS-enriched genes are thus likely candidate drivers of functional divergence or adaptation between the mammalian and non-mammalian species groups in our analysis. Investigators seeking to identify genetic drivers of inter-species evolution may find this method useful, and we provide a web-based software interface to facilitate its use.","NA"

During sleep, the occurrence of hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), believed to mediate consolidation of explicit memories, is modulated by thalamocortical network activity, yet how information is routed around SWRs and how this communication depends on neuronal dynamics remains unclear. Here, by simultaneously recording ensembles of neurons in the anterior thalamus and local field potentials in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, we show that the head-direction (HD) cells of the anterodorsal nucleus are set in stable directions immediately before SWRs. This response contrasts with other thalamic cells that exhibit diverse couplings to the hippocampus related to their intrinsic dynamics but independent of their anatomical location. Thus, our data suggest a specific and homogeneous contribution of the HD signal to hippocampal activity and a diverse and cell-specific coupling of non-HD neurons.","NA"

Besides the actual execution of movements, the activation of mental representation of movements alone, or Motor Imagery (MI), is known to significantly engage motor networks. Based in such observation, MI should, at least in part, compensate for maladaptive neuroplasticity elicited by immobilization. Although highly relevant for clinical conditions associated with transient (e.g. after orthopedic injury) or chronic (e.g. after stroke) limb immobilization, this hypothesis and associated underlying neural mechanisms remain underexplored. Moreover, durable changes due to immobilization may also implicate sleep processes. To address these questions, here we investigated the potential benefits of MI practice during 11 h of unilateral arm-immobilization on the sensorimotor and cortical representations of the arms, as well as on subsequent sleep characteristics. Using a within-subjects design, fourteen participants were first tested after a normal day of motor activity (without immobilization, Baseline), followed by two randomized 11-hr conditions of immobilization of the right (dominant) arm, either with concomitant MI practice (15 min every two hours; MI) or without MI training but a neutral task during an equivalent time (NoMI), one week apart. At the end of each condition (Baseline, MI, NoMI), participants were tested on a hand laterality judgment task to assess changes in the sensorimotor representation of the hands, followed by a measure of cortical excitability of the primary motor cortices (M1). Polysomnography recordings were acquired during the subsequent night to assess condition-dependent modulations of sleep features. Data revealed that MI practice prevented the following consequences of arm immobilization: (i) alteration of the sensorimotor representation of hands, (ii) decrease of cortical excitability over M1 contralateral to arm-immobilization, (iii) reduction of sleep spindles over both M1s, and (iv) decrease in total time spent in REM sleep. Altogether, these results provide strong evidence that implementing MI within the context of limb-immobilization can substantially limit the deleterious effects of limb disuse, at several levels of sensorimotor functioning.

Arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) therapy exploits this metabolic vulnerability by depleting extracellular arginine, causing arginine starvation. ASS1-negative cells develop resistance to ADI-PEG20 through a metabolic adaptation that includes re-expressing ASS1. As arginine-based multiagent therapies are being developed, further characterization of the changes induced by arginine starvation is needed. In order to develop a systems-level understanding of these changes, activity-based proteomic profiling (ABPP) and phosphoproteomic profiling were performed before and after ADI-PEG20 treatment in ADI-PEG20-sensitive and resistant sarcoma cells. When integrated with previous metabolomic profiling (Kremer et al, 2017a), this multi-omic analysis reveals that cellular response to arginine starvation is mediated by adaptive ERK signaling, driving a Myc-Max transcriptional network. Concomitantly, these data elucidate proteomic changes that facilitate oxaloacetate production by enhancing glutamine and pyruvate anaplerosis, and altering lipid metabolism to recycle citrate for oxidative glutaminolysis. Based on the complexity of metabolic and cellular signaling interactions, these multi-omic approaches could provide valuable tools for evaluating response to metabolically targeted therapies.","NA"

Here, we analyze thousands of CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting, at several time-points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Strikingly, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immune-regulatory program to wound healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes, and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer.

In this study, we produced hMAb KPF1 in tobacco plants (KPF1-Antx) and demonstrate how the plant-produced KPF1-Antx hMAb possesses similar biological activity compared with the mammalian produced KPF1-HEK hMAb. KPF1-Antx hMAb shows broad binding to recombinant HA proteins and H1N1 IAV, including A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1) in vitro, that are comparable to those observed with KPF1-HEK hMAb. Importantly, prophylactic administration of KPF1-Antx hMAb to guinea pigs prevented pH1N1 infection and transmission in both prophylactic and therapeutic experiments, substantiating its clinical potential to prevent and treat H1N1 infections.

The S9.6 antibody recognizes RNA:DNA hybrids with a subnanomolar affinity, making it a broadly used tool to detect and study RNA:DNA hybrids. However, S9.6 also binds double-stranded RNA in vitro with significant affinity. Though frequently used in immunofluorescence microscopy, the possible reactivity of S9.6 with non-RNA:DNA hybrid substrates in situ, particularly RNA, has not been comprehensively addressed. Furthermore, S9.6 immunofluorescence microscopy has been methodologically variable and generated discordant imaging datasets. In this study, we find that the majority of the S9.6 immunofluorescence signal observed in fixed human cells arises from RNA, not RNA:DNA hybrids. S9.6 staining was quantitatively unchanged by pre-treatment with the human RNA:DNA hybrid-specific nuclease, RNase H1, despite experimental verification in situ that S9.6 could recognize RNA:DNA hybrids and that RNase H1 was active. S9.6 staining was, however, significantly sensitive to pre-treatments with RNase T1, and in some cases RNase III, two ribonucleases that specifically degrade single-stranded and double-stranded RNA, respectively. In contrast, genome-wide maps obtained by high-throughput DNA sequencing after S9.6-mediated DNA:RNA Immunoprecipitation (DRIP) are RNase H1-sensitive and RNase T1- and RNase III-insensitive. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the S9.6 antibody, though capable of recognizing RNA:DNA hybrids in situ and in vitro, suffers from a lack of specificity that precludes reliable imaging of RNA:DNA hybrids and renders associated imaging data inconclusive in the absence of controls for its promiscuous recognition of cellular RNAs.","NA"

However, the task of animal detection and tracking for videos taken in natural settings remains challenging due to heterogeneous environments.
C_LIO_LIWe present an open-source end-to-end pipeline called Multi-Object Tracking in Heterogenous environments (MOTHe), a python-based application that uses a basic convolutional neural network for object detection. MOTHe allows researchers with minimal coding experience to track multiple animals in their natural habitats. It identifies animals even when individuals are stationary or partially camouflaged.
C_LIO_LIMOTHe has a command-line-based interface with one command for each action, for example, finding animals in an image and tracking each individual. Parameters used by the algorithm are well described in a configuration file along with example values for different types of tracking scenario. MOTHe doesnt require any sophisticated infrastructure and can be run on basic desktop computing units.
C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate MOTHe on six video clips from two species in their natural habitat - wasp colonies on their nests (up to 12 individuals per colony) and antelope herds in four different types of habitats (up to 156 individuals in a herd).

To investigate the role of avid binding by B cells to the CSPRepeat in driving immunodominance we generated CSP9: a truncated CSP molecule with just 9 NANP repeats. Compared to near full length CSP molecules, CSP9 induced lower BCR signalling in CSPRepeat-specific cells and induced stronger responses to non-repeat epitopes. Finally, we found mice immunized with CSP9 molecules were strongly protected against mosquito bite challenge. Collectively these data demonstrate that the CSPRepeat does function as an immunodominant decoy and that truncated CSP molecules may be a promising avenue for future malaria vaccines.

Significance StatementMalaria kills approximately 420,000 individuals each year(1). Our best vaccine, RTS,S/AS01 is based on the circumsporozoite protein that coasts the surface of the parasite. However, this vaccine is only partially protective. Here we show that responses to a repeat region in the circumsporozoite dominate the immune response. However, immunizing with a circumsporozoite protein with a shortened repeat region induces a more diverse immune response, which could be an avenue to make better malaria vaccines.","NA"

Several studies have reported pathogen spillover of DWV from honey bees to bumble bees, but evidence of a true sustained viral infection has yet to be demonstrated. Here we investigate the infectivity and transmission of DWV in bumble bees using the buff-tailed bumble bee Bombus terrestris as a model. We apply a reverse genetics approach combined with controlled laboratory conditions to detect and monitor DWV infection. A novel reverse genetics system for three representative DWV variants, including the two master variants of DWV - type A and B - was used. Our results directly confirm DWV replication in bumble bees but also demonstrate striking resistance to infection by certain routes. Bumble bees may support DWV replication but it is not clear how infection could occur under natural environmental conditions.","NA"

In this study, we explore the nature of differences in the incidence of the number of hoof and leg disorders between Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle in the context of genetic heterogeneity between the breeds.

ResultsDespite potentially higher power of testing due to twice as large sample size, none of the SNPs was significantly associated with the number of hoof and leg disorders in Fleckvieh, while 16 SNPs were significant in Braunvieh. The most promising candidate genes in Braunvieh are: CBLB on BTA01, which causes arthritis in rats; CAV2 on BTA04, which in effects mouse skeletal muscles; PTHLH on BTA05, which causes disease phenotypes related to the skeleton in humans, mice and zebrafish; SORCS2 on BTA06, which causes decreased susceptibility to injury in the mouse. Some of the significant SNPs (BTA01, BTA04, BTA05, BTA13, BTA16) reveal allelic heterogeneity - i.e. differences due to different allele frequencies between Fleckvieh and Braunvieh. Some of the significant regions (BTA01, BTA05, BTA13, BTA16) correlate to inter-breed differences in LD structure and may thus represent false-positive heterogeneity. However, positions on BTA06 (SORCS2), BTA14 and BTA24 mark Braunvieh-specific regions.

ConclusionsWe hypothesise that the observed genetic heterogeneity of hoof and leg disorders is a by-product of multigenerational differential selection of the breeds - towards dairy production in the case of Braunvieh and towards beef production in the case of Fleckvieh. Based on the current data set it is no possibly to unequivocally confirm/exclude the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility to leg disorders between Fleckvieh and Braunvieh because only explore it through associations and not the causal mutations. Rationales against genetic heterogeneity comprise a limited power of detection of true associations as well as differences in the length of LD blocks and in linkage phase between breeds. On the other hand, multigenerational differential selection of the breeds and no systematic differences in LD structure between the breeds favour the heterogeneity hypothesis at some of the significant sites.","NA"

Babbitt","Rochester Institute of Technology","2020-01-13",1,"cc_by","new results","biophysics","Oncogenic mutations in the kinase domain of the B-Raf protein have long been associated with cancers involving the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. One constitutive ERK activating mutation in B-Raf, the V600E (valine to glutamate) replacement occurring adjacent to a site of threonine phosphorylation (T599) occurs in many types of cancer, and in a large percentage of certain cancers, such as melanoma. Because natural ATP binding activity and the V600E mutation are both known to alter the physical behavior of the activation loop in the ATP binding domain, this system is especially amenable to comparative functional analyses using molecular dynamics of drug classes and genetic variants at all-atom resolution. Here, we employ machine learning enabled identification of functionally conserved protein dynamics to compare how disease pertinent molecular variations impact conserved loop dynamics during the binding of four ATP competitive B-Raf inhibitors (sorafenib, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and PLX7904) that differ in their effectiveness in preventing cancer recurrence. We demonstrate that drug development targeting B-Raf has progressively moved towards ATP competitive inhibitors that demonstrate less tendency to mimic the functional dynamic shifts associated with ATP binding in this domain. We argue this functional dynamic mimicry in first generation B-Raf inhibitors increases the side effect of hyperactivation (i.e. inducing MAPK activation in non-tumorous cells in the absence of secondary mutation). Within the context of the binding interaction of each inhibitor, we compare the functional dynamic impacts of V600E and other sensitizing and drug resistance causing mutations in the activation and P-loops, confirming sites of low mutational tolerance in these two functional regions. Lastly, we investigate V600E sensitivity of B-Raf loop dynamics in an evolutionary context, demonstrating that while it probably shares partial origin with its early evolution in primitive eukaryotes, the functional sensitivity to V600E was secondarily increased during early jawed vertebrate evolution.

Author SummaryOur lab has recently developed a combined simulation-based and machine learning method and user-friendly software for identifying dynamic motions in proteins that are preserved over evolutionary time scales (i.e. are functionally conserved). Our method also can assess how genetic or chemical variation affects these functionally conserved motions. Here, we utilize this approach to computationally demonstrate how one of the most common mutations that arise in tumors, the V600E B-Raf protein mutation, disrupts the functioning of protein loop dynamics responsible for normal regulation of the oncogenic B-Raf protein and its growth signaling pathway. We demonstrate that cancer recurrence in the absence of new mutations may be caused by drug interactions impacting these dynamics. We propose that mimicry of the functional dynamics of natural chemical activators (i.e. agonists) by many cancer targeting drugs may be a potent causal factor in recurrence of cancer in the absence of secondary mutation. By combining comparative modeling of molecular dynamics and analyses of molecular evolution, we also demonstrate that the unusual sensitivity of B-Raf protein regulatory loop dynamics to this mutation has an ancient evolutionary origin.","NA"

Based on surveys conducted over one spawning period (2016), we set out to: (1) describe the composition and abundance of drifting fish eggs in the 150 km Lainbin section under a dam control, and (2) analyze how the composition and distribution of fish eggs was correlated with environmental factors. A total of 15157 eggs belonging to two orders, four families, and 18 species were collected. Comparison of these data with historical records in the same area showed that the community structure of drifting eggs has changed considerably.

AUTHOR SUMMARYBacterial predation is an interspecific relationship widely extended in nature. Among other predators, Bdellovibrio and like organism (BALOs) have received recently a great attention due to the high potential applications such as biocontrol agent in medicine, agriculture, aquaculture and water treatment. Despite the increasing interest in of this predatory bacterium its complex lifestyle and growth conditions hamper the full exploitation of their biotechnological properties. In order to overcome these important shortcomings, we provide here the first genome-scale model of a predator bacterium constructed so far. By using the model as a computational testbed, we provide solid evidences of the metabolic autonomy of this interesting bacterium in term of growth, as well as its dynamic metabolism powering the biphasic life style of this predator. We found a low metabolic robustness thus suggesting that Bdellovibrio is more niche-specific than previously thought and that the environmental conditions governing predation may be relatively uniform. Overall, we provide here a valuable computational tool largely facilitating rational design of novel and controlled predator-based biocatalysts in biotechnological/clinical applications.","NA"

One of the challenging issues in ecology is how the interaction opportunity influences and provides changes to the associations between species, and which effects these changes have on ecological systems. To explore topological patterns in host-parasite networks, we sampled endoparasites-anurans interactions in South America in order to determine whether the effect of the ecological opportunity affects our understanding of the topological structure of the interaction networks. To identify the effect of the ecological opportunity for interaction, we investigated interactions in environments with and without flood pulse, where presence would promote higher ecological opportunity of interaction. Moreover, we created three theoretical models with filters to test the influence of the ecological opportunity for interaction: random, phylogeny and host body size. We then calculated commonly used binary network metrics (connectance, nestedness and modularity) for the networks generated by the theoretical models. We demonstrated that the interaction ecological opportunity changes the structure of host-parasite networks, and was influenced mainly by phylogeny and body size of the host. Our results indicate that environments that offer greater opportunities for interaction between species present networks with the most connectance/nestedness and less modularity. Networks in environments that do not have such opportunities for interaction depict the opposite pattern. Our results indicate that the ecological opportunity of interaction is reflected in an increase in interaction associations between species and affect/change the organization of these interactive assemblages. From an epidemiological point of view, changes in the composition of parasitic species are associated with risks of invasions and emerging diseases. In part, emerging diseases are the result of processes such as those occurring during the flood pulse, in which climate change, travel, and global trade create opportunities for new species associations. Our results provide insight into the dynamics of incorporating a new resource, considering an evolutionary factor responsible for these changes in species composition.","NA"

Budding yeast telomeres were proposed to fold back into subtelomeric regions, but a robust assay to quantitatively characterize this structure has been lacking. Therefore, it is not well understood how the interactions between telomeres and non-telomeric regions are established and regulated. We employ a telomeric chromosome conformation capture (Telo-3C) approach to directly analyze telomere folding and its maintenance in S. cerevisiae. We identify the histone modifiers Sir2, Sin3 and Set2 as critical regulators for telomere folding, which suggests that a distinct telomeric chromatin environment is a major requirement for the folding of yeast telomeres. We demonstrate that telomeres are not folded when cells enter replicative senescence, which occurs independently of short telomere length. Indeed, Sir2, Sin3 and Set2 protein levels are decreased during senescence and their absence may thereby prevent telomere folding. Additionally, we show that the homologous recombination machinery, including the Rad51 and Rad52 proteins, as well as the checkpoint component Rad53 are essential for establishing the telomere fold-back structure. This study outlines a method to interrogate telomere-subtelomere interactions at a single unmodified yeast telomere. Using this method, we provide insights into how the spatial arrangement of the chromosome end structure is established and demonstrate that telomere folding is compromised throughout replicative senescence.

Author summaryTelomeres are the protective caps of chromosome ends and prevent the activation of a local DNA damage response. In many organisms, telomeres engage in a loop-like structure which may provide an additional layer of end protection. As we still lack insight into the regulation of the folded telomere structure, we used budding yeast to establish a method to measure telomere folding and then study the genetic requirements for its establishment. We found that cells require the homologous recombination machinery as well as components of the DNA damage checkpoint to successfully establish a folded telomere. Through the deletion of telomerase in budding yeast, we investigated how telomere folding was regulated during replicative senescence, a process that occurs in the majority of telomerase negative human cells. During senescence, telomeres gradually shorten and erode until cells stop dividing which is a potent tumor suppressor and prevents unscheduled growth of potential cancer cells. We found, that the folded telomere structure is compromised as part of the cellular senescence response, but not due to telomere shortening per se. We think, that an altered telomeric chromatin environment during senescence is important to maintain an open state - which may be important for signaling or for repair.","NA"

However, the genes of these three RNAi families are largely unknown yet in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), though it is an economically important fruit plant all over the world. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation for genome-wide identification, characterization and diversity analysis of RNA silencing genes in C. sinensis was conducted and identified 4 CsDCL, 8 CsAGO and 4 CsRDR as RNAi genes. To characterize and validate the predicted genes of RNAi families, various bioinformatics analysis was conducted. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the predicted CsDCLs, CsAGOs and CsRDRs genes into four, six and four subgroups with the relevant genes of Arabidopsis respectively. The domain and motif composition analysis, the gene structure for all three-gene families exhibited almost homogeneity within the same group members while showed significant differences in between groups. The GO enrichment analysis results clearly indicated that the predicted genes have direct involvement into the RNAi process as expected in C. sinensis. Moreover, Cis-regulatory elements and regulatory transcription factor analysis of the reported RNAi genes demonstrated the diverse connection to the huge biological functions and regulatory pathways. The expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis showed that these genes are highly expressed in fruit and leaves which indicate that these reported genes have great involvement in C. sinensis food, flowering and fruit production.

Functional networks measured during ""resting"", or task-absent, state are correlated with cognitive function, and much development of these networks occurs between infancy and adulthood. However, RSFC research in the intermediate years (especially between ages 3 and 5 years) has been limited, mainly due to a paucity of child-appropriate neural measures and behavioral paradigms. This paper presents a new paradigm to measure RSFC in young children, utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Freeplay, a simple behavioral setup designed to approximate resting state in children. In Experiment 1, we recorded fNIRS data from children aged 3-8 years and adults aged 18-21 years and examined feasibility and validity of our measure of RSFC, and compared measures across the two groups. In Experiment 2, we recorded longitudinal data at two points (approximately 3 months apart) from children aged 3-5 years, and examined reliability under a variety of measures. In both experiments, all children were able to complete testing and provide usable data, a significant improvement over fMRI-based RSFC measurement in children. Results suggest this paradigm is practical and has good construct validity and test-retest reliability, and may contribute towards increasing the availability of reliable data on resting state networks in early childhood. In particular, these are some of the first positive results on the feasibility of reliably measuring functional connectivity in children aged 3-5 years.","NA"

Yeast prion systems are intrinsically multi-scale: the molecular chemical processes are indeed coupled to the cellular processes of cell growth and division to influence phenotypical traits, observable at the scale of colonies. We introduce a novel modeling framework to tackle this difficulty using impulsive differential equations. We apply this approach to the [PSI+] yeast prion, which associated with the misconformation and aggregation of Sup35. We build a model that reproduces and unifies previously conflicting experimental observations on [PSI+] and thus sheds light onto characteristics of the intracellular molecular processes driving aggregate replication. In particular our model uncovers a kinetic barrier for aggregate replication at low densities, meaning the change between prion or prion-free phenotype is a bi-stable transition. This result is based on the study of prion curing experiments, as well as the phenomenon of colony sectoring, a phenotype which is often ignored in experimental assays and has never been modeled. Furthermore, our results provide further insight into the effect of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) on Sup35 aggregates. To qualitatively reproduce the GdnHCl curing experiment, aggregate replication must not be completely inhibited, which suggests the existence of a mechanism different than Hsp104-mediated fragmentation. Those results are promising for further development of the [PSI+] model, but also for extending the use of this novel framework to other yeast prion or amyloid systems.

Author summaryIn the study of yeast prions, mathematical modeling is a powerful tool, in particular when it comes to facing the difficulties of multi-scale systems. In this study, we introduce a mathematical framework for investigating this problem in a unifying way. We focus on the yeast prion [PSI+] and present a simple molecular scheme for prion replication and a model of yeast budding. In order to qualitatively reproduce experiments, we need to introduce a non-linear mechanism in the molecular rates. This transforms the intracellular system into a bi-stable switch and allows for curing to occur, which is a crucial phenomenon for the study of yeast prions. To the best of our knowledge, no model in the literature includes such a mechanism, at least not explicitly. We also describe the GdnHCl curing experiment, and the propagon counting procedure. Reproducing this result requires challenging hypotheses that are commonly accepted, and our interpretation gives a new perspective on the concept of propagon. This study may be considered as a good example of how mathematical modeling can bring valuable insight into biological concepts and observations.","NA"

The 6249-cell atlas includes profiles of thyrocytes, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, immune cells and fibroblasts. Further, the thyrocytes could be split into two sub-populations with unique transcriptional signature, including differential expression of the transcription factor pax2a. To validate thyrocyte heterogeneity, we generated a CRISPR/Cas9-based pax2a knock-in line, which demonstrated specific pax2a expression in the thyrocytes.

Large conformational rearrangements accompany transport and allosterically couple substrate transport in the transmembrane region to dimerization of nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) nearly [~]30-40[A] away in the cytoplasm. How the two binding sites coordinate remains elusive, particularly in a class of ABC transporters with only one catalytically competent NBD, the asymmetric ABC transporters. The peptide transporter TmrAB from Thermus thermophilus is one such asymmetric transporter, and here we present biochemical evidence that substrate binding couples to ATP binding in nonequivalent ways through each half of the TmrAB heterodimer. Specifically, we show that this unique mechanism depends on a highly conserved electrostatic motif in a region previously termed the peptide sensor. In this conformationally dynamic region, we demonstrate that mutation of an absolutely conserved glycine in the catalytically active TmrA chain (G131A) accelerates ATPase activity while uncoupling substrate binding from ATP hydrolysis. Surprisingly, mutation of the conserved glycine in the non-functional TmrB chain (G116A) resulted in the opposite effect in which ATPase activity is decreased with little effect on substrate binding. Our findings highlight an intrinsic asymmetry extending beyond that of the NBDs in asymmetric ABC transporters and support a mechanism where the peptide sensor in each half of TmrAB plays different roles in substrate transport.","NA"

Neither method is perfect. Morpholinos (MOs) sometimes produce off-target or toxicity-related effects that can be mistaken for true phenotypes. Conversely, genetic mutants can be subject to compensation, or may fail to yield a null phenotype due to leakiness. When discrepancy between mutant and morpholino-induced (morphant) phenotypes is observed, experimental validation of such phenotypes becomes very labor intensive. We have developed a simple genetic method to differentiate between genuine morphant phenotypes and those produced due to off-target effects. We speculated that indels within 5 untranslated regions would be unlikely to have a significant negative effect on gene expression. Mutations induced within a MO target site would result in a Morpholino-refractive allele thus suppressing true MO phenotypes whilst non-specific phenotypes would remain. We tested this hypothesis on one gene with an exclusively zygotic function, tbx5a, and one gene with strong maternal effect, ctnnb2. We found that indels within the Morpholino binding site are indeed able to suppress both zygotic and maternal morphant phenotypes. We also observed that the ability of such indels to suppress Morpholino phenotypes does depend on the size and the location of the deletion. Nonetheless, mutating the morpholino binding sites in both maternal and zygotic genes can ascertain the specificity of morphant phenotypes.","NA"

Over time, declines in infectious disease continue but chronic and degenerative causes persist4,5, so we might expect under-5 deaths to be concentrated in the first month of life. However, little is known about the age-pattern of this transition in early mortality or its potential limits. Here we first describe the limit using detailed data on Denmark, Japan, France, and the USA-- developed countries with low under-5 mortality. The limiting pattern of under-5 deaths concentrates in the first month, but is surprisingly dispersed over later ages: we call this the early rectangularization of mortality. Then we examine the progress towards this limit of 31 developing countries from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)--the region with the highest under-5 mortality6. In these countries, we find that early deaths have large age-heterogeneities; and that the age patterns of death is an important marker of progress in the mortality transition at early ages. But a negative association between national income and under-5 mortality levels, confirmed here, does not help explain reductions in child mortality during the transition.","NA"

Dysregulation of these adhesion molecules have been genetically and functionally linked to various neurological disorders. Here we investigated the molecular structure and mechanism of ligand interactions for the postsynaptic SALM3 adhesion protein with its presynaptic ligand, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase {sigma} (PTP{sigma}). We solved the crystal structure of the dimerized leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain of SALM3, revealing the conserved structural features and mechanism of dimerization. Furthermore, we determined the complex structure of SALM3 with PTP{sigma} using small angle X-ray scattering, revealing a 2:2 complex similar to that observed for SALM5. Solution studies unraveled additional flexibility for the complex structure, but validated the uniform mode of action for SALM3 and SALM5 to promote synapse formation. The relevance of the key interface residues was further confirmed by mutational analysis with cellular binding assays and artificial synapse formation assays. Collectively, our results suggest that SALM3 dimerization is a pre-requisite for the SALM3-PTP{sigma} complex to exert synaptogenic activity.","NA"

To monitor the temporal dynamics of processing, we recorded multiple-unit firings of CA1 neurons in male rats experiencing one of four episodes for 10 min: restraint stress, social interaction with a female or male, or observation of a novel object. Before an experience, the neurons mostly exhibited sporadic firings with some synchronized ({approx} 50 ms) ripple-like firing events in habituated home cage. After experience onset, restraint or social interaction with other rats induced spontaneous high-frequency firings (super bursts) intermittently, while object observation induced the events inconsistently. Minutes after experience initiation, CA1 neurons frequently exhibited ripple-like firings with less-firing silent periods. The number of ripple-like events depended on the episode experienced and correlated with the total duration of super bursts. Experience clearly diversified multiple features of individual ripple-like events in an episode-specific manner, sustained for more than 30 min in the home cage.

Ex vivo patch clamp analysis further revealed experience-promoted synaptic plasticity. Compared with unexposed controls, animals experiencing the female, male, or restraint episodes showed cell-dependently increased AMPA- or GABAA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents, whereas contact with a novel object increased only GABAergic currents. Multivariate ANOVA in multi-dimensional virtual space revealed experience-specific super bursts with subsequent ripple-like events and synaptic plasticity, leading us to hypothesize that these factors are responsible for creating experience-specific memory. It is possible to decipher encrypted experience through the deep learning of the orchestrated ripple-like firings and synaptic plasticity in multiple CA1 neurons.","NA"

For this system, a pre-established population of genetically engineered lymphocyte repertoires was developed in which a particular antigen can exclusively activate its specific counter cell, enabling that specific cell to survive and multiply under a specific artificial environment and to destroy particular antigens. Two synthetic patterns were postulated based on CAR receptors and synNotch receptors, in which the antibody library took the place of the antigen-recognition region. The inhibited expression of the inducible caspase-9 suicide gene was coupled with the activation of the synthetic receptor, allowing the lymphocyte repertoire to co-evolve with the dynamic expression of antigens. Synthetic cell repertoire shows significant anti-tumour effect both in vitro and in vivo. Tumour specific killer cells were enriched within one month in vivo even for large repertoire with abundant diversity. In theory, if the diversity of the lymphocyte repertoire is sufficient, then this artificial system can be used for the treatment of any human disease.","NA"

This study aimed to identify the effect of short-term high intensity exercise on the proteome of the rat ACL and MCL using mass spectrometry. Sprague Dawley male rats (n=12) were split into equal groups of control and exercise animals, which were subjected to high intensity training and followed by proteomic analysis of the ACL and MCL. Knee joint and ligament health was assessed using OARSI scoring or using a validated histological scoring system. Histopathological analyses demonstrated no significant changes in the ACL, MCL or cartilage of the knee joint, indicating that the exercise regime used in this study did not have substantial impact on tissue structure and health of several tissues within the rat knee joint. Some proteins were found to be significantly more abundant in the ACL in the exercised group than the control group. However, no proteins with a significantly different expression were identified between MCL control and MCL exercised groups. The majority of proteins expressed at higher levels in the ACL exercise group were cytoskeletal proteins, ribosomal proteins and enzymes. Several matrisomal proteins were also more abundant such as collagen proteins and proteoglycans in ACL exercise group. In conclusion, our results indicate that short-term high intensity exercise has an impact on ACL ECM protein expression, with the majority of differential expressed proteins being cellular proteins such as actins, ribosomal and heat shock proteins, indicative of metabolic and molecular responses.

NURK1 here was identified as the kinase affecting this phospho-switch through phosphorylation of NRT2.1 at S21 leading to inactivation of NRT2.1.","NA"

It is therefore critical to effectively address batch effects in genomic data. Many existing methods for batch effect adjustment assume continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian distributions for data. However in RNA-Seq studies where data are skewed, over-dispersed counts, this assumption is not appropriate and may lead to erroneous results. Negative binomial regression models have been used to better capture the properties of counts. We developed a batch correction method, ComBat-Seq, using negative binomial regression. ComBat-Seq retains the integer nature of count data in RNA-Seq studies, making the batch adjusted data compatible with common differential expression software packages that require integer counts. We show in realistic simulations that the ComBat-Seq adjusted data result in better statistical power and control of false positives in differential expression, compared to data adjusted by the other available methods. We further demonstrated in a real data example where ComBat-Seq successfully removes batch effects and recovers the biological signal in the data.","NA"

Here, we used a machine learning approach to develop a sensitive pan-cancer Classifier of HOmologous Recombination Deficiency (CHORD). CHORD employs genome-wide genomic footprints of somatic mutations characteristic for HRD and that discriminates BRCA1- and BRCA2-subtypes. Analysis of a metastatic pan-cancer cohort of 3,504 patients revealed HRD to occur at a frequency of 6% with highest rates for ovarian cancer (30%), comparable frequencies for breast, pancreatic and prostate cancer (12-13%) and incidental cases in other cancer types. Ovarian and breast cancer were equally driven by BRCA1- and BRCA2-type HRD, whereas for prostate, pancreatic and urinary tract cancers BRCA2-type HRD was predominant. Biallelic inactivation of BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C and PALB2 were found as the most common genetic causes of HRD (60% of all CHORD-HRD cases), with RAD51C and PALB2 inactivation resulting in BRCA2-type HRD. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found to be the main inactivating mechanism in ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancer, whereas for prostate cancer deep deletions (primarily of BRCA2) are also a major cause. From the remaining 40% of CHORD-HRD patients, 35% had a monoallelic mutation in one of the HRD associated genes, suggesting that the second allele could be inactivated by epigenetic or regulatory mechanisms. For only 5% of CHORD-HRD patients, no mutations were identified that could explain the HRD phenotype. Taken together, our results demonstrate that broad genomics-based HRD testing is valuable for cancer diagnostics and could be used for patient stratification towards treatment with e.g. poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi).","NA"

P.","Jelmer P Borst","University of Groningen","2020-01-14",2,"cc_by_nc_nd","new results","neuroscience","In this paper, we present a functional spiking-neuron model of human working memory (WM). This model combines neural firing for encoding of information with activity-silent maintenance. While it used to be widely assumed that information in WM is maintained through persistent recurrent activity, recent studies have shown that information can be maintained without persistent firing; instead, information can be stored in activity-silent states. A candidate mechanism underlying this type of storage is short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP), by which the strength of connections between neurons rapidly changes to encode new information. To demonstrate that STSP can lead to functional behavior, we integrated STSP by means of calcium-mediated synaptic facilitation in a large-scale spiking-neuron model and added a decision mechanism. The model was used to simulate a recent study that measured behavior and EEG activity of participants in three delayed-response tasks. In these tasks, one or two visual gratings had to be maintained in WM, and compared to subsequent probes. The original study demonstrated that WM contents and its priority status could be decoded from neural activity elicited by a task-irrelevant stimulus displayed during the activity-silent maintenance period. In support of our model, we show that it can perform these tasks, and that both its behavior as well as its neural representations are in agreement with the human data. We conclude that information in WM can be effectively maintained in activity-silent states by means of calcium-mediated STSP.

Author SummaryMentally maintaining information for short periods of time in working memory is crucial for human adaptive behavior. It was recently shown that the human brain does not only store information through neural firing - as was widely believed - but also maintains information in activity-silent states. Here, we present a detailed neural model of how this could happen in our brain through short-term synaptic plasticity: rapidly adapting the connection strengths between neurons in response to incoming information. By reactivating the adapted network, the stored information can be read out later. We show that our model can perform three working memory tasks as accurately as human participants can, while using similar mental representations. We conclude that our model is a plausible and effective neural implementation of human working memory.","NA"

Here we reveal an unexpected link between the TNF (tumour necrosis factor) inflammatory pathway, triggered by the metalloprotease ADAM17/TACE, and a lipid droplet (LD)-mediated mechanism of protecting retinal cells from age related degeneration. Loss of ADAM17, TNF and the TNF receptor Grindelwald in pigmented glial cells of the Drosophila retina leads to age related degeneration of both glia and neurons, preceded by an abnormal accumulation of glial LDs. We show that the glial LDs initially buffer the cells against damage caused by neuronally generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), but that in later life the LDs dissipate, leading to the release of toxic peroxidated lipids. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of a conserved pathway in human iPS-derived microglia-like cells, which are central players in neurodegeneration. Overall, we have discovered a pathway mediated by TNF signalling acting not as a trigger of inflammation, but as a cytoprotective factor in the retina.","NA"

ResultsWe compared simplePHENOTYPES to other simulation packages and we showed that, under comparable circumstances, all packages produce equivalent results. Using standard GWAS software (GEMMA), we confirmed that the genetic signal is correctly simulated under different genetic architectures.

Methods such as comparing observed and expected heterozygosity are frequently used for identifying collapsed paralogs, but have limitations in genotyping-by-sequencing datasets, in which observed heterozygosity is difficult to estimate due to undersampling of alleles. These limitations are especially pronounced when the species is highly heterozygous or the expected inheritance is polysomic. We introduce a novel statistic, Hind/HE, that uses the probability of sampling reads of two different alleles at a sample*locus, instead of observed heterozygosity. The expected value of Hind/HE is the same across all loci in a dataset, regardless of read depth or allele frequency. In contrast to methods based on observed heterozygosity, it can be estimated and used for filtering loci prior to genotype calling.

There are two models: (i) the selective sweeps that reduces the genetic diversity at linked sites and elevates the divergence rate; and (ii) the background selection that reduces the genetic diversity at linked sites and divergence rate. An intriguing question, yet highly controversial, is which one is dominant. In this paper, I develop a framework of generalize background selection, formulated by a diffusion model with two killing functions: the one associated with (negative) background selection is the rate to stop a fixation process of a mutation randomly, and the other associated with positive background selection (selective sweep) is the rate to stop a loss process of a mutation randomly. A simple relationship between the level of reduced diversity and the rate of divergence is derived, depending on the strength of generalized background selection (G) and the proportion of positive background selection ({beta}). We analyzed the interspecies divergence and intra-population diversity in low-recombination regions of three organisms (fruitfly, soybean and human). Strikingly, all datasets demonstrated the dominance of (negative) background selection, and the positive background selection (selective sweeps) only has a small contribution ({beta}[~]10%). However, our analysis rejects the notion of {beta}=0, namely, a complete negative background selection is unlikely. These findings may shed some lights on the long-term debates around Neutral Theory.","NA"

A typical feature of these models is that the spatial and temporal distribution of the signalling molecule density is reported by solving a reaction-diffusion equation. However, the spatial and temporal distributions of such signalling molecules are not often reported or observed experimentally. This leads to a mismatch between the amount of experimental data available and the complexity of the mathematical model used to simulate the experiment. To address this mismatch, we develop a discrete model of cell migration that can be used to describe a new suite of co-culture cell migration assays involving two interacting subpopulations of cells. In this model, the migration of cells from one subpopulation is regulated by the presence of signalling molecules that are secreted by the other subpopulation of cells. The spatial and temporal distribution of the signalling molecules is governed by a discrete conservation statement that is related to a reaction-diffusion equation. We simplify the model by invoking a steady state assumption for the diffusible molecules, leading to a reduced discrete model allowing us to describe how one subpopulation of cells stimulates the migration of the other subpopulation of cells without explicitly dealing with the diffusible molecules. We provide additional mathematical insight into these two stochastic models by deriving continuum limit partial differential equation descriptions of both models. To understand the conditions under which the reduced model is a good approximation of the full model, we apply both models to mimic a set of novel co-culture assays and we systematically explore how well the reduced model approximates the full model as a function of the model parameters.","NA"

In the wild banana species Musa itinerans where the Taiwanese populations were ancient immigrants from the Chinese populations, new mutations exert larger effect size in precipitation-related variables, where Taiwan contains extreme environments beyond the ancestral climatic range, and new alleles have stronger association with novel environments. For temperature-related variables where Taiwan is within the ancestral climatic range, standing variants are more important than new mutations. The effect sizes of adaptive variants therefore differ under distinct environmental pressures, supporting theoretical predictions that natural selection favors new mutations with larger effect sizes in novel environments where the population is far from the adaptive peak. Despite their importance, large-effect variants also have higher mismatch and may be more vulnerable to future environmental perturbation, leaving minor-effect variants the main source of adaptive response to rapid anthropogenic climate change. Our work provides a support in natural environment to the previous conclusions from theoretical modeling and microbial experiments in well-controlled lab conditions.","NA"

Here we investigated how flaviviruses exploit the Src family kinases (SFKs) for exit from infected cells. We isolated three members of the SFK family - Src, Fyn and Lyn - that were specifically activated during secretion of Dengue and Zika or their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs blocked virus secretion, most significantly upon Lyn-deficiency. Lyn-/- cells were severely impaired in virus release, and were rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We further established that Lyn, via its palmitoylation-dependent membrane association, triggered post-Golgi virus transport in specialised Rab11 and Transferrin receptor positive organelles resembling secretory autophagosomes, and distinct from conventional exocytic vesicles. In the absence of Lyn activity or its aberrant membrane association, virions were sorted into the lysosomal pathway for degradation. This mode of export was specifically triggered by processed, and mature, but not by furin-resistant virus particles, and occurred with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway. Our study therefore charts a previously undiscovered Lyn-dependent exit strategy, triggered by flaviviruses in secretory autophagosomes that might enable them to evade circulating antibodies and dictate tissue tropism.","NA"

Theta rhythm and running speed were strongly coupled to brain hemodynamics in multiple structures, with delays ranging from 0.8 seconds to 1.8 seconds. Surprisingly, hemodynamics was also strongly modulated across trials within the same recording session: cortical hemodynamics sharply decreased after 5-10 runs, while hippocampal hemodynamics strongly and linearly potentiated, particularly in the CA regions. This effect occurred while running speed and theta activity remained constant, and was accompanied by increased power in hippocampal high-frequency oscillations (100-150 Hz). Our findings reveal distinct vascular subnetworks modulated across fast and slow timescales and suggest strong adaptation processes despite stereotyped behavior.","NA"

ApoE binds the receptor sortilin which mediates uptake of apoE-bound cargo into neurons.

METHODSCombining neurolipidomics in patient specimens with functional studies in mouse models, we interrogated apoE isoform-specific functions for sortilin in brain lipid metabolism and AD.

RESULTSSortilin directs uptake and conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids into endocannabinoids, lipid-based neurotransmitters that act through nuclear receptors to sustain neuroprotective gene expression in the brain. This sortilin function requires apoE3, but is disrupted by binding of apoE4, impairing endocannabinoid signaling and increasing amyloidogenic processing.

In recent work, we developed a task that enabled the dissociation of the selection and execution components of an upper limb reaching movement. Our results demonstrated that both selection and execution are concommitently enhanced by immediate reward availability. Here, we investigate what the neural underpinnings of each component may be. To this end, we disrupted activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and supplementary motor area using continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) in a within-participant design (N=23). Both cortical areas are involved in reward processing and motor control, and we hypothesised that disruption of their activity would result in disruption of the reward-driven effects on action selection and execution, respectively. To increase statistical power, participants were pre-selected based on their sensitivity to reward in the reaching task. While reward did lead to enhanced perforance during the cTBS sessions and a control sham session, cTBS was ineffective in altering these effects.

In this study, we demonstrated that FLCN controled cell proliferation, invasion and migration through PI3K/mTORC2 pathway. FLCN combined with HIF2 in various normal and cancerous renal cells, and mTORC2 mediate FLCN effectively alleviated the deterioration of renal cancer cells by degrading HIF2.

We previously showed that cardiac-specific expression of {beta}3-AR inhibits the hypertrophic response to neurohormonal stimulation. Here, we further analyzed signalling pathways involved in the anti-hypertrophic effect of {beta}3-AR.

MethodsIn vitro hypertrophic responses to phenylephrine (PE) were analyzed in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing the human {beta}3-AR (AdVh{beta}3). We confirmed results in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific moderate expression of human {beta}3-AR ({beta}3-TG) and WT littermates submitted to thoracic transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 9 weeks.

ResultsWe observed a colocalization of {beta}3-AR with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) both in neonatal rat andin adult mouse cardiomyocytes. Treatment of NRVM with PE induced hypertrophy and a decrease in phosphorylation of Thr172-AMPK (/2, p=0.0487) and phosphorylation of Ser79- acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (/2.6, p=0.0317), inducing an increase in phosphorylated Ser235/236 S6 protein (x2.5, p=0.0367) known to be involved in protein synthesis. These effects were reproduced by TAC in WT mice, but restored to basal levels in {beta}3-AR expressing cells/mice. siRNA targeting of AMPK partly abrogated the anti-hypertrophic effect of {beta}3-AR in response to PE in NRVM (x1.3, p<0.0001). Concomitant with hypertrophy, autophagy measured by microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II/LC3-I ratio and p62 abundance was decreased by PE in NRVM (/2.6, p=0.0010 and x3, p=0.0016, respectively) or TAC in WT mice (/5.4, p=0.0159); and preserved in human {beta}3-AR expressing cells and mice, together with reduced hypertrophy.

ConclusionsCardiac-specific moderate expression of {beta}3-AR inhibits the hypertrophic response in part through AMPK activation followed byinhibition of protein synthesis and preservation of autophagy. Activation of the cardiac {beta}3-AR pathway may provide future therapeutic avenues for the modulation of hypertrophic remodelling.","10.1002/ehf2.12648"

Given the anatomical-functional laterality bias of the motor system, it is plausible that the pattern of such behavioral and neural sensory modulations will exhibit a similar bias, depending on the effector that was used to trigger the stimulus (e.g. right / left hand). Here we examined this issue in the visual domain using behavioral and neural measures (fMRI). Healthy participants judged the relative brightness of identical visual stimuli that were either self-triggered (using right or left hand button presses), or triggered by the computer. By presenting stimuli to either the right or left visual field, we biased visual-evoked responses to left / right visual cortex. We found stronger perceptual modulations when the triggering hand was ipsi (rather than contra) lateral to the stimulated visual field. At the neural level, we found that despite identical physical properties of the visual consequence, evoked fMRI responses in right and left visual cortices differentiate the identity of the triggering hand (left / right).

The spatial extent of the perturbation to the surrounding lipids during pore formation is relatively unexplored. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the changes in the structure and dynamics of lipids in a 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) lipid bilayer in the presence of contrasting PFTs. Cytolysin A (ClyA) an  toxin with its inserted wedge shaped bundle of inserted  helices induces significant asymmetry across the membrane leaflets in comparison with  hemolysin (AHL) a {beta} toxin. Despite the differences in hydrophobic mismatch and uniquely different topologies of the two oligomers, perturbation to lipid order as reflected in the tilt angle and order parameters, and membrane thinning is short ranged, lying within [~] 2.5 nm from the periphery of the either pore complex, commensurate with distances typically associated with van der Waals forces. In contrast, the spatial extent of perturbations to the lipid dynamics extend outward to at least 4 nm for both proteins, and the continuous survival probabilities reveal the presence of a tightly bound shell of lipids in this region. Displacement probability distributions show long tails and the distinctly non-Gaussian features reflect the induced dynamic heterogeneity. A detailed profiling of the protein-lipid contacts with residues tyrosine, tryptophan, lysine and arginine show increased non-polar contacts in the cytoplasmic leaflet for both PFTs, with a higher number of atomic contacts in the case of AHL in the extracellular leaflet due to the mushroom-like topology of the pore complex. The short ranged nature of the perturbations observed in this simple one component membrane suggests an inherent plasticity of membrane lipids enabling recovery of structure and membrane fluidity even in the presence of these large oligomeric trans-membrane protein assemblies. This observation has implications in membrane repair processes such as budding or vesicle fusion events used to mitigate PFT virulence, where the underlying lipid dynamics and fluidity in the vicinity of the pore complex are expected to play an important role.","NA"

Using live-cell super-resolution imaging, we are able to distinguish Hfq binding to different sizes of cellular RNAs. We demonstrate that under normal growth conditions, Hfq exhibits widespread mRNA binding activity. Particularly, the distal face of Hfq contributes mostly to the mRNA binding in vivo. In addition, binding of Hfq to these mRNAs can recruit RNase E to promote turnover of these mRNAs in an sRNA-independent manner, providing one mechanism to release Hfq from the pre-bound mRNAs. Finally, our data indicate that sRNAs, once expressed, can either co-occupy Hfq with the mRNA or displace the mRNA from Hfq, suggesting mechanisms through which sRNAs rapidly access Hfq to induce sRNA-mediated gene regulation.

MCTP is present only in non-chordates, while MCTP-1 and MCTP-2 are present in chordates. MCTP genes emerged early in metazoan evolution and are well conserved across species including humans. Genomic analysis of diverse species of representative phyla showed that the three C2 domains (C2A-C2C) and transmembrane regions (TMR) are well conserved. The C2 domains have eight {beta} strands as well as aspartate residues known to bind calcium. Interestingly, we identified a lysine-rich cluster, also known as polybasic cluster in C2A and C2B, which is known to bind lipids in other proteins. We also describe the phylogenetic distribution of MCTPs and analyze conserved domains and their predicted secondary structure in metazoans. We highlight important motifs that have not been previously described in MCTPs C2A and C2B domains that suggest MCTPs potentially bind phospholipids. Our observations show MCTPs are proteins widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms and may play an important role in membrane fusion or exocytosis.","NA"

Furthermore, for neutrophils, it has been suggested that barotaxis overrides chemotaxis. Here, we investigate whether Dictyostelium cells also respond to hydraulic resistance or primarily to chemical gradients using an asymmetric bifurcating micro-channel. This channel design allows us to decouple hydraulic and chemical stimuli, by providing a choice between moving up a chemical gradient or down a chemical gradient into a channel with 100 times lower hydraulic resistance. Under these conditions chemotaxis always overrides barotaxis. Cells confronted by a microchannel bifurcation are observed to often partially split their leading edge and to start moving into both channels. Cells in steeper cAMP gradients, that move faster, split more readily. The decision to retract the pseudopod moving away from the cAMP source is made when the average velocity of the pseudopod moving up the cAMP gradient is 20% higher than the average velocity of the pseudopod moving down the gradient. Surprisingly, this decision threshold is independent of the steepness of the cAMP gradient and speed of movement. It indicates that a critical force imbalance threshold underlies the repolarisation decision.

Significance StatementWe investigate the directional  decision-making of Dictyostelium discoideum cells migrating within engineered micro-channels harbouring asymmetric bifurcations. Unlike neutrophils and immature dendritic cells, Dictyostelium cells strongly prioritise chemical over barotactic guidance cues. Cells in steeper cAMP gradients migrate at higher speeds, split their leading edges more readily when confronted with a bifurcation in the channel. The decision to retract a pseudopod pointing in an unfavourable direction occurs when a critical tension gradient between two competing pseudopods is surpassed. These experiments show that although barotaxis is not a major guidance cue, cellular mechanics plays a major role in leading edge dynamics, including front splitting and polarisation and retraction.","NA"

Using liquid phase electron microscopy (LPEM) the distribution of ORAI1 proteins was examined at rest and after SOCE-activation at nanoscale resolution. The analysis of over seven hundred thousand of ORAI1 positions showed that already at rest, a majority of the ORAI1 channels formed STIM-independent distinct supra-molecular clusters. Upon SOCE activation and in the presence of STIM proteins, ORAI1 assembled in micron-sized two-dimensional (2D) structures, such as the known punctae at the ER plasma membrane contact zones, but also in divergent structures such as strands, and ring-like shapes. Our results thus question the hypothesis that stochastically migrating single ORAI1 channels are trapped at regions containing activated STIM, and we propose instead that supra-molecular ORAI1 clusters fulfill an amplifying function for creating dense ORAI1 accumulations upon SOCE-activation.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEORAI1 proteins form channels mediating store operated Ca2+ entry, an important trigger for many cellular functions, especially in the immune system. ORAI1 channels at rest are assumed to be randomly distributed in the plasma membrane, while they accumulate into so-called ""punctae"" upon activation, where binding by STIM proteins activate the Ca2+ channels. Using liquid phase electron microscopy, we discovered that ORAI1 forms small, elongated and linear clusters indicating the existence of supramolecular assemblies. The role of such supramolecular organization of ORAI1 is possibly an amplifying function for the effective creation of ORAI1 accumulations in punctae, since the binding of only one ORAI1 protein would trap a multiple of channels.","NA"

The mechanisms underlying CTLs navigation are not well understood so far. Here we use a collagen assay as a model for the ECM and analyze the migration trajectories of primary human CTLs in collagen matrices with different concentrations. We observe different migration patterns for individual T cells. Three different motility types can be distinguished: slow, fast and mixed motilities. Slow CTLs remain nearly stationary within the collagen matrix and show slightly anti-persistent motility, while the fast ones move quickly and persistent (i.e. with not too large turning angles). The dynamics of the mixed type consists of periods of slow and fast motions; both states are persistent, but they have different persistencies. The dynamics can be well described by a two-state persistent random walk model. We extract the parameters of the model by analyzing experimental data. The mean square displacements predicted by the model and those measured experimentally are in very good agreement, without any fitting parameter. Potential reasons for the observed two-state motility are discussed. T cells dig the collagen during their migration and form channels, which facilitate the movement of other CTLs in the collagen network.","NA"

Recently, we demonstrated a mechanism by which TZDs improve insulin sensitivity distinct from receptor agonism and adipogenesis: reversal of obesity-linked phosphorylation of PPAR{gamma} at Serine 273. However, the role of this modification has not been tested genetically. Here we demonstrate that mice encoding an allele of PPAR{gamma} which cannot be phosphorylated at S273 are protected from insulin resistance, without exhibiting differences in body weight or TZD-associated side effects. Indeed, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments confirm improved insulin sensitivity, as evidenced by increased whole-body glucose uptake.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures extracranial magnetic fields originating from neuronal activity with very high temporal resolution, but requires source reconstruction to make neuroanatomical inferences from these signals. Many source reconstruction algorithms for task-based MEG data are available. However, no consensus yet exists on the optimum algorithm for resting-state data.

Here, we evaluated the performance of six commonly-used source reconstruction algorithms based on minimum-norm and beamforming estimates. In the context of human resting-state MEG, we compared the algorithms using quantitative metrics, including resolution properties of inverse solutions and explained variance in sensor-level data. Next, we proposed a data-driven approach to reduce the atlas from the Human Connectome Projects multimodal parcellation of the human cortex. This procedure produced a reduced cortical atlas with 250 regions, optimized to match the spatial resolution and the rank of MEG data from the current generation of MEG scanners.

For both voxel-wise and parcellated source reconstructions, we showed that the eLORETA inverse algorithm had zero localization error, high spatial resolution, and superior performance in predicting sensor-level activity. Our comprehensive comparisons and recommandations can serve as a guide for choosing appropriate methodologies in future studies of resting-state MEG.","NA"

Our speciation rate estimates were robust to the effects of both undescribed species and missing taxa.

Recent research indicates that puberty is a period of HPA-axis plasticity during which the effects of exposure to ELS on cortisol regulation may change. In particular, increases in the sex hormones that drive pubertal maturation, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone, may be implicated in pubertal recalibration of cortisol regulation. In the current study, we examined the associations among levels of objectively-rated threat-related ELS and salivary waking cortisol, DHEA, and testosterone in a sample of 178 adolescents (55% female) who were in early puberty at baseline (Tanner stages 1-3; mean Tanner stage[SD]=1.93[0.64]; mean age[SD]=11.42[1.04]) and were followed up approximately two years later (mean Tanner stage[SD]=3.46[0.86]; mean age[SD]=13.38[1.06]). Using multi-level modeling, we disaggregated the effects of between-individual levels and within-individual increases in pubertal stage and sex hormones on change in cortisol. Controlling for between-individual differences in average pubertal stage, the association between levels of cortisol and DHEA was more strongly positive among adolescents who evidenced greater within-individual increases in pubertal stage across time. Both higher average levels and greater within-individual increases in DHEA and testosterone were associated with increases in cortisol across time, indicating positive coupling of developmental changes in these hormones; however, coupling was attenuated in adolescents who were exposed to more severe threat-related ELS prior to puberty. These findings advance our understanding of the development of the HPA-axis and its association with childhood environmental risk during puberty.","10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104651"

In this study, we explored the contribution of these SVs to population structure across the North East Atlantic. We compared genome wide population structure using sets of RAD sequencing SNPs with the spatial structure of the SVs. We found that in contrast to the rest of the genome, the SVs were only weakly associated with an isolation-by-distance pattern. Indeed, both SVs showed important allele frequency differences associated with two different environmental gradients, with the same allele increasing both along the salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea, and the latitudinal gradient along the Norwegian coast. Nevertheless, both SVs were found to be polymorphic across most sampling sites, even in the Icelandic population inferred to originate from a different glacial refuge than the remaining populations from the European continental shelf.

The paralogous transcriptional cofactors Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ, also called WWTR1), the main downstream effectors of the Hippo signal transduction pathway, are emerging as pivotal determinants of malignancy in lung cancer. Traditionally, studies have tended to consider YAP and TAZ as functionally redundant transcriptional cofactors, with similar biological impact. However, there is growing evidence that each of them also possesses distinct attributes. Here, we sought to systematically characterize the division of labor between YAP and TAZ in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common histological subtype of lung cancer. Employing representative NSCLC cell lines, as well as patient-derived data, we show that the two paralogs orchestrate non-overlapping transcription programs in this cancer type: whereas YAP preferentially regulates gene sets associated with cell division and cell cycle progression, TAZ preferentially regulates genes associated with extracellular matrix organization. Concordantly, depletion of YAP, but not TAZ, leads to growth arrest, while YAP overexpression promotes cell proliferation. Likewise, depletion of TAZ, but not YAP, compromises cell migration, whereas TAZ overexpression enhances migration. Importantly, the differential effects of YAP vs TAZ on key cellular processes are also associated with differential response to anti-cancer therapies. Uncovering the different activities and downstream effects of YAP and TAZ may thus facilitate better stratification of lung cancer patients for anti-cancer therapies.","NA"

The rigidity of the confiner matches physiological conditions and enables passive medium renewal. It is compatible with time-lapse microscopy, in situ immunostaining, and standard molecular analyses, and can be used with both adherent and non-adherent cell lines. Cell proliferation of various cell lines (hematopoietic cells, MCF10A epithelial breast cells and HS27A stromal cells) was followed for several days up to confluence using video-microscopy and further documented by Western blot and immunostaining. Interestingly, even though the nuclear projected area was much larger upon confinement, with many highly deformed nuclei (non-circular shape), cell viability, assessed by live and dead cell staining, was unaffected for up to 8 days in the confiner. However, there was a decrease in cell proliferation upon confinement for all tested cell lines. The soft cell confiner is thus a valuable tool to decipher the effect of long-term confinement and deformation on the biology of cell populations. This tool will be instrumental in deciphering the impact of nuclear and cytoskeletal mechanosensitivity in normal and pathological conditions involving highly confined situations, such as those reported upon aging with fibrosis or during cancer.

Rapid, accurate identification of the likely cause is essential for clinical management and the early initiation of antimicrobial therapy, which potentially improves clinical outcome.

MethodsWe applied liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from a cohort of adults with/without CNS infections to discover potential diagnostic protein biomarkers. We then validated the diagnostic performance of a selected biomarker candidate in an independent cohort of 364 consecutively treated adults with CNS infections admitted to a referral hospital in southern Vietnam.

ResultsIn the discovery cohort, we identified lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as a potential biomarker of bacterial meningitis. The analysis of the validation cohort showed that LCN2 could discriminate bacterial meningitis from other CNS infections, including tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis and viral/antibody-mediated encephalitis (sensitivity: 0.88 (95% confident interval (CI): 0.77-0.94), specificity: 0.91 (95%CI: 0.88-0.94) and diagnostic odd ratio: 73.8 (95%CI: 31.8-171.4)). LCN2 outperformed other CSF markers (leukocytes, glucose, protein and lactate) commonly used in routine care worldwide. The combination of LCN2 and these four routine CSF markers resulted in the highest diagnostic performance for bacterial meningitis (area under receiver-operating-characteristic-curve 0.96; 95%CI: 0.93-0.99).

ConclusionsOur results suggest that LCN2 is a sensitive and specific biomarker for discriminating bacterial meningitis from a broad spectrum of CNS infections. A prospective study is needed to further assess the diagnostic utility of LCN2 in the diagnosis and management of CNS infections.","NA"

Here we employed a machine learning strategy, transfer learning, where knowledge from A. thaliana is transferred to predict gene functions in cultivated tomato with fewer experimentally annotated genes. The first tomato SM/GM prediction model using only tomato data performs well (F-measure=0.74, compared with 0.5 for random and 1.0 for perfect predictions), but from manually curating 88 SM/GM genes, we found many mis-predicted entries were likely mis-annotated.

Chemotaxis and cell-cell adhesion differences are believed to drive cell patterning during this critical period of organogenesis, but the spatiotemporal organization of this process is incompletely understood.

We applied a Cellular Potts model to explore to how these processes contribute to directed cell movement and aggregation. Model parameters were estimated based on fitting to experimental data obtained in ex vivo kidney explant and dissociation-reaggregation organoid culture studies.

Our simulations indicated that optimal enrichment and aggregation of NP cells in the UB corner niche requires chemoattractant secretion from both the UB epithelial cells and the NP cells themselves, as well as differences in cell-cell adhesion energies. Furthermore, NP cells were observed, both experimentally and by modelling, to move at higher speed in the UB corner as compared to the tip region where they originated. The existence of different cell speed domains along the UB was confirmed using self-organizing map analysis.

In summary, we demonstrated the suitability of a Cellular Potts Model approach to simulate cell movement and patterning during early nephrogenesis. Further refinement of the model should allow us to recapitulate the effects of developmental changes of cell phenotypes and molecular crosstalk during organ development.

Author SummaryThe emergence of tissue patterns during vertebrate development is a major interest of both experimental research and biocomputational modelling. In this study, we established a Cellular Potts Model to explore cellular processes during early kidney development. The goal was to elucidate movements and aggregations of nephron progenitor cells. These precursor cells derive from mesenchymal cells around the ureteric buds and eventually form the epithelial structure of the nephron. Moreover, we wanted to explore computationally the mechanisms how these cells segregate from metanephric mesenchyme and move towards the location where the nephron will be formed. Utilizing the Compucell3D simulation software, we developed a model which assumes that nephron progenitor movement and aggregation is governed by only two mechanisms, i.e. cell-cell adhesion differences between cell types and nephron progenitor cell chemotaxis in response to chemoattractant secretion from two sources. These sources were either the epithelial cells of a static ureteric bud and/or the nephron progenitor cells themselves. The simulations indicated faster average cell speeds near the ureteric bud corner, the target region of cell movement and aggregation, and slower speeds near the place of origin, the tip of ureteric bud. The results were validated by comparison of the model predictions with experimental data from two ex vivo embryonic kidney models and a computational optimization protocol.","NA"

We devised herein a completely opposite strategy from ""mouse to man"" by performing an aggressiveness screen and used functional genomics, imaging, clinical data and computational approaches in order to discover molecular pathways and players in renal cancer development and metastasis. Multiple cell lines for primary tumor growth, survival in the blood circulation and lung metastasis or metastatic spread from the primary tumor were generated and analyzed using a multi-layered approach which includes large-scale transcriptome, genome and methylome analyses. Transcriptome and methylome analyses demonstrated distinct clustering in three different groups. Remarkably, DNA sequencing did not show significant genomic variations in the different groups which indicates absence of clonal selection during the in vivo amplification process. Transcriptome analysis revealed distinct signatures of tumor aggressiveness which were validated in patient cohorts. Methylome analysis of full-length DNA allowed clustering of the same groups and revealed clinically relevant signatures. Furthermore, we identified SAA2 and CFB as soluble prognostic and predictive biomarkers of the therapeutic response. We also uncovered IL34 as another soluble prognostic biomarker and key regulator of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression. This was also functionally validated in vivo, and a mathematical model of IL34-dependent primary tumor growth and metastasis development was provided. These results indicate that such multilayered analysis in a RCC animal model leads to meaningful results that are of translational significance.

Deep sequencing viral populations at multiple time points allowed us to track the evolutionary dynamics of viral populations within and between hosts. High levels of viral genetic diversity were maintained in both plants and thrips between transmission events. Rapid fluctuations in the frequency of amino acid variants indicated strong host-specific selection pressures on proteins involved in viral movement (NSm) and replication (RdRp). While several genetic variants showed opposing fitness effects in different hosts, fitness effects were generally positively correlated between hosts indicating that positive rather than antagonistic pleiotropy is pervasive. These results suggest that high levels of genetic diversity together with the positive pleiotropic effects of mutations have allowed TSWV to rapidly adapt to new hosts and expand its host range.","NA"

In this study, we used colitis models for investigating extracellular-matrix dynamics during disease onset, while treating the matrix as a complete and defined entity. Through the analysis of matrix structure, stiffness and composition, we unexpectedly revealed that even prior to the first clinical symptoms, the colon displays its own unique extracellular-matrix signature and found specific markers of clinical potential, which were also validated in human subjects.

Because Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a potent activator of cGAS-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing, we set out to investigate a role for TRIM proteins in regulating macrophage responses to M. tuberculosis. Here we demonstrate that TRIM14, a non-canonical TRIM that lacks an E3 ligase RING domain, is a critical negative regulator of the type I IFN response in macrophages. We show that TRIM14 physically interacts with both cGAS and TBK1 and that macrophages lacking TRIM14 dramatically hyperinduce interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression following cytosolic nucleic acid transfection, IFN-{beta} treatment, and M. tuberculosis infection. Consistent with a defect in resolution of the type I IFN response, Trim14 knockout (KO) macrophages have more phospho-Ser754 STAT3 relative to phospho-727 and fail to upregulate the STAT3 target Socs3 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3), which is required to turn off IFNAR signaling. These data support a model whereby TRIM14 acts as a scaffold between TBK1 and STAT3 to promote phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 and enhance negative regulation of ISG expression. Remarkably, Trim14 KO macrophages hyperinduce antimicrobials like Inos2 and are significantly better than control cells at limiting M. tuberculosis replication. Collectively, these data reveal a previously unappreciated role for TRIM14 in resolving type I IFN responses and controlling M. tuberculosis infection.","NA"

Prior psychophysical studies in humans and electrophysiological studies in monkey IT are individually supportive of this hypothesis. However, due to differences in tasks and experience manipulations, it is not yet known if the reported plasticity of individual IT neurons and the reported human behavioral changes are quantitatively consistent. Here we tested that consistency by building an unsupervised plasticity model that captures the previously-reported IT neural plasticity and combined that model with a previously established IT-to-recognition-behavior linking model. We compared the predictions of the overall model with the results of three new human behavioral experiments: in each we delivered a different type of unsupervised temporal contiguity experience and longitudinally measured its effect on performance of targeted object discrimination tasks. We found that, without any parameter tuning, the overall model accurately predicted the mean direction, magnitude and time course of performance changes in all three of these experiments. We also found a previously unreported dependency of the observed human performance change on the initial difficulty of the targeted object discrimination task, which was also largely predicted by the overall model. This result demonstrates the interlocking consistency of a range of prior neural and behavioral work, and thus adds support to the hypothesis that tolerant core object recognition in human and non-human primates is instructed -- at least in part -- by naturally occurring unsupervised temporal contiguity experience.","NA"

The disease begins around the age of six months, with a febrile stage, characterized by febrile seizures with otherwise normal development. By the end of the first year of life, the disease progresses to the worsening stage, featuring recurrent intractable seizures and the appearance of additional comorbidities, including global developmental delay, cognitive deficits, hyperactivity and motor problems. Later, in early school years, Dravet reaches the stabilization stage, in which seizure burden decreases, while Dravet-associated comorbidities persist. Dravet syndrome mouse models (DS) faithfully recapitulate the three stages of the human syndrome. Here, we performed power spectral analyses of background EEG activity in DS and their wild-type (WT) littermates, demonstrating disease stage-related alterations. Specifically, while the febrile stage activity resembled that of WT mice, we observed a marked reduction in total power during the worsening stage and a smaller reduction during the stabilization stage. Moreover, low EEG power at the worsening stage correlated with increased risk for premature death, suggesting that such measurements can potentially be used as a marker for Dravet severity. With normal development at the febrile stage and the presentation of developmental delay at the worsening stage, the contribution of recurrent seizures to the emergence of Dravet-associated comorbidities is still debated. Thus, we further characterized the behavior of WT and DS mice during the different stages of Dravet. At the febrile stage, despite their normal background EEG patterns, DS mice already demonstrated motor impairment and hyperactivity in the open field, that persisted to the worsening and stabilization stages. Conversely, clear evidence for deficits in working memory emerged later in life, during the worsening stage. These results indicate that despite the mild epilepsy at the febrile stage, DS development is already altered, suggesting that the pathophysiological mechanisms governing the appearance of some Dravet behavioral comorbidities may be independent of the epileptic phenotype.

However, the same chord may be interpreted as having different harmonic functions, implying perceptual ambiguity. Hence, syntactic irregularity and perceptual ambiguity may be processed simultaneously. We devised 3 different 5-chord sequences in which the ending chord differed with the tonic (T), submediant (SM), and supertonic (ST). In terms of syntactic regularity, T is most regular, ST is most irregular. However, in terms of perceptual ambiguity, the most irregular ST had the salient highest voice. Therefore, the SM was the most ambiguous condition. We investigated how the human brain separates syntactic irregularity and perceptual ambiguity in terms of effective connectivity in bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFGs) and superior temporal gyri (STGs) with magnetoencephalography in 19 subjects. Correct rate was lower for the most ambiguous chord (SM) (P = 0.020) as expected. Connectivity from the right to the left IFG was enhanced for the most irregular chord (ST) (P = 0.024, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected), whereas connectivity from the right to the left STG was enhanced for the most ambiguous chord (SM) (P < 0.001, FDR corrected). The correct rate was negatively correlated with connectivity in the STG, further reflecting perceptual ambiguity (P = 0.026). We found that syntactic irregularity and perceptual ambiguity in music are dissociated in connectivity between bilateral IFGs and STGs, respectively.

Significance StatementWe provide the first neurophysiological evidence of the processing of perceptual ambiguity, other than syntactic irregularity, implied in musical chords. We found that the notion of ""perceptually ambiguity"" is applicable to musical chord stimuli different in syntactic irregularity, and that perceptual ambiguity is separate from syntactic irregularity. Our data demonstrate that the brain interprets the three conditions of musical chords as both ""from regular to irregular"" and ""from ambiguous to unambiguous"" conditions simultaneously.

Parallel tempering has long been used to speed up phylogenetic analyses and to make use of multi-core CPUs. Parallel tempering essentially runs multiple MCMC chains in parallel. All chains are heated except for one cold chain that explores the posterior probability space like a regular MCMC chain. This heating allows chains to make bigger jumps in phylogenetic state space. The heated chains can then be used to propose new states for other chains, including the cold chain. One of the practical challenges using this approach, is to find optimal temperatures of the heated chains to efficiently explore state spaces. We here provide an adaptive parallel tempering scheme to Bayesian phylogenetics, where the temperature difference between heated chains is automatically tuned to achieve a target acceptance probability of states being exchanged between individual chains. We first show the validity of this approach by comparing inferences of adaptive parallel tempering to MCMC on several datasets. We then explore where parallel tempering provides benefits over MCMC. We implemented this adaptive parallel tempering approach as an open source package licensed under GPL 3.0 to the Bayesian phylogenetics software BEAST2, available from https://github.com/nicfel/CoupledMCMC.","NA"

Besides their use in the worldwide production of tobacco leaves, they are also used as evolutionary model systems due to their complex development history, which is tangled by polyploidy and hybridization. Here, we assembled the plastid genomes of five tobacco species, namely N. knightiana, N. rustica, N. paniculata, N. obtusifolia and N. glauca. De novo assembled tobacco plastid genomes showed typical quadripartite structure, consisting of a pair of inverted repeats (IR) regions (25,323-25,369 bp each) separated by a large single copy (LSC) region (86,510 -86,716 bp) and a small single copy (SSC) region (18,441-18,555 bp). Comparative analyses of Nicotiana plastid genomes showed similar GC content, gene content, codon usage, simple sequence repeats, oligonucleotide repeats, RNA editing sites and substitutions with currently available Solanaceae genomes sequences. We identified twenty highly polymorphic regions mostly belonging to intergenic spacer regions (IGS), which could be appropriate for the development of robust and cost-effective markers to infer the phylogeny of genus Nicotiana and family Solanaceae. Our comparative plastid genome analysis revealed that the maternal parent of the tetraploid N. rustica was the common ancestor of N. paniculata and N. knightiana, and the later species is more closely related to N. rustica. The relaxed molecular clock analyses estimated that the speciation event between N. rustica and knightiana appeared 0.56 Ma (HPD 0.65-0.46). The biogeographical analysis showed a south-to-north range expansion and diversification for N. rustica and related species, where N. undulata and N. paniculata evolved in North/Central Peru, while N. rustica developed in Southern Peru and separated from N. knightiana, which adapted to the Southern coastal climatic regimes. We further inspected selective pressure on protein-coding genes among tobacco species to determine if this adaptation process affected the evolution of plastid genes. These analyses indicated that four genes involved in different plastid functions, such as DNA replication (rpoA) and photosynthesis (atpB, ndhD and ndhF), came under positive selective pressure as a result of specific environmental conditions. Genetic mutations of the following genes might have contributed to the survival and better adaptation during the evolutionary history of tobacco species.","NA"

Using stringent criteria of miRNA annotation, a set of 91 miRNAs were identified that comprised of 84 conserved, 7 novel miRNAs with 9 pairs being polycistronic. Further, eighteen legume specific and 13 chickpea specific miRNAs were also obtained that may have specific roles in symbiosis.

Mapping of miRNA reads to bacterial genomes helped to predict bacterial smallRNAs that may be putatively regulating host genes. Further for identification of in-vivo targets of miRNAs, 4 degradome libraries were sequenced. Analysis revealed 245 target transcripts that were specifically cleaved during nodule stages, with a significant number being transcription factors. qRT-PCR based expression profiling in different chickpea tissues was carried out to validate the antagonistic expression of the miRNA-target pairs.

Biogenesis of canonical miRNAs depend on the cytoplasmic processing of pre-miRNAs to mature miRNAs by the Dicer endoribonuclease. Once mature miRNAs are generated, the miRNA-induced silencing complex, or miRISC, incorporates one strand of miRNAs as a template for recognizing complementary target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to dictate post-transcriptional gene expression. Besides regulating miRNA biogenesis, Dicer is also part of miRISC to assist in activation of the complex. Dicer associates with other regulatory miRISC co-factors such as trans-activation responsive RNA-binding protein (Tarbp2) to regulate miRNA-based RNA interference. Although the functional role of miRNAs within epidermal keratinocytes have been extensively studied within embryonic and post-natal mouse skin, its contribution to the normal function of hair follicle bulge stem cells (BSCs) during post-natal hair follicle development is unknown. With this question in mind, we sought to ascertain whether Dicer-Tarpb2 plays a functional role within BSCs during induced anagen development by utilizing conditional knockout mouse models. Our findings suggest that Dicer, but not Tarbp2, functions within BSCs to regulate induced anagen (growth) development of post-natal hair follicles. These findings strengthen our understanding of miRNA-dependency within hair follicle cells to define a boundary for post-transcriptional gene regulation during anagen development.","NA"

Eleven healthy adult humans performed a joystick visuomotor adaptation task. Beta (15-25Hz) scalp EEG signals recorded over the motor cortex during a pre-movement preparatory phase were, on average, significantly reduced in amplitude during early adaptation trials compared to baseline or late adaptation trials (p=0.01).

Predation risk and wind-induced perturbations in the canopy may further impede the movement process. In the Australian stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum, first-instar nymphs hatch on the forest floor and disperse toward tree canopies in the daytime. Here, we address such vertical movements and associated sensory cues in E. tiaratum nymphs. Newly hatched nymphs ascend with high endurance, travelling >100 m within 60 minutes. Navigation toward open canopies is underpinned by negative gravitaxis, positive phototaxis, and visual responses to vertically oriented contrast patterns. Nymphal E. tiaratum also use directed jumping to cross air gaps, and respond to tactile stimulation and potential threat with a self-dropping reflex, resulting aerial descent. Post-hatch dispersal in E. tiaratum thus consists of visually mediated displacement both on vegetational structures and in the air; within the latter context, gliding is then an effective mechanism enabling recovery after predator- and perturbation-induced descent. These results further support the importance of a diurnal niche, in addition to the arboreal spatial niche, in the evolution of gliding in wingless arboreal invertebrates.

For nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, assemblages are mostly determined by filtering by the host as well as abiotic soil conditions. However, for legumes adapted to highly variable environments and nutrient-poor soils, filtering out rhizobial partners may not be an effective strategy to ensure symbiotic benefits. As a consequence, this can lead to net increases in rhizobial diversity driven by stochastic (neutral) assembly processes. Here, we addressed whether symbiotic promiscuity of rooibos (Aspalathus linearis Burm. Dahlgren), reflects increases in rhizobial diversity that are independent of the environmental conditions, following a neutral assembly. We performed a common garden experiment to assess whether root system size and location- and habitat-specific rhizobial propagule pools of rooibos affected rhizobial community diversity and composition. We found a dominance of drift in driving taxonomic turnover in the root nodule communities, but operating at different scales in the dominant Mesorhizobium symbionts and the rest of bacterial taxa. Specifically, drift triggered differentiation between the core rhizobial symbionts of rooibos due to dispersal limitation on a regional scale, whereas it dominated the assembly of non-dominant rhizobial taxa at the root level. This suggests the existence of a significant neutral component in rhizobial community assembly when selectivity by the host plant is low. We conclude that in this promiscuous legume neutral processes govern bacterial community root nodule community assembly, but that these operate at different scales in dominant and rare rhizobial symbionts of the plant.","NA"

These interactions are often seen as social feedback rules, whereby individuals copy the decisions they observe others making, creating a coherent group decision. The benefit of these behavioural rules to the individual agent can be understood as a transfer of information, whereby a focal individual learns about the world by gaining access to the information possessed by others. Previous studies have analysed this exchange of information by assuming that all agents share common goals. While differences in information and differences in preferences have often been conflated, little is known about how differences between agents underlying preferences affects the use and efficacy of social information. In this paper I develop a model of social information use by rational agents with differing preferences, and demonstrate that the resulting collective behaviour is strongly dependent on the structure of preference sharing within the group, as well as the quality of information in the environment. In particular, I show that strong social responses are expected by individuals that are habituated to noisy, uncertain environments where private information about the world is relatively weak. Furthermore, by investigating heterogeneous group structures I demonstrate a potential influence of cryptic minority subgroups that may illuminate the empirical link between personality and leadership.","NA"

A central step in denitrification is the reduction of nitrite to nitrous oxide by nitrite reductase NirS, an enzyme that requires the unique cofactor heme d1. While heme d1 biosynthesis is mostly understood, the role of the essential periplasmatic protein NirF in this pathway remains unclear. Here, we have determined crystal structures of NirF and its complex with dihydroheme d1, the last intermediate of heme d1 biosynthesis. We found that NirF forms a bottom-to-bottom {beta}-propeller homodimer and confirmed this by multi-angle light and small-angle X-ray scattering. The N-termini are immediately neighbored and project away from the core structure, which hints at simultaneous membrane anchoring via both N-termini. Further, the complex with dihydroheme d1 allowed us to probe the importance of specific residues in the vicinity of the ligand binding site, revealing residues not required for binding or stability of NirF but essential for denitrification in experiments with complemented mutants of a {Delta}nirF strain of P. aeruginosa.

However, predicting how community diversity and composition will change in the future remains challenging (Mouquet et al 2015). One recent approach is to use traits to mechanistically inform how environmental conditions affect performance (i.e., trait-environment relationships), under the assumptions that these measures relate to each other in predictive and general ways. Unfortunately, results have been inconsistent, ignore phenotypic plasticity, and rely heavily on observational data (Shipley et al 2016). We evaluated the predictability and generality of trait-environment relationships in a controlled experimental microcosm system of four daphniid species. We cultured each species along a stressful gradient (conspecific density), measuring performance (fecundity) and traits related to performance (body length, 2nd antenna length, eye diameter, relative growth rate, and age at first reproduction). Using structural equation models, we evaluated the role of traits in mediating changes in individual fecundity in response to conspecific density. We built models for each species separately considering within-species trait variation, and for all species together by considering all trait variation across the four species. Results from this controlled system highlight that the relationship between individual traits and the environment (conspecific density) is strong and predictive of performance (fecundity), both within- and across-species. However, the specific trait-environment relationships which predicted fecundity differed for each species and differed from the relationships observed in the interspecific model, suggesting a lack of generality. These results will inform and improve the use of traits as a tool for predicting how changing environments will impact species abundances and distributions.","NA"

To further quantify the association of domain segregation with gene regulation and differentiation, we analyzed in this study the distribution of genes of different tissue specificities along the linear genome, and found that the distribution patterns are distinctly different in forests and prairies. The tissue-specific genes (TSGs) are significantly enriched in the latter but not in the former and genes of similar expression profiles among different cell types (co-activation/repression) also tend to cluster in specific prairies. We then analyzed the correlation between gene expression and the spatial contact revealed in Hi-C measurement. Tissue-specific forest-prairie contact formation was found to correlate with the regulation of the TSGs, in particular those in the prairie domains, pointing to the important role gene positioning, in the linear DNA sequence as well as in 3D chromatin structure, plays in gene regulatory network formation.","NA"

Previously, we reported a mosaic distribution of viral antigens and nucleic acids at single-cell level in liver tissues of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and proposed a  three-stage model of HBV infection in vivo. Here, we explored whether the different stages at cellular level is functionally linked with fibrogenesis. We observed a tight spatial relationship between the invasion of collagen fibers and transitions from S-rich to DNA-rich stage. While S-rich cells mainly localized within minimally fibrotic tissue, DNA-rich cells were often closely surrounded by a milieu of stiffened extracellular matrix (ECM). cDNA microarray and subsequent validation analyses revealed that S-rich cells manifested elevated ribosomal proteins and oxidative phosphorylation genes in a disease phase-dependent manner. On the other hand, DNA-rich cells exhibited gradually deteriorated expression of hepatocyte-specific antigen and transcriptional regulator in parallel with the progression of hepatic fibrosis. Finally, during fibrogenesis, inflammatory genes such as IP-10 were found to be expressed in both portal infiltrated cells and surrounding parenchymal cells which resulted in suppressed antigen expression. Taken together, we propose that liver inflammation and accompanying fibrogenesis is spatially and functionally linked with the transition of virological stages at cellular level. These transitions occur possibly due to an altered hepatocyte transcription profile in response to a transformed ECM environment. The collective viral and host activities shape the histological alterations and progression of liver disease during CHB infection.","NA"

A central feature of amyloid fibrils is the existence of multiple structural polymorphs, which complicates the development of disease-relevant structure-function relationships. Developing these relationships requires new methods to control fibril structure. In this work, we demonstrate that mesoporous silicas (SBA-15) functionalized with hydrophobic (SBA-PFDTS) and hydrophilic groups (SBA-PEG) direct the aggregation kinetics and resulting structure of A{beta}1-40 fibrils. The hydrophilic SBA-PEG had little effect on amyloid kinetics while as-synthesized and hydrophobic SBA-PFDTS accelerated aggregation kinetics. Subsequently, we quantified the relative population of fibril structures formed in the presence of each material using electron microscopy. Fibrils formed from A{beta}1-40 exposed to SBA-PEG were structurally similar to control fibrils. In contrast, A{beta}1-40 incubated with SBA-15 or SBA-PFDTS formed fibrils with shorter cross-over distances that were more structurally representative of fibrils found in AD patient-derived samples. Overall, these results suggest that mesoporous silicas and other exogenous materials are promising scaffolds for the de novo production of specific fibril polymorphs of A{beta}1-40 and other amyloidogenic proteins.

Significance StatementA major challenge in understanding the progression of Alzheimers Disease lies in the various fibril structures, or polymorphs, adopted by Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}). Heterogenous fibril populations may be responsible for different disease phenotypes and growing evidence suggests that A{beta} fibrils formed in vitro are structurally distinct from patient-derived fibrils. To help bridge this gap, we used surface-functionalized mesoporous silicas to influence the formation of A{beta}1-40 fibrils and evaluated the distribution of resulting fibril polymorphs using electron microscopy (EM). We found that silicas modified with hydrophobic surfaces resulted in fibril populations with shorter cross-over distances that are more representative of A{beta} fibrils observed ex vivo. Overall, our results indicate that mesoporous silicas may be leveraged for the production of specific A{beta} polymorphs.","NA"

Multiple research efforts have been directed towards understanding how the metabolism and the product formation of this, and other acetogenic bacteria, can be directed towards increasing productivities and yields; nonetheless, transferring those findings to a particular set-up can prove challenging. This study used a well-established and robust fed-batch fermentation system with C. ljungdahlii to look into the effects of different fermentation pH profiles, gas flow, and the supplementation with additional yeast extract or cysteine on growth, product formation ratios, yields, and productivities, as well as gas consumption. Neither yeast extract nor cysteine supplementation had a noticeable impact on cell growth, product formation or overall gas consumption. The lowering of the pH proved mainly detrimental, with decreased productivities and no improvement in ethanol ratios. The most notable shift towards ethanol was achieved by the combination of lowering both the pH and the gas flow after 24 h, but with the caveat of lower productivity. The obtained results, unexpected to some extent, highlight the necessity for a better understanding of the physiology and the metabolic regulation of acetogenic bacteria in order for this process to become more industrially relevant.","NA"

One classical example is the coexistence of herbaceous and woody species in self-organised dryland vegetation patterns. Previous theoretical investigations have explained this phenomenon by making strong assumptions on the differences between grasses and trees (e.g. contrasting dispersal behaviours or different functional responses to soil moisture). Motivated by classical theory on competition models in population dynamics, I argue that the interplay between interspecific and intraspecific competition of a single species can explain species coexistence without relying on such assumptions. I use an ecohydrological reaction-advection-diffusion system that captures the interactions of two plant species with an explicitly modelled resource to show that coexistence is facilitated by strong intraspecific competition of one species only. Crucially, the inclusion of spatial self-organisation principles yields significant differences from the nonspatial case. In a spatially extended system, coexistence is facilitated by strong intraspecific dynamics of the species superior in its colonisation abilities if its competitor species has a higher local average fitness. In the nonspatial case, strong intraspecific competition of the locally superior species enables coexistence. Results presented in this paper also capture the empirically observed spatial species distribution within bands of vegetation and propose differences in plants dispersal behaviour as its cause.","NA"

Participants8,609 repeated observations from 3,098 children aged 2 to 16 years, examined between 2007 and 2014.

Main outcome measuresBody mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) to capture the inherited susceptibility of obesity were calculated using summary statistics from independent genome-wide association studies of BMI. Gene-environment interactions of the PRS with sociodemographic (European region, socioeconomic status) and lifestyle factors (diet, screen time, physical activity) were estimated.

ResultsThe PRS was strongly associated with BMI (r2 = 0.11, p-value = 7.9 x 10-81) and waist circumference (r2 = 0.09, p-value = 1.8 x 10-71) in our cohort. The associations with BMI increased from r2=0.03 in 3-year olds to r2=0.18 in 14-year olds and associations with waist circumference from r2=0.03 to r2=0.14. Being in the top decile of the PRS distribution was associated with 3.63 times higher odds for obesity (95% confidence interval (CI): [2.57, 5.14]). We observed significant interactions with demographic and lifestyle factors for BMI as well as waist circumference. The risk of becoming obese among those with higher genetic susceptibility was ~38% higher in children from Southern Europe (BMI: p-interaction = 0.0066, Central vs. Southern Europe) and ~61% higher in children with a low parental education (BMI: p-interaction = 0.0012, low vs. high). Furthermore, the risk was attenuated by a higher intake of dietary fiber (BMI: p-interaction=0.0082) and shorter screen times (BMI: p-interaction=0.018).

While the microbiome is increasingly recognized as a key determinant of gut health and human development, the impact of naturally-acquired parasite infections on microbial community structure in the gut, and the extent to which parasite-induced changes in the microbiome may contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms, is poorly understood. Enteric parasites are routinely identified in companion animals in the United States, presenting a unique opportunity to leverage this animal model to investigate the impact of naturally-acquired parasite infections on the microbiome. Clinical, parasitological, and microbiome profiling of a cohort of 258 dogs revealed a significant correlation between parasite infection and composition of the bacterial community in the gut. Relative to other enteric pathogens, Giardia was associated with a more pronounced perturbation of the microbiome. Using a database mining approach that allowed us to compare our findings to a large-scale epidemiological study of enteric diseases in humans, we also observed a substantial alteration to microbiome structure in Giardia-infected children. Importantly, infection was associated with a reduction in the relative abundance of potential pathobionts, including Gammaproteobacteria, and an increase in Prevotella - a profile often associated with gut health. Taken together, our data show that widespread Giardia infection in young animals and humans is associated with significant remodeling of the gut microbiome, and provide a possible explanation for the high prevalence of asymptomatic Giardia infections observed across host species.

ImportanceWhile enteric parasitic infections are among the most important infections in lower- and middle-income countries, their impact on gut microbiota is poorly understood. We reasoned that clinical symptoms associated with these infections may be influenced by alterations of the microbiome that occur during infection. To explore this notion, we took a two-pronged approach. First, we studied a cohort of dogs naturally infected with various enteric parasites and found a strong association between parasite infection and altered gut microbiota composition. Giardia, one of the most prevalent parasite infections globally, had a particularly large impact on the microbiome. Second, we took a database-driven strategy to integrate microbiome data with clinical data from large human field studies and found that Giardia infection is also associated with marked alteration of the gut microbiome of children, suggesting a possible explanation for why Giardia has been reported to be associated with protection from moderate-to-severe diarrhea.","NA"

Splicing reporter studies have shown that decoy splice sites are essential for activity, suggesting that decoys act by engaging intron-terminal splice sites and competing with cross-intron interactions required for intron excision. The decoy model predicts that antisense oligonucleotides blocking decoy splice sites in endogenous pre-mRNA should increase productive gene expression by reducing IR. Indeed, we now demonstrate that targeting a decoy 5' splice site in the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) gene reduced IR from [~]80% to [~]20% in primary human erythroblasts, accompanied by increases in spliced OGT RNA and OGT protein expression. The remaining OGT IR was refractory to antisense treatment and might be mediated by independent mechanism(s). In contrast, other retained introns were strongly dependent on decoy function, since IR was nearly eliminated by antisense targeting of 5' splice sites. Genes in the latter group encode the widely expressed splicing factor (SF3B1), and the erythroid-specific structural protein, alpha-spectrin (SPTA1). These results show that modulating decoy exon function can dramatically alter IR, and suggest that dynamic regulation of decoy exons could be a mechanism to fine tune gene expression post-transcriptionally in many cell types.","10.1261/rna.075028.120"

Unfortunately, this regimen is costly due to the expense of producing recombinant FVIII as a consequence of its low level secretion. FVIII expression activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, causes oxidative stress and induces apoptosis. Importantly, little is known about the factors that cause protein misfolding and aggregation in metazoans. Here we identified intrinsic and extrinsic factors that cause FVIII to form aggregates in the ER. We show that FVIII forms amyloid-like fibrils within the ER upon increased FVIII synthesis or inhibition of glucose metabolism. Significantly, FVIII amyloids can be dissolved upon restoration of glucose metabolism to produce functional secreted FVIII. Two ER chaperones and their co-chaperones, BiP and CANX/CRT, promote FVIII solubility in the ER, where the former is also required for disaggregation. A short aggregation motif in the FVIII A1 domain (termed Aggron) is necessary and sufficient to seed {beta}-sheet polymerization and BiP binding to this Aggron prevents amyloidogenesis.

Previous work has shown that Notch can induce transcriptional responses by binding to promoters, but more often by binding to enhancers, with HES4 and DTX1 as representative mammalian examples of promoter and enhancer responsiveness, respectively. Here, we show that mastermind dependence of the Notch response at these loci is differentially encoded in Jurkat T-ALL cells. Knockout of Mastermind-like1 (MAML1) eliminates Notch responsive activation of both these genes, and reduced target gene expression is accompanied by a decrease in H3K27 acetylation, consistent with the importance of MAML1 for p300 activity. Add-back of defined MAML1 constructs in knockout cells identifies residues 151-350 of MAML1 as essential for expression of either Notch-responsive gene. Fusion of the Notch-binding region of MAML1 to the HAT domain of p300 rescues expression of HES4 but not DTX1, suggesting that an additional activity of MAML1 is needed for gene induction at a distance. Together, these studies establish the functional importance of the MAML1151-350 region for Notch-dependent transcriptional induction, and reveal differential requirements for MAML1-dependent recruitment activities at different Notch responsive loci, highlighting the molecular complexity of NTC-stimulated transcription.","NA"

Separate tests of color memory showed that high similarity triggered a repulsion of long-term memories, wherein remembered colors were biased away from colors of competing objects. This repulsion effect was replicated across three experiments. In a fourth experiment, the repulsion effect was fully eliminated when task demands promoted integration, instead of discrimination, of similar memories. Finally, we show that repulsion of color memory was highly adaptive: greater repulsion was associated with less memory interference. These findings reveal that similarity between events triggers adaptive distortions in how events are remembered.

Using chemogenetics in rat auditory cortex during an adaptive sound disrimination task, here we show that PV+ cells exert bidirectional control over the rate of perceptual learning. Down-regulation of PV+ cell activity accelerated learning, but increasing their activity resulted in slower learning. However, both interventions led to reduced gains in perceptual acuity by the end of training relative to controls. Furthermore, longitudinal training performance was functionally correlated with measures of neural synchrony and stimulus-specific adaptation.

However, the biochemical mechanisms by which metabolic kinases are regulated under oxidative stress is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity of a conserved family of Fructosamine-3-kinases (FN3Ks), which are evolutionarily related to eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs), are regulated by redox active cysteines in the kinase domain. By solving the crystal structure of FN3K homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtFN3K), we demonstrate that it forms an unexpected strand-exchange dimer in which the ATP binding P-loop and adjoining beta strands are swapped between two chains in the dimer. This dimeric configuration is characterized by strained inter-chain disulfide bonds that stabilize the P-loop in an extended conformation and tethers the substrate-binding lobes in a unique inactive conformation. Mutational analysis and solution studies confirm that the strained disulfides function as redox ""switches"" to reversibly regulate FN3K activity and dimerization. Consistently, we find that human FN3K, which contains an equivalent P-loop Cys, is also redox sensitive, whereas ancestral bacterial FN3K homologs, which lack a P-loop Cys, are not. Furthermore, CRISPR knockout of FN3K in human HepG2 cells results in significant upregulation of redox metabolites including glutathione. We propose that redox regulation evolved progressively in FN3Ks in response to changing cellular redox conditions. Our studies provide important new insights into the origin and evolution of redox regulation in the protein kinase superfamily and open new avenues for targeting human FN3K in diabetic complications.

Several gene regions have been previously identified as candidates of adaptive introgression (AI) that facilitated human adaptation to specific environments. However, simulation-based studies have suggested that population genetics processes other than adaptive mutations, such as heterosis from recessive deleterious variants private to populations before admixture, can also lead to patterns in genomic data that resemble adaptive introgression. The extent to which the presence of deleterious variants affect the false-positive rate and the power of current methods to detect AI has not been fully assessed. Here, we used extensive simulations to show that recessive deleterious mutations can increase the false positive rates of tests for AI compared to models without deleterious variants. We further examined candidates of AI in modern humans identified from previous studies and show that, although deleterious variants may hinder the performance of AI detection in modern humans, most signals remained robust when deleterious variants are included in the null model. While deleterious variants may have a limited impact on detecting signals of adaptive introgression in humans, we found that at least two AI candidate genes, HYAL2 and HLA, are particularly susceptible to high false positive rates due to the recessive deleterious mutations. By quantifying parameters that affect heterosis, we show that the high false positives are largely attributed to the high exon densities together with low recombination rates in the genomic regions, which can further be exaggerated by the population growth in recent human evolution. Although the combination of such parameters is rare in the human genome, caution is still warranted in other species with different genomic composition and demographic histories.","NA"

Observations of antibiotic-induced cell morphology changes can rapidly and accurately differentiate drug susceptible from resistant bacterial strains; however, resistant cells do not always remain unchanged. Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative, biothreat pathogen and the causative agent of melioidosis, an often fatal infectious disease for humans.

ResultsHere, we identified {beta}-lactam targets in B. pseudomallei by in silico analysis. Ten genes encoding putative PBPs, including PBP-1, PBP-2, PBP-3 and PBP-6, were detected in the genomes of susceptible and resistant strains. Real-time, live-cell imaging of B. pseudomallei strains demonstrated dynamic morphological changes in broth containing clinically relevant {beta}-lactam antibiotics. At sub-inhibitory concentrations of ceftazidime (CAZ), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC), and imipenem (IPM), filamentation, varying in length and proportion, was an initial response of the multidrug-resistant strain Bp1651 in exponential phase. However, a dominant morphotype reemerged during stationary phase that resembled cells unexposed to antibiotics. Similar morphology dynamics were observed for AMC-resistant strains, MSHR1655 and 724644, when exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of AMC. For all B. pseudomallei strains evaluated, increased exposure time and exposure to increased concentrations of AMC at and above minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in broth resulted in cell morphology shifts from filaments to spheroplasts and/or cell lysis. B. pseudomallei morphology changes were more consistent in IPM. Spheroplast formation followed by cell lysis was observed for all strains in broth containing IPM at concentrations greater than or equal to MICs, however, the time to cell lysis was variable. Length of B. pseudomallei cells was strain-, drug- and drug concentration-dependent.

ConclusionsBoth resistant and susceptible B. pseudomallei strains exhibited filamentation during early exposure to AMC and CAZ at concentrations used to interpret susceptibility (based on CLSI guidelines). While developing a rapid {beta}-lactam antimicrobial susceptibility test based on cell-shape alone requires more extensive analyses, optical microscopy detected B. pseudomallei growth attributes that lend insight into antibiotic response and antibacterial mechanisms of action.","NA"

In this study, quantitative multiplicative and minimising models previously used to study nutrient limitation were applied to the growth of the hydrothermal vent-dwelling organism Halomonas hydrothermalis when subjected to combined nutrient limitation and NaCl-salt stress. Results showed an interactive effect from both salt and nutrient stresses under optimal conditions. However, the fit became more non-interactive as salinity is increased; at which point NaCl-salt had a more dominating effect on growth than inorganic phosphate (Pi). We discuss biochemical hypotheses to explain these data. This work shows that models developed to understand nutrient limitation can be used to quantify and separate the contributions of stresses under other physical and chemical extremes, such as extreme salinity, and facilitate the development of biochemical hypotheses of how extremes may be influencing cell physiology.

ImportanceVery few environments in the natural world are exposed to just one extreme or stress at a time. To understand lifes ability to survive in multiple-extreme environments, we must be able to quantify how different extremes interact. Using methods developed for the study of multiple nutrient limitation, this study uses kinetic growth models to investigate at the effect of extreme environments on bacterial growth. Results show that closer to the extremes of life, individual stresses dominate growth; whereas under optimal conditions there is a multiplicative effect from both salt and nutrient stresses. This approach offers a new way to quantify and potentially understand and develop hypotheses for how life operates under multiple extremes.","NA"

We found that AvrA regulates the conversion of LC3 I into LC3 II and the enrichment of lysosomes. Beclin-1, a key molecular regulator of autophagy, was decreased after AvrA expressed strain colonization. In S.E-AvrA--infected cells, we found the increases of protein levels of p-JNK and p-c-Jun and the transcription level of AP-1. AvrA-reduction of Beclin-1 protein expression is through the JNK pathway. The JNK inhibitor abolished the AvrA-reduced Beclin-1 protein expression. Moreover, we identified that the AvrA mutation C186A abolished its regulation of Beclin-1 expression. In addition, AvrA protein interacted with Beclin-1.

The unusual gating properties of HACCs in plants, i.e., activation by membrane hyperpolarization rather than depolarization, dictates that HACCs are normally open at physiological hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials (the so called pump or P-state), thus, if not regulated, they would be continuously leaking Ca2+ into cells. In guard cells, HACCs are permeable to Ca2+, Ba2+ and Mg2+, activated by H2O2 and the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and their activity is greatly reduced by low amounts of free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]Cyt) and hence will close during [Ca2+]Cyt surges. Here we demonstrate that the presence of the commonly used Mg-ATP inside the cell greatly reduces HACC activity especially at voltages [&le;] -200 mV and that Mg2+ causes this block. We therefore conclude, firstly, that physiological cytosolic Mg2+ levels affect HACCs gating and that channel opening requires either high negative voltages ([&ge;] -200 mV) and/or displacement of Mg2+ away from the immediate vicinity of the channel. Secondly, based on structural comparisons with Mg2+-sensitive animal inward-rectifying K+ channel, we propose that the likely candidate HACCS described here are cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGCs), many of which also contain a conserved di-acidic Mg2+-binding motif within their pores.

Domains that facilitate the oligomerization process are diverse and widespread in nature across all kingdoms of life. One such domain is the Phox and Bem1 (PB1) domain, which is functionally (relatively) well understood in the animal kingdom. However, beyond animals, neither the origin nor the evolutionary patterns of PB1-containing proteins are understood. While PB1 domain proteins have been found in other kingdoms, including plants, it is unclear how these relate to animal PB1 proteins.

To address this question, we utilized large transcriptome datasets along with the proteomes of a broad range of species. We discovered eight PB1 domain-containing protein families in plants, along with three each in Protozoa and Chromista and four families in Fungi. Studying the deep evolutionary history of PB1 domains throughout eukaryotes revealed the presence of at least two, but likely three, ancestral PB1 copies in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA). These three ancestral copies gave rise to multiple orthologues later in evolution. Tertiary structural models of these plant PB1 families, combined with Random Forest based classification, indicated family-specific differences attributed to the length of PB1 domain and the proportion of {beta}-sheets.

This study identifies novel PB1 families and reveals considerable complexity in the protein oligomerization potential at the origin of eukaryotes.

Many researchers apply the existing methods without considering the topology of pathways or at least they have overlooked a significant part of the structure, which may reduce the accuracy and generalizability of the results. Developing a new approach while considering gene expression data and topological features like causal relations regarding edge directions will help the investigators to achieve more accurate results.

ResultsWe proposed a new pathway enrichment analysis based on Bayesian network (BNrich) as an approach in PEA. To this end, the cycles were eliminated in 187 KEGG human signaling pathways concerning intuitive biological rules and the Bayesian network structures were constructed. The constructed networks were simplified by the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selector Operator (LASSO), and their parameters were estimated using the gene expression data. We finally prioritize the impacted pathways by Fishers Exact Test on significant parameters. Our method integrates both edge and node related parameters to enrich modules in the affected signaling pathway network. In order to evaluate the proposed method, consistency, discrimination, false positive rate and empirical P-value criteria were calculated, and the results are compared to well-known enrichment methods such as signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA), bi-level meta-analysis (BLMA) and topology-based pathway enrichment analysis (TPEA).

Even with recent advancements in sequencing technologies, many genome assemblies are still not achieving reference-grade. Here, we introduce ntJoin, a tool that leverages structural synteny between a draft assembly and reference sequence(s) to contiguate and correct the former with respect to the latter. Instead of alignments, ntJoin uses a lightweight mapping approach based on a graph data structure generated from ordered minimizer sketches. The tool can be used in a variety of different applications, including improving a draft assembly with a reference-grade genome, a short read assembly with a draft long read assembly, and a draft assembly with an assembly from a closely-related species. When scaffolding a human short read assembly using the reference human genome or a long read assembly, ntJoin improves the NGA50 length 23- and 13-fold, respectively, in under 13 m, using less than 11 GB of RAM. Compared to existing reference-guided assemblers, ntJoin generates highly contiguous assemblies faster and using less memory.

Here we identify WHIMP (WAVE Homology In Membrane Protrusions) as a new member of the WASP family. The Whimp gene is encoded on the X-chromosome of multiple animals, including mice. Murine WHIMP promotes Arp2/3-dependent actin assembly, but is less potent than other nucleation factors. Nevertheless, WHIMP-mediated Arp2/3 activation enhances both plasma membrane ruffling and wound healing migration, whereas WHIMP depletion impairs protrusion and slows motility. WHIMP expression also increases Src-family kinase activity, and WHIMP-induced ruffles contain the additional nucleation factors WAVE1, WAVE2, and N-WASP, but not JMY or WASH. Perturbing the function of Src-family kinases, WAVE proteins, or Arp2/3 complex inhibits WHIMP-driven ruffling. These results suggest that WHIMP-mediated actin assembly plays a direct role in membrane protrusion, but also results in feedback control of tyrosine kinase signaling to modulate the activation of multiple WASP-family proteins.

AUTHOR SUMMARYThe actin cytoskeleton is a collection of protein polymers that assemble and disassemble within cells at specific times and locations. Sophisticated cytoskeletal regulators called nucleation factors ensure that actin polymerizes when and where it is needed, and most nucleation factors are members of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) family. Several of the 8 known WASP-family proteins function in cell motility, but how the different factors collaborate with one another is not well understood. In this study, we identified WHIMP, a new WASP-family member which is encoded on the X chromosome of a variety of animals. In mouse cells, WHIMP enhances cell motility by assembling actin filaments that push the cell membrane forward. Unexpectedly, WHIMP also activates tyrosine kinase enzymes, proteins that stimulate multiple WASP-family members during motility. Our results open new avenues of research into how nucleation factors cooperate during movement and how the molecular activities that underlie motility differ in distinct cell types and organisms.","10.1371/journal.pgen.1008694"

Understanding the success and unfolding of such biological invasions is thus of high priority. Both local properties and the spatial network structure have been shown to be determinants of invasion success, and the identification of spatial invasion hubs directly promoting invasion dynamics is gaining attention. Spatial dynamics, however, could also indirectly alter invasion success by shaping local community structure: in many ecosystems, such as riverine networks, regional properties such as patch size distribution are known drivers of local community structures, which themselves may affect the establishment success of invading species. Using microcosm experiments in dendritic networks, we disentangled how patch size distribution and dispersal along specific network topologies shaped local communities, and, subsequently, affected the establishment success of invading species. We find that inherent patch size distributions shaped composition and diversity of local communities, and, subsequently, modulated invasion success. Specifically, the relationship between local diversity and invasion success changed across an increasing patch size gradient from a negative to a positive correlation, while overall increasing patch size reduced invasion success. Connectivity did not have a direct effect on invasion success but indirectly affected invasions by shaping diversity patterns in the whole network. Our results emphasize the relevance of indirect, landscape-level effects on species invasions, which need to be considered in the management of spatial habitat networks.","NA"

However, the metabolic response fueling the molecular mechanisms underlying changes in innate immune cell homeostasis remain undefined. Thus, we compared the metabolic response of dendritic cells to that of those infected with active and inactive influenza A virus or treated with toll like receptor agonists. While influenza infects dendritic cells, it does not productively replicate in these cells, and therefore metabolic changes upon infection may represent an adaptive response on the part of the host cells. Using quantitative mass spectrometry along with pulse chase substrate utilization assays and metabolic flux measurements, we found global metabolic changes 17 hours post infection, including significant changes in carbon commitment via glycolysis and glutaminolysis, as well as ATP production via TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Influenza infection of dendritic cells led to a metabolic phenotype, distinct from that induced by TLR agonists, with significant resilience in terms of metabolic plasticity. We identified Myc as one transcription factor modulating this response. Restriction of either Myc activity or mitochondrial substrates resulted in significant changes in the innate immune functions of dendritic cells, including reduced motility and T cell activation. Transcriptome analysis of inflammatory dendritic cells isolated following influenza infection showed similar metabolic reprogramming occurs in vivo. Thus, early in the infection process dendritic cells respond with global metabolic restructuring that is present in lung DC 9 days following infection and impacts their effector function, suggesting that metabolic switching in dendritic cells plays a vital role in initiating the immune response to influenza infection.

Author SummaryIn response to influenza infection we found that dendritic cells, cells that are critical in mounting an effective immune response, undergo a profound metabolic shift. They alter the concentration and location of hundreds of proteins, including c-MYC, mediating a shift to a highly glycolytic phenotype that is also flexible in terms of fueling respiration. Dendritic cells initiate the immune response to influenza and activate the adaptive response allowing viral clearance and manifesting immune memory for protection against subsequent infections. We found that limiting access to specific metabolic pathways or substrates diminished key immune functions. Previously we described an immediate, fixed, hypermetabolic state in infected respiratory epithelial cells. We now show the metabolic responses of epithelial and dendritic cells are distinct. Here, we also demonstrate that dendritic cells tailor their metabolic response to the pathogen or TLR stimulus. This metabolic reprogramming occurs rapidly in vitro and it is sustained in inflammatory dendritic cells in vivo for at least 9 days following influenza infection. Thus, drugs targeting metabolism are likely to have cell- and pathogen-specific activities in the context of infection. These studies open the possibility of modulating the immune response to viral infection via customizing metabolic therapy to enhance or diminish the function of specific cells.","NA"

We show for the first time that a natural colonizer, Streptococcus pneumoniae, also induces specific histone modifications, including robust dephosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10, during infection of respiratory epithelial cells. Two bacterial factors are important for the induction of this modification: the bacterial toxin PLY, a pore-forming toxin, and the pyruvate oxidase SpxB, an enzyme responsible for H2O2 production. The combined effects of PLY and H2O2 lead to host signaling which culminates in H3S10 dephosphorylation, mediated by the host cell phosphatase PP1. Strikingly, S. pneumoniae infection induces dephosphorylation and associated activation of PP1 catalytic activity. Colonization of cells, which lacked active PP1, resulted in the impairment of intracellular S. pneumoniae survival. Interestingly, PP1 activation mediating H3S10 dephosphorylation is not restricted to S. pneumoniae and appears to be a general epigenomic mechanism favoring intracellular survival.","10.1016/j.celrep.2020.02.116"

To investigate this, 38 healthy normal-weight participants (28F, 10M) performed a detection task varying in attentional load (high or low distraction) during fMRI. Simultaneously, they exerted effort for food rewards (sweet or savory) by repeated button presses. Two fMRI runs were separated by outcome devaluation (satiation) of one of the reward outcomes, to assess outcome-sensitive, i.e. goal-directed, responses. Behavioral results showed no effect of distraction on effort for food reward following outcome devaluation. At an uncorrected threshold (p<0.001), distraction decreased goal-directed responses (devalued versus valued) in the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Importantly, these distraction-sensitive rIFG responses correlated negatively (r = - 0.40, p = 0.014) with the effect of distraction on the number of button presses. Specifically, decreased rIFG responses due to distraction related to increased button presses for food reward after satiation, in line with the rIFGs established role in response inhibition. Furthermore, distraction decreased functional connectivity between the rIFG (seed) and left putamen for valued versus devalued food rewards (pFWE(cluster)<0.05). Our results suggest that distraction attenuates the ability to inhibit responses for food reward after satiation by affecting the rIFG. Furthermore, distraction attenuated connectivity between two regions involved in response inhibition - rIFG and putamen - after outcome devaluation.

In this study, we constructed a four-phase flux balance model of guard cell metabolism to investigate the changes in guard cell metabolism over the diel cycle, including the day and night and stomata opening and closing. Our model demonstrated the metabolic flexibility in guard cells, showing that multiple metabolic processes can contribute to the synthesis and metabolism of malate and sucrose as osmolytes during stomatal opening and closing. We showed that guard cells can adapt to varying light availability and sucrose uptake from the apoplast during the day by operating in a mixotrophic mode with a switch between sucrose synthesis via the Calvin-Benson cycle and sucrose degradation via the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. During stomatal opening, our model predicted an alternative flux mode of the Calvin-Benson cycle with all dephosphorylating steps diverted to diphosphate--fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase to produce PPi, which is used to pump protons across the tonoplast for the accumulation of osmolytes. An analysis of the energetics of the use of different osmolytes in guard cells showed that malate and Cl- are similarly efficient as the counterion of K+ during stomatal opening.

Significance statementThis work presents the first four-phase metabolic model for predicting guard cell metabolism over the diel cycle, which predicted an alternative flux model of the Calvin-Benson cycle that maximises the production of PPi during stomatal opening. While multiple metabolic processes were shown be important in synthesising and metabolising osmolytes in guard cells of different experimental systems, our model demonstrated that these processes can operate simultaneously and at different rates depending on conditions.","NA"

At the core of this malignancy are rare, highly heterogenous malignant stem-like tumor initiating cells. Aberrant signaling across the EGFR-PTEN-AKT-mTOR signal transduction pathways are common oncogenic drivers in these cells. Though gene-level clustering has determined the importance of the EGFR signaling pathway as a treatment indicator, multiparameter protein-level analyses are necessary to discern functional attributes of signal propagation. Multiparameter single cell analyses is emerging as particularly useful in identifying such attributes.

MethodsSingle cell targeted proteomic analysis of EGFR-PTEN-AKT-mTOR proteins profiled heterogeneity in a panel of fifteen patient derived gliomaspheres. A microfluidic cell array  chip tool served as a low cost methodology to derive high quality quantitative single cell analytical outputs. Chip design specifications produced extremely high signal-to-noise ratios and brought experimental efficiencies of cell control and minimal cell use to accommodate experimentation with these rare and often slow-growing cell populations. Quantitative imaging software generated datasets to observe similarities and differences within and between cells and patients. Bioinformatic self-organizing maps (SOMs) and hierarchical clustering stratified patients into malignancy and responder groups which were validated by phenotypic and statistical analyses.

ResultsFifteen patient dissociated gliomaspheres produced 59,464 data points from 14,866 cells. Forty-nine molecularly defined signaling phenotypes were identified across samples. Bioinformatics resolved two clusters diverging on EGFR expression (p = 0.0003) and AKT/TORC1 activation (p = 0.08 and p = 0.09 respectively). TCGA status of a subset showed genetic heterogeneity with proneural, classical and mesenchymal subtypes represented in both clusters. Phenotypic validation measures indicated drug responsive phenotypes to EGFR blocking were found in the EGFR expressing cluster. EGFR expression in the subset of drug-treated lines was statistically significant (p<.05). The EGFR expressing cluster was of lower tumor initiating potential in comparison to the AKT/TORC1 activated cluster. Though not statistically significant, EGFR expression trended with improved patient prognosis while AKT/TORC1 activated samples trended with poorer outcomes.

ConclusionsQuantitative single cell heterogeneity profiling resolves signaling diversity into meaningful non-obvious phenotypic groups suggesting EGFR is decoupled from AKT/TORC1 signalling while identifying potentially valuable targets for personalized therapeutic approaches for deadly tumor-initiating cell populations.","NA"

Microbial community from fecal samples of 10 different types of animals and 1 human sample were used to generate a fecal library for community-based microbial source tracking. Orthophosphate and total dissolved solids were among the major factors associated with community composition. SourceTracker analysis of the monthly samples from the Love Creek watershed indicated the majority of the microbial community were attributed to ""unknown"" sources, i.e. wildlife. Those that attribute to known sources were primarily domestic animals, i.e. cat and dog. These results suggest that at the state level these methods are capable of giving the start for source tracking as a means to understanding bacterial contamination.","NA"

This unveiled four hierarchical scales of subcortical organization, recapitulating well-known anatomical nuclei at the coarsest scale and delineating 27 new bilateral regions at the finest. Ultra-high field strength fMRI corroborated and extended this hierarchy, enabling delineation of finer subdivisions of hippocampus and amygdala, while task-evoked fMRI revealed a subtle reorganization of subcortical topography in response to changing cognitive demands.

The tonoplast sucrose transporter PtaSUT4 is well expressed in leaves of P. tremula x P. alba (INRA 717-IB4), and its inhibition by RNA-interference (RNAi) is known to affect leaf sucrose abundance. After partial defoliation, maximum photosynthesis rates increased while intercellular CO2 decreased with trajectories that were similar in wild type and SUT4-RNAi lines. Leaf transpiration increased more robustly in wild-type than RNAi plants, while leaf water content increased more in RNAi lines. Stomatal conductance did not differ between genotypes, nor did it increase with defoliation. Post-defoliation reductions in steady-state levels of sucrose, the major hexoses (glucose and fructose) and starch were similar in wild-type and SUT4-RNAi shoot sinks. Water uptake and stem growth after partial defoliation were not as well sustained in RNAi as in wild-type plants. The data suggest that vacuolar efflux of sucrose by PtaSUT4 more clearly facilitated adjustments in water uptake than sucrose export following leaf removal.","NA"

How Tenms bind to Lphns in a manner regulated by alternative splicing remains unclear. Here, we report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the Tenm2-Lphn3 complex, and describe the trimeric Tenm2-Lphn3-FLRT3 complex. The structure reveals that the N-terminal lectin-like domain of Lphn3 binds to the Tenm2 barrel at a site far away from the alternatively-spliced region. Alternative-splicing regulates the Tenm2-Lphn3 interaction by hindering access to the Lphn-binding surface rather than altering it. Strikingly, mutagenesis of the Lphn-binding surface of Tenm2 abolishes the Lphn3 interaction and impairs excitatory but not inhibitory synapse formation. These results suggest that a multi-level coincident binding mechanism mediated by a cryptic adhesion complex between Tenms and Lphns regulates synapse specificity.","NA"

PATZ1 targets the Cd8 gene in lymphocyte development and interacts with the p53 protein to control genes important in proliferation and DNA damage response. PATZ1 exerts its activity through an N-terminal BTB domain that mediates dimerization and co-repressor interactions and a C-terminal zinc finger motif-containing domain that mediates DNA binding. Here, the crystal structures of the murine and zebrafish PATZ1 BTB domains are reported at 2.3 and 1.8 [A] resolution respectively. The structures reveal that, like other ZBTB structures, the PATZ1 BTB domain forms a stable homodimer and likely binds co-repressors through a lateral surface groove that is formed upon dimerization. Analysis of the lateral groove reveals a large acidic patch in this region which contrasts previously resolved basic co-repressor binding interfaces in other ZBTB proteins. A large 30 amino acids glycine- and alanine-rich central loop, unique to mammalian PATZ1 amongst all ZBTB proteins, could not be resolved likely due to its flexibility. Modelling of this loop indicates that it can participate in the dimerization interface of BTB monomers.

IRE1 is a major transducer that conveys endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to biochemical signals, yet major gaps persist in our understanding of how the detection of stress is converted to one of several molecular outcomes. It is known that upon sensing unfolded proteins via its ER luminal domain, IRE1 dimerizes and oligomerizes (often visualized as clustering), and then trans-autophosphorylates. The IRE1 kinase activity is required for activation of its RNase effector domain and for clustering of IRE1. It is not yet clear if IRE1 clustering is a platform for the RNase activity, or if the two represent distinct biological functions. Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized role for helix K between IRE1 kinase and RNase domains in conveying critical conformational changes. Using mutants within this inter-domain helix, we show for the first time that: 1) distinct substitutions (specifically, of Leu827) selectively affect oligomerization, RNase activity, and, unexpectedly, the kinase activity of IRE1; 2) RNase activation can be uncoupled from IRE1 oligomerization, and phosphorylation of S729 marks the former but not the latter; 3) The nature of residue 827 determines the conformation that the IRE1 protein adopts, leading to different patterns of biochemical activities.

To streamline this process, we present hypercluster, a python package and SnakeMake pipeline for flexible and parallelized clustering evaluation and selection.

Author summaryUnsupervised clustering is a technique for grouping similar samples within a dataset. It is extremely common when analyzing big data from patient samples, or high throughput techniques like single cell RNA-seq. When researchers use unsupervised clustering, they have to select parameters that affect the final result--for instance, how many groups they expect to find or what the smallest group is allowed to be. Some methods require setting even less intuitive parameters. For most applications, it is extremely challenging to guess what the values of these parameters should be; therefore to prevent introducing bias into the final results, researchers should test many different parameters and methods to find the best groups. This process is cumbersome, slow and challenging to perform in a reproducible way. We developed hypercluster, a tool that automates this process, make it much faster, and presenting the results in a reproducible and helpful manner.","NA"

Here, we experimentally manipulated host plant age in two milkweed species (Asclepias fascicularis and Asclepias speciosa) in order to investigate the role of plant species-specific and plant age-varying traits on the survival and growth of monarch caterpillars (Danaus plexippus). We show that the two plant species showed diverging trajectories of defense traits with increasing age. These species-specific and age-varying host plant traits significantly affected the growth and survival of monarch caterpillars through both resource quality- and resource quantity-based constraints. The effects of plant age on monarch developmental success were comparable to and sometimes larger than those of plant species identity. We conclude that species-specific and age-varying plant traits are likely to be important factors with the potential to structure seasonal windows of opportunity for monarch development, and examine the implications of these findings for both broader patterns in the ontogeny of plant defense traits and the specific ecology of milkweed-monarch interactions in a changing world.","10.1002/ecy.3029"

In this study, the development of the intraspinal microstimulation array technology was continued and evaluated in the feline animal model for its ability to provide more focused and reliable bladder control after a complete spinal cord transection. For the first time, the intraspinal multisite silicon array wad built using novel microfabrication processes to provide custom-designed tip geometry and 3D electrode distribution, better cost efficiency, reproducibility, scalability, and on-the-probe integration of active electronics.

About one third of the electrode sites in the that area produced micturition-related responses. The effectiveness of stimulation increased starting from one month after spinal cord transection (as evaluated in one animal), likely due to supraspinal disinhibition of the spinal circuitry and/or hypertrophy and hyperexcitability of the spinal bladder afferents.

Here, we hypothesized that ubiquitination might play a key gatekeeper role in immune system aging and tumorigenesis in CRC. Therefore, we will systematically study the DNA methylation of ubiquitination genes and screen candidate CRC marker that are correlated with both aging and immune cell compositions.

DesignThrough aging- and immune-related DNA methylation data, we investigated the DNA methylation regulation changes in promoters with other regions of genes during aging and their association with the immune cell proportion in the circulating whole blood of healthy individuals. Then, by collecting a cohort of 100 colon cancer patients and 50 healthy individuals, we used nucleic acid mass spectrometry to test whether ubiquitination genes can be used as candidate markers for the early screening of CRC.

ResultsThe biological analyses for aging- and CD4 T cell proportion-derived differential genes showed that they are associated with ubiquitination. Among them, DZIP3 was significantly associated with both aging (P-value = 3.86E-06) and CD4 T cell proportion (P-value = 1.97E-05) in circulating blood.

However, few studies have investigated detailed visual selectivity of each time-frequency band, especially in the primate inferior temporal cortex (ITC). In this work, we analyze frequency-specific electrocorticography (ECoG) activities in the primate ITC by training encoding models that predict frequency-specific amplitude from hierarchical visual features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network (CNNs). We find that ECoG activities in two specific time-frequency bands, theta (around 5 Hz) and gamma (around 20-25 Hz) bands, are better predicted from CNN features than the other bands. Furthermore, theta- and gamma-band activities are better predicted from higher and lower layers in CNNs, respectively. Our visualization analysis using CNN-based encoding models qualitatively show that theta- and gamma-band encoding models have selectivity to higher- and lower-level visual features, respectively.

ResultsTreatment of glioma cells with the dopamine receptor antagonist quetiapine reduced glioma cell self-renewal in vitro and combined treatment of mice with quetiapine and radiation prolonged the survival of glioma-bearing animals. The combined treatment induced the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis.

Nicolás","Universidad de Murcia","2020-01-14",1,"cc_by","new results","genetics","Epimutations in fungal pathogens are emerging as novel phenomena that could explain the fast-developing resistance to antifungal drugs and other stresses. These epimutations are generated by RNA interference (RNAi) mechanisms that transiently silence specific genes to overcome stressful stimuli. The early-diverging fungus Mucor circinelloides exercises a fine control over two interacting RNAi pathways to produce epimutants: the canonical RNAi pathway and a new RNAi degradative pathway. The latter is considered a non-canonical RNAi pathway (NCRIP) because it relies on RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) and a novel ribonuclease III-like named R3B2 to degrade target transcripts. Here in this work, we uncovered the role of NCRIP in regulating virulence processes and transposon movements through key components of the pathway, RdRP1, and R3B2. Mutants in these genes are unable to launch a proper virulence response to macrophage phagocytosis, resulting in a decreased virulence potential. The transcriptomic profile of rdrp1{Delta} and r3b2{Delta} mutants revealed a pre-exposure adaptation to the stressful phagosomal environment even when the strains are not confronted by macrophages. These results suggest that NCRIP represses key targets during regular growth and release its control when the fungus is challenged by a stressful environment. NCRIP interacts with the RNAi canonical core to protect genome stability by controlling the expression of centromeric retrotransposable elements. In the absence of NCRIP, these retrotransposons are robustly repressed by the canonical RNAi machinery; thus, supporting the antagonistic role of NCRIP in containing the epimutational pathway. Both interacting RNAi pathways might be essential to govern host-pathogen interactions through transient adaptations, contributing to the unique traits of the emerging infection mucormycosis.

Author summaryMucormycosis is an emergent and lethal infectious disease caused by Mucorales, a fungal group resistant to most antifungal drugs. Mucor circinelloides, a genetic model to characterize this infection, can develop drug resistance via RNAi epimutations. This epimutational RNAi mechanism interacts with a novel non-canonical RNAi pathway (NCRIP), where the ribonuclease III-like R3B2 and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRP1 are essential. The analysis of the transcriptomic response to phagocytosis by macrophage in rdrp1{Delta} and r3b2{Delta} mutants revealed that NCRIP might control virulence in M. circinelloides. These mutants showed constitutive activation of the response to phagocytosis and a reduction in virulence in a mouse model, probably caused by a disorganized execution of the genetic program to overcome host defense mechanisms. The antagonistic role of the NCRIP and the RNAi canonical core is evident during post-transcriptional regulation of centromeric retrotransposons. These retrotransposons are silenced by the canonical RNAi pathway, but this regulation is restrained by NCRIP, proven by an overproduction of small RNAs targeting these loci in NCRIP mutants. These new insights into the initial phase of mucormycosis and transposable element regulation point to NCRIP as a crucial genetic regulator of pathogenesis-related molecular processes that could serve as pharmacological targets.","NA"

In this study, two sets of RF models were developed for the national and departmental levels in Colombia to predict weekly dengue cases at 12-weeks ahead. A national model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) was also developed and used as a comparator to the RF models. The various predictors included historic dengue cases, satellite-derived estimates for vegetation, precipitation, and air temperature, population counts, income inequality, and education. Our RF model trained on the national data was more accurate for department-specific weekly dengue cases estimation compared to a local model trained only on the departments data. Additionally, the forecast errors of the national RF model were smaller to those of the national ANN model and were increased with the forecast horizon increasing from one-week ahead (mean absolute error, MAE: 5.80; root mean squared error, RMSE: 11.10) to 12-weeks ahead (MAE: 13.38; RMSE: 26.82). There was considerable variation in the relative importance of predictors dependent on forecast horizon. The environmental and meteorological predictors were relatively important for short-term dengue forecast horizons while socio-demographic predictors were relevant for longer-term forecast horizons. This study showed the potential of RF in dengue forecasting with also demonstrating the feasibility of using a national model to forecast at finer spatial scales. Furthermore, sociodemographic predictors are important to include to capture longer-term trends in dengue.

Author summaryDengue virus has the highest disease burden of all mosquito-borne viral diseases, infecting 390 million people annually in 128 countries. Forecasting is an important warning mechanism that can help with proactive planning and response for clinical and public health services. In this study, we compare two different machine learning approaches to dengue forecasting: random forest (RF) and neural networks (NN). National and local (departmental-level) models were compared and used to predict dengue cases in the future. The results showed that the counts of future dengue cases were more accurately estimated by RF than by NN. It was also shown that environmental and meteorological predictors were more important for forecast accuracy for shorter-term forecasts while socio-demographic predictors were more important for longer-term forecasts. Finally, the national model applied to local data was more accurate in dengue forecasting compared to the local model. This research contributes to the field of disease forecasting and highlights different considerations for future forecasting studies.","NA"

In order to study the spatial correlation of single ErbB2 proteins and actin filaments, we applied correlative fluorescence microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to image specifically labeled SKBR3 breast cancer cells. The breast cancer cells were grown on microchips, transformed to express an actin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein, and labeled with quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles attached to specific anti-ErbB2 Affibodies. Fluorescence microscopy was performed to identify cellular regions with spatially correlated actin and ErbB2 expression. For STEM of the intact plasma membrane of whole cells, the cells were fixed and covered with graphene. Spatial distribution patterns of ErbB2 in the actin rich ruffled membrane regions were examined, and compared to adjacent actin-low regions of the same cell, revealing an association of putative signaling active ErbB2 homodimers with actin-rich regions. ErbB2 homodimers were found absent from actin-low membrane regions, as well as after treatment of cells with Cytochalasin D, which breaks up larger actin filaments. In both latter data sets, a significant inter-label distance of 36 nm was identified, possibly indicating an indirect attachment to helical actin filaments via the formation of heterodimers of ErbB2 with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The possible attachment to actin filaments was further explored by identifying linear QD-chains in actin-rich regions, which also showed an inter-label distance of 36 nm.","NA"

The  eternal embryo hydra can completely regenerate from a disorganised cell cluster or a small fragment of tissue of about 10,000 cells. During regeneration, the cells first form a hollow cell spheroid, which then undergoes de-novo symmetry breaking to irreversibly polarise. Here, we address the symmetry-related shape changes. Prior to axis establishment, the spherical aggregates of regenerating cells show highly coordinated mechanical oscillations on several timescales that are isotropic in space. There are transient periods of fluctuations in defined arbitrary directions, until these undergo a clearly identified irreversible transition to directed fluctuations along the future main axis of the regenerating hydra. Stabilised cytosolic actin structures disappear during the de-novo polarisation, while polymerised microtubules remain. Drugs that depolymerise actin filaments accelerate the symmetry breaking process, while drug-stabilised actin filaments prevent it. Nocodazole-depolymerised microtubules prevent symmetry breaking, but it can be rescued by the microtubule-stabilising drug paclitaxel at concentrations where microtubular structures start to reappear. We discuss the possibility that these mechanical fluctuations induce the orientation of the microtubules, which contribute to {beta}-catenin nuclear translocation, to increase the organiser-forming-potential of the cells. Our data suggest that in regenerating hydra spheroids, the biomechanical shape fluctuations are an integral part of the cooperative polarisation of the self-organising hydra, during which microtubules play a pivotal role.","NA"

Proper functioning of MuSCs, including activation, proliferation, and fate decision, is determined by an orchestrated series of events and communication between MuSCs and their niche consisting of the host myofiber and neighbouring cells. A multitude of biochemical stimuli are known to regulate fate and function of MuSCs. However, in addition to biochemical factors, it is conceivable that MuSCs residing between basal lamina and sarcolemma of myofibers are subjected to mechanical forces during muscle stretch-shortening cycles due to myofascial connections between MuSCs and myofibers. MuSCs have been shown to respond to mechanical forces in vitro but it remains to be proven whether physical forces are also exerted on MuSCs in their native niche and whether they contribute to the functioning and fate of MuSCs.

MethodsMuSCs deformation in their native niche resulting from mechanical loading of ex vivo myofiber bundles were visualized utilizing mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre-reporter mouse and multiphoton microscopy. MuSCs were subjected to 1 hour pulsating fluid shear stress with a peak shear stress rate of 8.8 Pa/s. After treatment, nitric oxide and mRNA expression levels of genes involved in regulation of MuSC proliferation and differentiation were determined.

ResultsEx vivo stretching of extensor digitorum longus and soleus myofiber bundles caused compression as well as tensile and shear deformation of MuSCs in their niche. MuSCs responded to pulsating fluid shear stress in vitro with increased nitric oxide production and an upward trend in iNOS mRNA levels, while nNOS expression was unaltered. Pulsating fluid shear stress enhanced gene expression of c-Fos, Cdk4, and IL-6, while expression of Wnt1, MyoD, Myog, Wnt5a, COX2, Rspo1, Vangl2, Wnt10b, and MGF remained unchanged.

ConclusionsWe conclude that MuSCs in their native niche are subjected to force-induced deformations due to myofiber stretch-shortening. Moreover, MuSCs are mechanoresponsive as evident by pulsating fluid shear stress-mediated expression of factors by MuSCs known to promote proliferation.","NA"

Despite earlier demonstrations of role of cAMP in survival of Leishmania during macrophage infection, there is essential need to specifically clarify involvement of cAMP in various cellular processes in the parasite. In this context, we sought to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effect of cAMPanalogs and cAMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors on proliferation of log phase parasites. Administration of both hydrolysable (8-pCPT-cAMP) and non-hydrolysable analogs (Sp-8-pCPT-cAMPS) of cAMP resulted in significant decrease of Leishmania proliferation. Amongst the various PDE inhibitors, etazolate was found to be potently anti-proliferative. BrdU cell proliferation and K/N/F-enumeration microscopic study revealed that both cAMP analogues and selective PDE inhibitors resulted in significant cell cycle arrest at G1 phase with reduced S-phase population. Furthermore, careful examination of the flagellar motility patterns revealed significantly reduced coordinated forward flagellar movement of the promastigotes with a concomitant decrease in cellular ATP levels. Alongside, 8-pCPT-cAMP and PDE inhibitors etazolate and trequinsin showed marked reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential. Treatment of etazolate at subcytotoxic concentration to infected macrophages significantly reduced parasite burden and administration of etazolate to Leishmania-infected BALB/c mice showed reduced liver and spleen parasite burden. Collectively, these results imply involvement of cAMP in various crucial processes paving the avenue for developing potent anti-leishmanial agent.

Author SummaryLeishmania donovani is the causative agent of fatal Visceral Leishmaniasis. The current available medications are toxic, expensive and require long term daily administrations. With an aim to develop improved therapeutic, components of cAMP homeostasis, particularly cAMP-phosphodiesteares, has been targeted for Leishmania and other kinetoplastid pathogens. cAMP plays diverse roles in functional processes involved in cell division, transition into different stages of the life cycle of Leishmania and motility. In this study, the authors found administration of both hydrolysable and non-hydrolysable analogs of cAMP and certain PDE inhibitors resulted in remarkable decrease proliferation with considerable cytopathic impact on promastigotes. The mammalian phosphodiestearse inhibitor etazolate caused significant reduction in parasite load in L. donovani infected macrophages and demonstrated considerable reduction of liver and spleen parasite burden in in vivo mouse infection model. The study suggested that etazolate, with its slightest impact on mammalian host, can be repurposed for developing effective anti-leishmanials.","NA"

Here we report a novel role for the condensin I subunit Cap-G in Drosophila neurons. We show that, despite not requiring condensin for mitotic chromosome compaction, post-mitotic neurons express Cap-G and that knockdown of Cap-G specifically in neurons (from their birth onwards) results in developmental arrest, behavioural defects, and dramatic gene expression changes. These include reduced expression of a subset of neuronal genes and aberrant expression of genes that are not normally expressed in the developing brain. Knockdown of Cap-G in more mature neurons also results in similar phenotypes but to a lesser degree. Furthermore, we see dynamic binding of Cap-G to chromatin at distinct loci in neural stem cells and differentiated neurons. Therefore, Cap-G is essential for proper gene expression in neurons and plays an important role during the early stages of neuronal development.

Modulation in functional activity of kinases has been attributed to their interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Herein, we have characterized Plasmodium falciparum 14-3-3 and its interaction with key kinase of the parasite, Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase 1 (CDPK1) by performing various analytical biochemistry and biophysical assays. Towards this, we annotated PF3D7_0818200 as 14-3-3 isoform I through extensive phylogenetic and comparative sequence analysis. Molecular dynamics simulation studies indicated that phosphoSer64 present in CDPK1 polypeptide sequence (61KLGpS64) behaves as canonical Mode I-type (RXXpS/pT) consensus 14-3-3 binding motif, mediating the interaction. The protein-protein interaction was validated in vitro with ELISA and SPR, which confirmed that CDPK1 interacts with 14-3-3I in a phosphorylation dependent manner, with binding affinity constant of 670 {+/-} 3.6 nM. The interaction of 14-3-3I with CDPK1 was validated with well characterized optimal 14-3-3 recognition motifs: ARSHpSYPA and RLYHpSLPA as CDPK1 mimetics, by simulation studies and ITC. Further, interaction antagonizing peptidomimetics showed growth inhibitory impact on the parasite indicating crucial physiological role of 14-3-3/CDPK1 interaction. Overall, this study characterizes 14-3-3I as a scaffold protein in the malaria parasite and unveils CDPK1 as its previously unidentified target. This sets a precedent for the rational design of 14-3-3 based PPI inhibitors by utilizing 14-3-3 recognition motif peptides, as a potential antimalarial strategy.","NA"

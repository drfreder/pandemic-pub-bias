We present a tool focusing on structure-based discovery and display of these groups. Since prediction of buried group pKas is computationally intensive, solvent accessibility of ionisable groups is displayed, from which the user can iteratively select pKa calculation centers. Results are color-coded, with emphasis on buried groups. Utility is demonstrated with coronaviruses, which exhibit variable dependence on the acidic pH of the endocytotic pathway. After benchmarking with variants of murine hepatitis virus, a pair of conserved histidine residues are identified that are predicted to be electrostatically frustrated at acidic pH in a common structural core of pre- and post-fusion coronavirus spike proteins. We suggest that an intermediate expanded conformation at endosomal pH could relax the frustration, allowing histidine protonation, and facilitating conformational conversion.

USP18 is the predominant human protease that cleaves interferon-stimulated gene ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein tightly regulated in the context of innate immunity, from its modified substrate proteins in vivo. In this study, using advanced proteomic techniques, we have expanded the USP18-dependent ISGylome and proteome in a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)-derived cell line (HAP1) treated with type I IFN. Novel ISGylation targets were characterised that modulate the sensing of innate ligands, antigen presentation and secretion of cytokines. Consequently, CML USP18-deficient cells are more antigenic, driving increased activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and are more susceptible to irradiation. Our results suggest USP18 as a pharmacological target in cancer immunotherapy and radiotherapy.","NA"

The complex milieu of biophysical cues, cellular components, and cell-secreted factors regulates the process by which HSC produce the blood and immune system. We previously showed direct co-culture of primary murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with a population of marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal and progenitor cells (MSPCs) in a methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel improves hematopoietic progenitor maintenance. However, the mechanism by which MSPCs influenced HSC fate decisions remained unknown. Herein, we report the use of proteomic analysis to correlate HSC phenotype to a broad candidate pool of 200 soluble factors produced by combined mesenchymal and hematopoietic progeny. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), along with an iterative filter method, identified TGF{beta}-1, MMP-3, c-RP, and TROY as positively correlated with HSC maintenance. Experimentally, we then observe exogenous stimulation of HSC monocultures in GelMA hydrogels with these combined cytokines increases the ratio of hematopoietic progenitors to committed progeny after a 7-day culture 7.52 {+/-} 3.65 fold compared to non-stimulated monocultures. Findings suggest a cocktail of the downselected cytokines amplify hematopoietic maintenance potential of HSCs beyond that of MSPC-secreted factors alone. This work integrates empirical and computation methods to identify cytokine combinations to improve HSC maintenance within an engineered HSC niche, suggesting a route towards identifying feeder-free culture platforms for HSC expansion.

InsightHematopoietic stem cells within an artificial niche receive maintenance cues in the form of soluble factors from hematopoietic and mesenchymal progeny. Applying a proteomic regression analysis, we identify a reduced set of soluble factors correlated to maintenance of a hematopoietic phenotype during culture in a biomaterial model of the bone marrow niche. We identify a minimum factor cocktail that promotes hematopoietic maintenance potential in a gelatin-based culture, regardless of the presence of mesenchymal feeder-cells. By combining empirical and computational methods, we report an experimentally feasible number of factors from a large dataset, enabling exogenous integration of soluble factors into an engineered hematopoietic stem cell for enhance maintenance potential of a quiescent stem cell population.","NA"

Recently, network-based methods for the analysis of drug-target interactions have gained attention and relies on the paradigm that a single drug can act on multiple targets rather than a single target. In this study, we have presented a novel approach to analyze the interactions between the chemicals in the medicinal plants and multiple targets based on the complex multipartite network of the medicinal plants, multi-chemicals, and multiple targets. The multipartite network was constructed via the conjunction of two relationships: chemicals in plants and the biological actions of those chemicals on the targets. By analyzing the structural characteristics of the network using the network analysis techniques, we investigated the similarities among the plants via their chemical profiles obtained from the hierarchical clustering analysis. In doing so, we introduced an index of the efficacy of chemicals in a plant on a protein target of interest, called target potency score (TPS). We showed that the analysis can identify specific chemical profiles from each group of plants, which can then be employed for discovering new alternative therapeutic agents. Furthermore, specific clusters of plants and chemicals acting on specific targets were retrieved using TPS that suggested potential drug candidates with high probability of clinical success. We expect that this approach may open a way to predict the biological functions of multi-chemicals and multi-plants on the targets of interest and enable repositioning of the plants and chemicals.","NA"

Here, improper immune regulation can cause inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis. Antibody therapies blocking signaling through the CD40 - CD40L axis showed promising results as these molecules have been described to be deregulated in certain IBD patients. To better understand the mechanism, we used transgenic DC-LMP1/CD40 animals, which lack intestinal CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) and therefore cannot induce regulatory T (iTreg) cells due to a constitutive CD40-signal in CD11c+ cells. These mice rapidly develop spontaneous fatal colitis with an increase of inflammatory IL-17+IFN-{gamma}+ Th17/Th1 and IFN-{gamma}+ Th1 cells. In the present study we analyzed the impact of the microbiota on disease development and detected elevated IgA- and IgG-levels in sera from DC-LMP1/CD40 animals. Their serum antibodies specifically bound intestinal bacteria and we identified a 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL (Hsp60) from Helicobacter hepaticus (Hh) as the main specific antigen targeted in absence of iTregs. When rederived to a different Hh-free SPF-microbiota, mice showed few signs of disease without fatalities, but upon recolonization of mice with Hh we found rapid disease onset and the generation of inflammatory Th17/Th1 and Th1 cells in the colon. Thus, the present work identifies a major bacterial antigen and highlights the impact of specific microorganisms on modulating the host immune response and its role on disease onset, progression and outcome in this colitis model.","NA"

They influence ecosystem functioning through interactions with their hosts. Laboratory studies of phage-host pairs have advanced our understanding of phenotypic and genetic diversification in bacteria and phages. However, the dynamics of phage-host interactions has been seldom recorded in complex natural environments. We conducted an observational metagenomic study of the dynamics of interaction between Gordonia and their phages using a three-year data series of samples collected from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. The aim was to obtain a comprehensive picture of the coevolution dynamics in naturally evolving populations at relatively high time resolution. Co-evolution was followed by monitoring changes over time in the CRISPR loci of Gordonia metagenome-assembled genome, and reciprocal changes in the viral genome. Genome-wide analysis indicated low strain variability of Gordonia, and almost clonal conservation of the trailer-end of the CRISPR loci. Incorporation of newer spacers gave rise to multiple coexisting bacterial populations. A host population containing a CRISPR array variant, which did not contain spacers against the coexisting phages, accounted for more than half of the total host abundance in the majority of samples. Phages genome co-evolved by introducing directional changes, with no preference for mutations within the protospacer and PAM regions. Metagenomic reconstruction of time-resolved variants of host and virus genomes revealed how selection operates at the population level. In activated sludge, it differed from the arms-race observed in nutrient rich media and resembled the fluctuating selection dynamics observed in natural environments.","NA"

Two fundamentally different processes shape the epidemiology of CPE in hospitals: the dissemination of CPE clones from patient to patient (between-patient transfer), and the transfer of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids between enterobacteria in the gut microbiota of individual patients (within-patient transfer). The relative contribution of each process to the overall dissemination of carbapenem resistance in hospitals remains poorly understood. Here, we used mechanistic models combining epidemiological data from more than 9,000 patients with whole genome sequence information from 250 enterobacteria clones to characterise the dissemination routes of the carbapenemase-encoding plasmid pOXA-48 in a hospital setting over a two-year period. Our results revealed frequent between-patient transmission of high-risk pOXA-48-carrying clones, mostly of Klebsiella pneumoniae and sporadically Escherichia coli. The results also identified pOXA-48 dissemination hotspots within the hospital, such as specific wards and individual rooms within wards. Using high-resolution plasmid sequence analysis, we uncovered the pervasive within-patient transfer of pOXA-48, suggesting that horizontal plasmid transfer occurs in the gut of virtually every colonised patient. The complex and multifaceted epidemiological scenario exposed by this study provides new insights for the development of intervention strategies to control the in-hospital spread of CPE.","NA"

Here, we describe the identification and evaluation of commercially available reagents and assays for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in infected formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell pellets. We identified a suitable rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody for cross detection of the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA).

The level of activity affects mood and behaviour, with increased activity in the lateral habenula reflecting exposure to punishment and a switch to passive coping and depression. Here, we identify GABAergic neurons that could reduce activity in the lateral habenula of larval zebrafish. GAD65/67 immunohistochemistry and imaging of gad1b:DsRed transgenic fish suggest the presence of GABAergic terminals in the neuropil and between cell bodies in the lateral habenula. Retrograde tracing with the lipophilic dye DiD suggests that the former derives from the thalamus, while the latter originates from a group of cells in the posterior hypothalamus that are located between the posterior tuberal nucleus and hypothalamic lobes. Two-photon calcium imaging indicates that blue light causes excitation of thalamic GABAergic neurons and terminals in the neuropil, while a subpopulation of lateral habenula neurons show reduced intracellular calcium levels. Whole-cell electrophysiological recording indicates that blue-light reduces membrane potential of lateral habenula neurons. These observations suggest that GABAergic input from the thalamus may mediate inhibition in the zebrafish lateral habenula. Mechanisms governing release of GABA from the neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, which are likely to be in the tuberomammillary nucleus, remain to be defined.","NA"

Substantial evidence supports the prevailing notion that plants possess a two-tiered innate immune system, called pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). PTI is triggered by microbial patterns via cell surface-localized pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), whereas ETI is activated by pathogen effector proteins via mostly intracellularly-localized receptors called nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs)1-4. PTI and ETI have traditionally been considered to act independently and have evolved sequentially5,6. Here we show that, contrary to the perception of PTI and ETI being separate immune signaling pathways, Arabidopsis PRR/co-receptor mutants, fls2/efr/cerk1 and bak1/bkk1/cerk1 triple mutants, are greatly impaired in ETI responses when challenged with incompatible Pseudomonas syrinage bacteria. We further show that the NADPH oxidase (RBOHD)-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a critical early signaling event connecting PRR and NLR cascades and that PRR-mediated phosphorylation of RBOHD is necessary for full activation of RBOHD during ETI. Furthermore, NLR signaling rapidly augments the transcript and protein levels of key PTI components at an early stage and in a salicylic acid-independent manner. Our study supports an alternative model in which PTI is in fact an indispensable component of ETI during bacterial infection, implying that ETI halts pathogen infection, in part, by directly co-opting the anti-pathogen mechanisms proposed for PTI. This alternative model conceptually unites two major immune signaling pathways in the plant kingdom and mechanistically explains the long-observed similarities in downstream defense outputs between PTI and ETI.","NA"

Despite impressive progress, however, the scaling necessary in order to achieve greater computational power has been hampered by many constraints, including repressor toxicity and the lack of large sets of mutually-orthogonal repressors. As a consequence, a typical circuit contains no more than roughly seven repressor-based gates per cell. A possible way around this scalability problem is to distribute the computation among multiple cell types, which communicate among themselves using diffusible small molecules (DSMs) and each of which implements a small sub-circuit. Examples of DSMs are those employed by quorum sensing systems in bacteria. This paper focuses on systematic ways to implement this distributed approach, in the context of the evaluation of arbitrary Boolean functions.

The unique characteristics of genetic circuits and the properties of DSMs require the development of new Boolean synthesis methods, distinct from those classically used in electronic circuit design. In this work, we propose a fast algorithm to synthesize distributed realizations for any Boolean function, under constraints on the number of gates per cell and the number of orthogonal DSMs. The method is based on an exact synthesis algorithm to find the minimal circuit per cell, which in turn allows us to build an extensive database of Boolean functions up to a given number of inputs.

For concreteness, we will specifically focus on circuits of up to 4 inputs, which might represent, for example, two chemical inducers and two light inputs at different frequencies. Our method shows that, with a constraint of no more than seven gates per cell, the use of a single DSM increases the total number of realizable circuits by at least 7.58-fold compared to centralized computation. Moreover, when allowing two DSMs, one can realize 99.995% of all possible 4-input Boolean functions, still with at most 7 gates per cell. The methodology introduced here can be readily adapted to complement recent genetic circuit design automation software.","NA"

The majority of cases are caused by mutations in type I collagen, or by mutations that affect collagen processing and/or modification. Like bone, the extracellular matrix of tendons and ligaments is largely made up of type I collagen; however, despite the fact that a subset of OI patients presents with joint hypermobility, how tendon/ligament dysfunction contributes to this is unknown. Here, we performed a detailed phenotypic characterization of the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendon, Achilles tendon and patellar ligament in the Crtap mutant mouse model of severe, recessive OI. Stable, pyridinoline collagen cross-links were increased by 5- to 10-fold in mutant tendons and ligaments. Collagen fibril size in all three structures was also smaller in Crtap-/- mice compared to wildtype or heterozygous littermates. Together, these ultrastructural and biochemical changes resulted in thinner tendons and ligaments with increased cellularity compared to controls, as assessed by histology. To examine how alterations in tendons might affect motor function, we performed a battery of behavioral assays. During open field assessment, Crtap-/- mice exhibited reduced horizontal and vertical activity. Crtap-/- mice also exhibited motor impairments on the rotarod and grid footslip tests. In addition, Crtap-/- mice had reduced grip strength and displayed reduced time on the inverted grid test, indicating that they are weaker than wildtype and heterozygous mice. In summary, these data demonstrate that the tendons/ligaments of Crtap-/- mice are pathologically altered compared to wildtype - a phenotype that correlates with motor deficits and grip strength impairments. As such, Crtap-/- mice provide a preclinical model with which to examine downstream mechanisms and therapies pertaining to tendon/ligament pathology and motor dysfunction for OI patients.","NA"

TMPRSS2 is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites, Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816. The present study aims to investigate the conformational details of complex between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in order to discern the finer details of the priming of viral spike and to point candidate drug targets. Briefly, full length structural model of TMPRSS2 was developed and docked against the resolved structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites. The docking simulations showed that TMPRSS2 interacts with the two different loops of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, each containing different cleavage sites. Key functional residues of TMPRSS2 (His296, Ser441 and Ser460) were found to interact with immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared to the N-terminal cleavage site (Arg685/Ser686), TMPRSS2 region that interact with C-terminal cleavage site (Arg815/Ser816) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was predicted as relatively more druggable.

Here, we report the first cytoskeletal ""reader"" for this SETD2 methyl mark: the polybromo protein PBRM1. We found PBRM1 directly binds the -Tub-K40me3 mark on tubulin, and localizes to the mitotic spindle and spindle pole during cell division. PBRM1 can assemble a PBAF complex in the absence of chromatin as revealed by mass spectrometry, and can recruit other PBAF complex components including SMARCA4 and ARID2 to -tubulin. In addition to PBRM1, other PBAF components were also localized to the mitotic spindle and spindle pole. This PBAF localization was dependent on recruitment to microtubules by PBRM1, and loss of spindle-associated PBRM1/PBAF led to genomic instability as assessed by increased formation of micronuclei. These data reveal a previously unknown function for PBRM1 beyond its role remodeling chromatin, and expand the repertoire of chromatin remodelers involved in writing and reading methyl marks on the cytoskeleton. The results of this study lay the foundation for a new paradigm for the epigenetic machinery as chromatocytoskeletal modifiers, with coordinated nuclear and cytoskeletal functions.","NA"

Mammalian cilia shed EVs to eliminate unwanted receptors [5] or in the process of cilia retraction when cultured cells enter the cell cycle [6]. Here we used our established C. elegans model to study sensory-evoked ciliary EV release and targeting using a fluorescently labeled EV cargo polycystin-2 (PKD-2). In C. elegans and mammals, the Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) gene products polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 localize to both cilia and EVs, act in the same genetic pathway, and function in a sensory capacity, suggesting ancient conservation. We find that males deposit PKD-2::GFP-carrying EVs onto the vulva of the hermaphrodite during mating. We also show that mechanical stimulation triggers release of PKD-2::GFP-carrying EVs from cilia. To our knowledge this is the first report of mechanoresponsive nature of the ciliary EV release and of ciliary EV directional transfer from one animal to another animal. Since the polycystins are evolutionary conserved ciliary EV cargoes, our findings suggest that similar mechanisms for EV release and targeting may occur in other animals.","NA"

Despite being found diversely in male gametes (e.g. Plasmodium microgametocytes and human and Drosophila sperm), very little is known about cytoplasmic cilia assembly. Here we show that a novel RNP granule containing the mRNAs for axonemal dynein motor proteins becomes highly polarized to the distal end of the cilia during cytoplasmic ciliogenesis in Drosophila sperm. This allows for the localized translation of these axonemal dyneins and their incorporation into the axoneme directly from the cytoplasm. We found that this RNP granule contains the proteins Reptin and Pontin, loss of which perturbs granule formation and prevents incorporation of the axonemal dyneins, leading to sterility. We propose that cytoplasmic cilia require the local translation of key protein constituents such that these proteins are incorporated efficiently into the axoneme.

As part of the response to the 2015-2016 ZIKV outbreak, we recently developed pseudo-infectious ZIKV RVPs by modifying our DENV RVP system. The use of ZIKV RVPs as critical reagents in human clinical trials requires their further validation using stability and reproducibility metrics for large-scale applications. In the current study, we validated ZIKV RVPs using infectivity, neutralization, and enhancement assays with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and human ZIKV-positive patient serum. ZIKV RVPs are antigenically identical to live virus based on binding ELISA and neutralization results and are nonreplicating based on the results of plaque formation assays. We demonstrate reproducible neutralization titer data (NT50 values) across different RVP production lots, volumes, time frames, and laboratories. We also show RVP stability across experimentally relevant time intervals and temperatures. Our results demonstrate that ZIKV RVPs provide a safe, rapid, and reproducible reagent for large-scale, long-term studies of neutralizing antibodies and sera, which can facilitate large-scale screening and epidemiological studies to help expedite ZIKV vaccine development.

We report that in the absence of SG, G3BP1 acts as lysosomal anchor of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) protein complex. By tethering the TSC complex to lysosomes, G3BP1 suppresses signaling through the metabolic master regulator mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1). Like the known TSC complex subunits, G3BP1 suppresses phenotypes related to mTORC1 hyperactivity in the context of tumors and neuronal dysfunction.

Other times, value information may be retrieved directly from a specific prior experience with an option. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, we investigated the neural systems involved in retrieving and assessing information from different memory sources to support value-based choice. Participants completed a task in which items could be conferred positive or negative value based on schematic associations (i.e. schema value), or learned directly from experience via deterministic feedback (i.e. experienced value). We found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity correlated with the influence of both experience- and schema-based values on participants decisions. Connectivity between vmPFC and middle temporal cortex also tracked the inferred value of items based on schematic associations on the first presentation of ingredients, prior to any feedback. In contrast, the striatum responded to participants willingness to bet on ingredients as a function of the unsigned strength of their memory for those options values. These results argue that striatum and vmPFC play distinct roles in memory-based value judgment and decision-making. Specifically, the vmPFC assesses the value of options based on information inferred from schematic knowledge and retrieved from prior direct experience, while the striatum controls a decision to act on options based on memory strength.","NA"

The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of 2019-nCov into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion domains, is essential for the zoonotic transmission of 2019-nCov. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCoV. In addition, FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals, which considered as the potential target organ of the virus. However, report about the expression of FURIN and ACE2 in oral tissues was limited.

MethodsIn order to investigate the potential infective channel of new coronavirus in oral cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and FURIN that mediate the new coronavirus entry into host cells in oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining experiment was performed to confirm the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in the protein level.

ResultsThe bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. IHC experiments revealed that both the ACE2-positive and FURIN-positive cells in the target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in fibroblasts, which further confirm the bioinformatics results.

ConclusionsBased on these findings, we speculated that 2019-nCov could effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease. Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to 2019-nCov, which provides valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life.","NA"

Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug with in vitro and in vivo efficacy against coronaviruses. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsTo evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome, we used the recently established rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease. Two groups of six rhesus macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with intravenous remdesivir or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily. Clinical, virological and histological parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at necropsy to determine treatment efficacy.

ResultsIn contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs. Virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages were significantly reduced as early as 12hrs after the first treatment was administered. At necropsy on day 7 after inoculation, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were significantly lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue.

ConclusionsTherapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques. These data support early remdesivir treatment initiation in COVID-19 patients to prevent progression to severe pneumonia.","NA"

However, ESCRT association with the membrane is also mediated by electrostatic interactions with anionic phospholipids. Phospholipid distribution within natural biomembranes is inhomogeneous due to, for example, the formation of lipid rafts and curvature-driven lipid sorting. Here, we have used phase-separated giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to investigate the link between phosphatidylserine (PS)-rich lipid domains and ESCRT activity. We employ GUVs composed of phase separating lipid mixtures, where unsaturated DOPS and saturated DPPS lipids are incorporated individually or simultaneously to enhance PS localisation in liquid disordered (Ld) and/or liquid ordered (Lo) domains, respectively. PS partitioning between the coexisting phases is confirmed by a fluorescent Annexin V probe. Ultimately, we find that ILV generation promoted by ESCRTs is significantly enhanced when PS lipids localise within Ld domains. However, the ILVs that form are rich in Lo lipids. We interpret this surprising observation as preferential recruitment of the Lo phase beneath the ESCRT complex due to its increased rigidity, where the Ld phase is favoured in the neck of the resultant buds to facilitate the high membrane curvature in these regions of the membrane during the ILV formation process. Ld domains offer lower resistance to membrane bending, demonstrating a mechanism by which the composition and mechanics of membranes can be coupled to regulate the location and efficiency of ESCRT activity.","NA"

We previously identified a structural complex between receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met and {beta}1 integrin in metastases. Using novel cell culture and in vivo assays, we found that c-Met/{beta}1 complex induction promotes breast cancer intravasation and adhesion to the vessel wall, but does not increase extravasation. These effects may be driven by the ability of the c-Met/{beta}1 complex to increase mesenchymal and stem cell characteristics. Multiplex transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulated Wnt and hedgehog pathways after c-Met/{beta}1 complex induction. A {beta}1 integrin point mutation that prevented binding to c-Met reduced intravasation. OS2966, a therapeutic antibody disrupting c-Met/{beta}1 binding, decreased invasion and mesenchymal gene expression and morphology of breast cancer cells. Bone-seeking breast cancer cells exhibited higher c-Met/{beta}1 complex levels than parental controls and preferentially adhere to tissue-specific matrix. Patient bone metastases demonstrated higher c-Met/{beta}1 levels than brain metastases. Thus, the c-Met/{beta}1 complex drives breast cancer cell intravasation and preferential affinity for bone tissue-specific matrix.

TRIM5 is best known as a species-specific restriction factor that directly inhibits the viral life cycle. Additionally, it is also a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) that activates inflammatory signaling. How TRIM5 carries out its multi-faceted actions in antiviral defense remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that proteins required for autophagy, a cellular self-digestion pathway, play an important role in TRIM5s function as a PRR. Genetic depletion of proteins involved in all stages of the autophagy pathway prevented TRIM5-driven expression of NF-{kappa}B and AP1 responsive genes. One of these genes is the preeminent antiviral cytokine interferon {beta} (IFN-{beta}), whose TRIM5-dependent expression was lost in cells lacking the autophagy proteins ATG7, BECN1, and ULK1. Moreover, we found that the ability of TRIM5 to stimulate IFN-{beta} expression in response to recognition of a TRIM5-restricted HIV-1 capsid mutant (P90A) was abrogated in cells lacking autophagy factors. Stimulation of human macrophage-like cells with the P90A virus protected them against subsequent infection with an otherwise resistant wild type HIV-1 in a manner requiring TRIM5, BECN1, and ULK1. Mechanistically, TRIM5 was attenuated in its ability to activate the kinase TAK1 in autophagy deficient cells, and both BECN1 and ATG7 contributed to the assembly of TRIM5-TAK1 complexes. These data demonstrate a non-canonical role for the autophagy machinery in assembling antiviral signaling complexes and demonstrate a role for autophagy in the establishment of a TRIM5-dependent antiviral state.","NA"

Specifically, we used multiplex phospho-flow cytometry to measure the impact of variants on pERK, pGSK3{beta} and pCREB and high-content imaging to examine their subcellular localization. We find variants ranging from complete loss-of-function (LoF) to wildtype (WT)-like in their ability to regulate pERK and pGSK3{beta}, while all variants retain at least partial ability to regulate pCREB. Interestingly, our assays reveal that a high percentage of variants located within the disordered domain of unknown function that makes up the C-terminal half of SYNGAP1 exhibited LoF, compared to the more well studied catalytic domain. Moreover, we find protein instability to be a major contributor to dysfunction only for two missense variants both located within the catalytic domain. Using high-content imaging, we find variants with nuclear enrichment/exclusion and aberrant nuclear speckle localization. These variants are primarily located within the C2 domain known to mediate membrane lipid interactions.

It also contributes to the cellular pool of nicotinamide adenosine deoxynucleotide (NAD+) after conversion in the nicotinamide salvage pathway. Induction of Nkx6.1 expression in pancreatic endocrine progenitors by nicotinamide was mimicked by 3 PARP inhibitors (PJ34, olaparib, NU1025). Small molecule inhibition of the nicotinamide salvage pathway reduced Nkx6.1 expression but not Pdx1 expression and caused alteration in NAD+/NADH ratio. Nkx6.1 expression was not affected by sirtuin inhibition. Metabolic profiling of differentiating pancreatic and endocrine progenitors showed that oxygen consumption increases as differentiation progresses, and that nicotinamide reduces oxygen consumption rate. Expression of Nkx6.1 and other beta cell related genes, including Ins2 and Pdx1 increased in mouse islets after exposure to nicotinamide. In summary, nicotinamide induced Nkx6.1 expression in differentiating human pancreatic endocrine progenitors through inhibition of the PARP family of enzymes. Nicotinamide administration was also associated with increased NAD+/NADH ratio, without affecting Nkx6.1 expression. Similarly, the association between nicotinamide and Nkx6.1 expression was also seen in isolated mouse islets. These observations show a link between the regulation of beta cell identity and the effectors of NAD+ metabolism, suggesting possible therapeutic targets in the field of diabetes.","NA"

The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is an environment-sensing transcription factor that contributes to vascular development, and has been implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. We hypothesized that AHR can affect atherosclerosis by regulating phenotypic modulation of SMC.

MethodsWe combined RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq and in-vitro assays in human coronary artery SMC (HCASMC), with single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), histology, and RNAscope in an SMC-specific lineage-tracing Ahr knockout mouse model of atherosclerosis to better understand the role of AHR in vascular disease.

ResultsGenomic studies coupled with functional assays in cultured HCASMC revealed that AHR modulates HCASMC phenotype and suppresses ossification in these cells. Lineage tracing and activity tracing studies in the mouse aortic sinus showed that the Ahr pathway is active in modulated SMC in the atherosclerotic lesion cap. Furthermore, scRNA-Seq studies of the SMC-specific Ahr knockout mice showed a significant increase in the proportion of modulated SMC expressing chondrocyte markers such as Col2a1 and Alpl, which localized to the lesion neointima. These cells, which we term ""chondromyocytes"" (CMC), were also identified in the neointima of human coronary arteries. In histological analyses, these changes manifested as larger lesion size, increased lineage-traced SMC participation in the lesion, decreased lineage-traced SMC in the lesion cap, and increased alkaline phosphatase activity in lesions in the Ahr knockout compared to wild-type mice. We propose that AHR is likely protective based on these data and inference from human genetic analyses.

ConclusionOverall, we conclude that AHR promotes maintenance of lesion cap integrity and diminishes the disease related SMC-to-CMC transition in atherosclerotic tissues.","NA"

Alpha and beta isoforms exhibit different kinetics, ADP dissociates slower from actomyosin containing beta myosin isoform, therefore, beta myosin stays strongly bound to actin longer. We hypothesize that the electrostatic interactions in the force-generating region modulate affinity of ADP to actomyosin, and therefore, the time of the strong actomyosin binding. Wild type and the mutants of the myosin head construct (1-843 amino acid residues) were expressed in differentiated C2C12 cells, and duration of the strongly bound state of actomyosin was characterized using transient kinetics spectrophotometry.

We uncovered a mechanism that explains life-long maintenance of ASE neuron fate in C. elegans by the terminal selector transcription factor CHE-1. Fluctuations in CHE-1 level are buffered by the reservoir of CHE-1 bound at its target promoters, which ensure continued che-1 expression by preferentially binding the che-1 promoter. We validated this mechanism by showing that che-1 expression was resilient to induced transient CHE-1 depletion, while both expression of CHE-1 targets and ASE function were lost. We identified a 130 bp che-1 promoter fragment responsible for this resilience, with deletion of a homeodomain binding site in this fragment causing stochastic loss of ASE identity long after its determination. Because network architectures that support this mechanism are highly conserved in cell differentiation, it may explain stable cell fate maintenance in many systems.","NA"

Here, we found a substantial, albeit incomplete loss of liver sex bias in hepatocyte-specific STAT5a/STAT5b (collectively, STAT5)-deficient mouse liver. In male liver, many male-biased genes were down regulated in direct association with the loss of STAT5 binding; many female-biased genes, which show low STAT5 binding, were de-repressed, indicating an indirect mechanism for repression by STAT5. Extensive changes in CpG-methylation were seen in STAT5-deficient liver, where sex differences in DNA methylation were abolished at 88% of ~1,500 differentially-methylated regions, largely due to an increase in methylation at the hypomethylated sites. STAT5-dependent CpG-hypomethylation was rarely found at proximal promoters of STAT5-dependent genes. Rather, STAT5 primarily regulated the methylation of distal enhancers, where STAT5 deficiency induced widespread hypermethylation at genomic regions enriched for accessible chromatin, enhancer histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K27ac), STAT5 binding, and DNA motifs for STAT5 and other transcription factors implicated in liver sex differences. In conclusion, the sex-dependent binding of STAT5 to liver chromatin is closely linked to sex-dependent demethylation of distal regulatory elements mapping to STAT5-dependent genes important for liver sex bias.","NA"

We use validated models of chronic migraine to show that HDAC6-inhibition is an effective migraine treatment and reveal an undiscovered cytoarchitectural basis for migraine chronicity. The human migraine trigger, nitroglycerin, produced chronic migraine-associated pain and decreased neurite growth in pain-processing regions, and these were reversed by HDAC6 inhibition. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a physiological correlate of migraine aura, also caused decreased cortical neurite growth, while administration of HDAC6-inhibitor restored neuronal complexity and decreased CSD.

One strategy to identify novel molecular mechanisms of addiction is through functional genomic experimentation. However, results from individual experiments are often noisy. To address this problem, the convergent analysis of multiple genomic experiments can prioritize signal from these studies. In the present study, we examine genetic loci identified in the recombinant inbred (BXD RI) genetic reference population that modulate the locomotor response to cocaine. We then applied the GeneWeaver software system for heterogeneous functional genomic analysis to integrate and aggregate multiple studies of addiction genomics, resulting in the identification of Rab3b, as a functional correlate of the locomotor response to cocaine in rodents. This gene encodes a member of the RAB family of Ras-like GTPases known to be involved in trafficking of secretory and endocytic vesicles in eukaryotic cells. The convergent evidence for a role of Rab3b was included co-occurrence in previously published genetic mapping studies of cocaine related behaviors; methamphetamine response and Cartpt (Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript prepropeptide) abundance; evidence related to other addictive substances; density of polymorphisms; and its expression pattern in reward pathways. To evaluate this finding, we examined the effect of RAB3 complex perturbation in cocaine response. B6;129-Rab3btm1Sud Rab3ctm1sud Rab3dtm1sud triple null mice (Rab3bcd-/-) exhibited significant deficits in habituation, and increased acute and repeated cocaine responses. This previously unidentified mechanism of the behavioral predisposition and response to cocaine is an example of many that can be identified and validated using aggregate genomic studies.

Many genetic and genomic studies have been performed over the past few decades, representing a wealth of data on the underlying neurobiological and genetic basis of multiple complex behaviors. However, these studies, particularly legacy studies using older technologies and resources lack precision. By aggregating multiple studies, convergent evidence for shared molecular mechanisms of multiple behaviors can be found, for example the widely reported relations among psychostimulant use and novelty response behavior. Here a legacy genetic mapping result for a cocaine related trait mapped in mice was refined using data from 113 different experimental gene sets related to addiction in the GeneWeaver system for heterogeneous functional genomic analysis. Convergent evidence revealed a role for Rab3b in this and other traits including multiple psychostimulant responses and CART expression. Experimental perturbation of the RAB complex revealed effects on habituation to a novel environment, cocaine induced activation and Carpt expression. The analysis of aggregate data thus revealed a molecular mechanism that influences the relationship between response to novel situations and cocaine-related phenotypes.","NA"

These mice survived postnatally, but had significant defects in bones and teeth, including reduced mineralization and short roots. H&E staining revealed reduced axon-like structures in the mutant mice. Reporter imaging demonstrated that Osterix-Cre activity was localized within the tooth and was active in the DP and derivatives, but not in neurons. Previous research has established that paracrine signals from the dental pulp attract trigeminal axons toward and into the tooth during postnatal development, yet very little is known about the signals that regulate tooth innervation. Immunofluorescent staining for a neuronal marker, {beta}3 tubulin, was performed on serial cryosections from control and mutant molars at two different postnatal stages. Confocal imaging and pixel quantification of {beta}3 tubulin demonstrated reduced innervation in P7 and P24 Tgfbr2cko first molars compared to controls, indicating that the signals necessary to promote neurite outgrowth were disrupted by Tgfbr2 deletion. Quantitative real time PCR showed that the mRNA expression levels of several neuronal genes were reduced. Lastly, trigeminal neurons were co-cultured atop Transwell filters overlying primary Tgfbr2f/f DP cells. Tgfbr2 in the DP was deleted with an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase. Confocal imaging of axons through the filter pores showed increased axonal sprouting from neurons cultured in the presence of Tgfbr2-positive DP cells compared to neurons cultured alone. Further, axon sprouting was reduced when Tgfbr2 was knocked down in the DP cells. These results indicate that Tgfbr2 in the DP mesenchyme regulates paracrine signals that guide sensory innervation of the tooth.

We estimated the heritability of five body and three antler traits in a free-ranging population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada.

Heritability in male-only antler features ranged from 0.00 to 0.51 and had high standard errors. We explored the influence of minor allele frequency and data completion filters on h2: GRMs derived from fewer SNPs had reduced h2 estimates and the relatedness coefficients significantly deviated from those generated with more SNPs. As a corollary, we discussed limitations to the application of GRMs in the wild, notably how skewed GRMs increase variance around h2 estimates. This is the first study to estimate h2 on a free-ranging population of white-tailed deer and should be informative for breeding designs and management.","NA"

Irrespective of the differentiation or activation status, the correlation coefficient of human CD8+ T cells reached a mere 0.41-0.43. Only gene classes that mediate conserved cellular processes such as protein translation or cellular metabolism showed a strong correlation of mRNA with protein expression. In contrast, the mRNA expression and protein output of transcription factors, cell surface molecules, and secreted proteins - including cytokines - only mildly correlated. Conversely, highly conserved genes correlated well with the protein output.

We then studied the physiology of anterior lateral line in immobilised tadpoles. Activating the neuromasts behind one eye could evoke asymmetrical motor nerve discharges when the tadpole was resting, suggestive of turning/escape, followed by fictive swimming. When the tadpole was already producing fictive swimming however, anterior lateral line activation reliably led to the termination of swimming. The anterior lateral line had spontaneous afferent discharges at rest, and when activated showed typical adaptation. There were also efferent activities during tadpole swimming, the activity of which was loosely in phase with ipsilateral motor nerve discharges, implying modulation by the motor circuit from the same side.

The protocol has been developed for the in silico search of ligands of unexplored therapeutic targets, for which limited information about ligands or ligand-receptor structures is available. It implements an integrative funnel-like strategy with filtering layers that increase in computational accuracy. The protocol starts with a pharmacophore-based virtual screening strategy that uses ligand-free receptor conformations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Then, it performs a molecular docking stage using several docking programs and an exponential consensus ranking strategy. The last filter, samples the conformations of compounds bound to the target using MD simulations. The MD conformations are scored using several traditional scoring functions in combination with a newly-proposed score that takes into account the fluctuations of the molecule with a Morse-based potential. The protocol was optimized and validated using a compound library with known ligands of the Corynebacterium ammoniagenes FADS. Then, it was used to find new FADS ligands from a compound library of 14,000 molecules. A small set of 17 in silico filtered molecules were tested experimentally. We identified five inhibitors of the activity of the flavin adenylyl transferase mononucleotide of the FADS, and some of them were able to inhibit growth of three bacterial species: Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, where the former two are human pathogens. Overall, the results show that the integrative VS protocol is a cost-effective solution for the discovery of ligands of unexplored therapeutic targets.

Biological rhythms are important adaptations to the temporal dimension of niches, but the role of other organisms in determining such temporal niches have not been much studied, and the role specifically of competition even less so. We investigate how interspecific and intraspecific competition for resources shapes an organisms activity rhythms. For this, communities of one or two species in an environment with limited resource input were simulated. We demonstrate that when organisms are arrhythmic, one species will always be competitively excluded from the environment, but the existence of activity rhythms allows niche differentiation and indefinite coexistence of the two species. Two species which are initially active at the same phase will differentiate their phase angle of entrainment over time to avoid each other. When only one species is present in an environment, competition within individuals of the species strongly selects for niche expansion through arrhythmicity, but the addition of an interspecific competitor facilitates evolution of increased rhythmic amplitude when combined with additional adaptations for temporal specialization. Finally, if individuals preferentially mate with others who are active at similar times of day, then disruptive selection by intraspecific competition can split one population into two reproductively isolated groups. In summary, these simulations suggest that biological rhythms are an effective method to temporally differentiate ecological niches, and that competition is an important ecological pressure promoting the evolution of rhythms and sleep.

Author summaryWhy do we sleep? We are interested in the ecological factors which promote the evolution of biological rhythms like the sleep-wake cycle, focusing especially on competition. When animals compete with each other for resources, they often evolve to avoid each other by specializing to use different resources or separating their activity in other ways. To test hypotheses about how competition shapes rest-activity rhythms, we performed computer simulations of a community of animals who move, reproduce, and compete for resources. We show that biological rhythms let two species divide time so that one species is active while its competitor is resting, thus avoiding depleting shared resources. When a species has no competitors in the simulation, competition between members of the same species cause population and individual rhythms to decrease, since resource availability is low when everybody is active at the same time. However, having competitors allows strong rhythms to evolve from originally arrhythmic organisms. Competition can even cause a single population to split into two species which are separated in time. In summary, these results suggest that competition is a strong factor promoting rest-activity rhythms.","NA"

Ferrets undergo significant variation in body weight seasonally, affected by photoperiod, and these variations make it difficult to use weight as an indicator of health status. To overcome this requires a better understanding of these seasonal weight changes. We provide a normative weight data set for the female ferret accounting for seasonal changes, and also investigate the effect of fluid regulation on weight change. Female ferrets (n=39) underwent behavioural testing from May 2017 to August 2019 and were weighed daily while housed in an animal care facility with controlled light exposure. In the winter (October to March), animals experienced 10 hours of light and 14 hours of dark, while in summer (March to October), this contingency was reversed. Individual animals varied in their body weight from approximately 700 to 1200 g. However, weights fluctuated with light cycle, with animals losing weight in summer, and gaining weight in winter such that they fluctuated between approximately 80% and 120% of their long term average weight. Ferrets were weighed as part of their health assessment while experiencing water regulation for behavioural training. Water regulation superimposed additional weight changes on these seasonal fluctuations, with weight loss during the 5 day water regulation period being greater in summer than winter. These data establish a normative benchmark for seasonal weight variation in female ferrets that can be incorporated into the health assessment of an animals condition.","NA"

Most studies focus on the cytotoxicity incurred by a high concentration of [Zn2+]c and less investigate the [Zn2+]c at physiological levels. Zinc oxide-nanoparticle (ZnO-NP) is blood brain barrier-permeable and elevates the [Zn2+]c to different levels according to the concentrations of ZnO-NP applied. In this study, we mildly elevated the [Zn2+]c by zinc oxide-nanoparticles (ZnO-NP) at concentrations below 1 g/ml, which had little cytotoxicity, in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and characterized the importance of Zn2+ transporters in 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cell death. The results show that ZnO-NP at low concentrations elevated the [Zn2+]c transiently in 6 hr, then declined gradually to a basal level in 24 hr. Knocking down the expression levels of ZnT1 (mostly at the plasma membrane) and ZIP8 (present in endosomes and lysosomes) increased and decreased the ZnO-NP-induced elevation of [Zn2+]c, respectively. ZnO-NP treatment reduced the basal levels of reactive oxygen species and Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratios; in addition, ZnO-NP decreased the 6-OHDA-induced ROS production, p53 expression, and cell death. Therefore, mild elevations in [Zn2+]c induced by ZnO-NP activate beneficial effects in reducing the 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxic effects. Therefore, brain-delivery of ZnO-NP can be regarded as a potential therapy for neurological disease.","NA"

Methods160 rats were divided into 4 groups: (EP-NT) rats with EP and no alcohol exposure; (EP-A14) rats with EP exposed to 14% alcohol; (EP-A25) rats with EP exposed to 25% alcohol; (EP-A36) rats with EP exposed to 36% alcohol. The animals from the EP-A14, EP-A25 and EP-A36 groups were subjected to different concentrations of alcohol 30 days before EP induction. The histological characteristics, percentage of bone in the furcation (PBF) and bone metabolism in the furcation region were evaluated. The PBF and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) data were subjected to statistical analysis.

ResultsThe EP-A14, EP-A25 and EP-A36 groups had lower PBFs compared with the EP-NT group. A more severe inflammatory process and a greater number of TRAP+ cells were also observed. In the EP-A14, EP-A25 and EP-A36 groups, the inflammatory process became more severe as the ingested alcoholic concentration increased. An increase in RANKL immunostaining and a significantly higher number of TRAP+ cells were also observed.

ConclusionWe conclude that chronic alcohol consumption increases the severity of experimental periodontitis in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the magnitude of local inflammatory responses and stimulating alveolar bone resorption.","NA"

While many computational tools exist for the analysis of Ribo-seq data, including those that assess differences in translational efficiency between conditions, no tool currently exists for rigorous test of the pattern differences in ribosome footprint. In this paper we propose a novel approach together with an R package, RiboDiPA, for Differential PPattern Analysis of Ribo-seq data. RiboDiPA allows for quick identification of genes with statistically significant differences in ribosome occupancy patterns for model organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. We show that differential pattern analysis reveals information that is distinct and complimentary to the existing methods that focus on translational efficiency analysis. Using both simulated Ribo-seq footprint data and two benchmark data sets, we illustrate that RiboDiPA can not only uncover meaningful global translational differences between conditions, but also the detailed differential ribosome binding patterns to a single codon resolution.","NA"

We show that while on average populations will converge to desired distributions over forage patches both with and without negative feedback signals, in small populations negative feedback reduces variation around the target distribution compared to the use of positive feedback alone. Our results are independent of the nature of the target distribution, providing it can be achieved by foragers collecting only local information.

In this explanation, local species interactions are assumed to play a minor role in the formation of the regional species pool, which is instead thought to be driven by speciation and dispersal occurring across larger areas. Here, we provide evidence suggesting a more important role of local species interactions than generally assumed. In an experiment in which we assembled 320 local communities of root-associated fungi under 80 species pools, we varied the species richness of the experimental species pools and the mean age of the sites from which we collected the fungal species across a 4-myr soil chronosequence in Hawaii. We found that realized local species diversity in the assembled communities increased more extensively with increasing species-pool richness when species were from older sites. We also found that older species pools had lower functional and phylogenetic diversity, indicating that the evolution of greater competitive equivalence among potential colonists enabled higher local diversity under older species pools. Our results suggest that the tendency of older regions to have higher local richness arises not simply because older species pools are more speciose, but also because the constituent species have evolved traits that allow them to co-occur more readily in local communities.","NA"

Single-cell sequencing showed that resistant genotype frequency plateaued when cells were co-infected with sensitive and resistant genotypes, suggesting a sharing of viral proteins in co-infected cells (complementation) which masks genotypic differences.

Yet, in a number of sexually dimorphic species, male mate choice also results in behavioral isolation. In many of these cases, the female traits that mediate species boundaries are unclear. Females in sexually dimorphic species typically lack many of the elaborate traits that are present in males and that are often diagnostic of species. In a diverse and largely sexually dimorphic group of fishes called darters (Percidae: Etheostoma), male mate choice contributes to behavioral isolation between a number of species; however, it is not clear which female traits males prefer. In the current study, we identified the dominant female pattern for two sympatric species, Etheostoma zonale and E. barrenense, using pattern energy analysis, and we used discriminate function analysis to identify which aspects of female patterning can reliably classify species. We then tested the role of female features in male mate choice for E. zonale, by measuring male preference for computer animations displaying the identified (species-specific) conspecific features as well as the dominant male pattern that is preferred by females. We found that the region above the lateral line is important in mediating male mate preferences, with males spending significantly more time with animations exhibiting conspecific female patterning in this region than with animations exhibiting heterospecific female patterning. Our results suggest that the aspects of female phenotypes that are the target of male mate choice are different from the male phenotypes that characterize species.

A unique phenotype exhibited by certain isolates of C. auris is their ability to form small clusters of cells known as aggregates, which have been to a limited extent described in the context of pathogenic traits. In this study, we screened several non-aggregative and aggregative C. auris isolates for biofilm formation, where we observed a level of heterogeneity amongst the different phenotypes. Next, we utilised an RNA-sequencing approach to investigate the transcriptional responses during biofilm formation of a non-aggregative and aggregative isolate of the initial pool. Observations from these analyses indicate unique transcriptional profiles in the two isolates, with several genes identified relating to proteins involved in adhesion and invasion of the host in other fungal species. From these findings we investigated for the first time the fungal recognition and inflammatory responses of a three-dimensional skin epithelial model to these isolates. In these models, a wound was induced to mimic a portal of entry for C. auris. We show both phenotypes elicited minimal response in the model minus induction of the wound, yet in the wounded tissue both phenotypes induced a greater response, with the aggregative isolate more pro-inflammatory. This capacity of aggregative C. auris biofilms to generate such responses in the wounded skin highlights how this opportunistic yeast is a high risk within the intensive care environment where susceptible patients have multiple indwelling lines.

ImportanceCandida auris has recently emerged as an important cause of concern within healthcare environments due to its ability to persist and tolerate commonly used antiseptics and disinfectants, particularly when surface attached (biofilms). This yeast is able to colonise and subsequently infect patients, particularly those that are critically ill or immunosuppressed, which may result in death. We have undertaken analysis on two different types of this yeast, using molecular and immunological tools to determine whether either of these has a greater ability to cause serious infections. We describe that both isolates exhibit largely different transcriptional profiles during biofilm development. Finally, we show that the inability to form small aggregates (or clusters) of cells has an adverse effect on the organisms immuno-stimulatory properties, suggestive the non-aggregative phenotype may exhibit a certain level of immune evasion.","NA"

Their function, numbers and change at synapses during synaptic plasticity, is tightly regulated by neuronal activity. Although we know that long-distance transport of AMPARs is essential for this regulation, we dont understand the regulatory mechanisms of it. Neuronal transmission is a metabolically demanding process in which ATP consumption and production are tightly coupled and regulated. Aerobic ATP synthesis unavoidably produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, which are known modulators of calcium signaling. Although a role for calcium signaling in AMPAR transport has been described, there is little understanding of the mechanisms involved and no known link to physiological ROS signaling. Here, using real-time in vivo imaging of AMPAR transport in the intact C. elegans nervous system, we demonstrate that long-distance synaptic AMPAR transport is bidirectionally regulated by calcium influx and activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Quantifying in vivo calcium dynamics revealed that modest, physiological increases in ROS decrease calcium transients in C. elegans glutamatergic neurons. By combining genetic and pharmacological manipulation of ROS levels and calcium influx, we reveal a mechanism in which physiological increases in ROS cause a decrease in synaptic AMPAR transport and delivery by modulating activity-dependent calcium signaling. Taken together, our results identify a novel role for oxidant signaling in the regulation of synaptic AMPAR transport and delivery, which in turn could be critical for coupling the metabolic demands of neuronal activity with excitatory neurotransmission.

SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACTSynaptic AMPARs are critical for excitatory synaptic transmission. The disruption of their synaptic localization and numbers is associated with numerous psychiatric, neurological, and neurodegenerative conditions. However, very little is known about the regulatory mechanisms controlling transport and delivery of AMPAR to synapses. Here, we describe a novel physiological signaling mechanism in which ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide, modulate AMPAR transport by modifying activity-dependent calcium influx. Our findings provide the first evidence in support of a mechanistic link between physiological ROS signaling, AMPAR transport, localization, and excitatory transmission. Of potential therapeutic importance, dysregulation of intracellular calcium and ROS signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease.","NA"

We investigated the effect of precision modulations on these cross-modal predictive mechanisms, via attention and interoceptive ability. We presented auditory sequences at short (perceived synchronous) or long (perceived asynchronous) cardio-audio delays, with half of the trials including an omission. Participants attended to the cardio-audio synchronicity of the tones (internal attention) or the auditory stimuli alone (external attention). Comparing HEPs during omissions allowed for the observation of pure predictive signals, without contaminating auditory input. We observed an early effect of cardio-audio delay, reflecting a difference in heartbeat-driven expectations. We also observed a larger positivity to omissions of sounds perceived as synchronous than to omissions of sounds perceived as asynchronous when attending internally only, consistent with the role of attentional precision for enhancing predictions.

Chromosomes may help on this goal, by providing information on the processes underlying speciation. Thus, cytogenetic analyses were carried out in the subtribe in order to establish its chromosome number and morphology. Physalidinae is characterized by x = 12 and most species shows a highly asymmetric karyotype. These karyotype traits were mapped onto a molecular phylogeny to test the congruence between karyotype evolution and clade differentiation. A diploid ancestor was reconstructed for the subtribe, and five to six polyploidy independent events were estimated, plus one aneuploidy event (X = 11 in the monotypic genus Quincula). Comparative phylogenetic methods showed that asymmetry indices and chromosome arm ratio (r) have a high phylogenetic signal, whereas the number of telocentric and submetacentric chromosomes presented a conspicuous amount of changes. Karyotype asymmetry allow us to differentiate genera within the subtribe. Overall, our study suggests that Physalidineae diversification has been accompanied by karyotype changes, which can be applied to delimit genera within the group.","NA"

Individuals infected with HIV-1 encoding defective nef genes do not develop AIDS for decades2,3. A key target of Nef is the cellular receptor CD4. Although essential for viral entry into host cells, CD4 is problematic for the virus later in its replication cycle: CD4 disrupts processing of the viral glycoprotein, Env, inhibiting infectivity4; it interferes with the release of new virions5,6; and it causes vulnerability to superinfection, causing premature cell death and limiting viral productivity7. Furthermore, binding of CD4 to Env exposes otherwise-concealed Env epitopes, rendering infected cells more susceptible to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and virus particles more susceptible to neutralizing antibodies8-10. HIV-1 has evolved strategies to mitigate these problems. Newly synthesized CD4 is targeted in the endoplasmic reticulum by the viral Vpu protein for proteasomal degradation11. Surface-expressed CD4, in contrast, is targeted by Nef for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation12-15. Nefs effect on CD4 involves hijacking of clathrin adaptor complex 2 (AP2)-dependent endocytosis16,17. Although how Nef associates with a part of the tetrameric AP2 is understood18, a complete understanding of the interaction, especially how CD4 is sequestered by Nef into a complex with AP2, has remained elusive. Here, we present a high-resolution crystal structure that describes the underlying mechanism. An intricate combination of conformational changes occurs in both Nef and AP2 to enable CD4 binding and downregulation. Strikingly, a pocket on Nef previously identified as crucial for recruiting class I MHC is also responsible for recruiting CD4, revealing a potential approach to inhibit two of Nefs activities and sensitize the virus to immune clearance","NA"

In earlier work we proposed a reduced order model in which the spine was viewed as an S-shaped elastic rod under torsion and bending. Here, we simulate the deformation of S-shaped rods of a wide range of curvatures and inflection points under a fixed mechanical loading. Our analysis determines three distinct axial projection patterns of these S-shaped rods: two loop (in opposite directions) patterns and one lemniscate pattern. We further identify the curve characteristics associated with each deformation pattern showing that for rods deforming in a loop 1 shape the position of the inflection point is the highest and the curvature of the rod is smaller compared to the other two types. For rods deforming in the loop 2 shape the position of the inflection point is the lowest (closer to the fixed base) and the curvatures are higher than the other two types. These patterns matched the common clinically observed scoliotic curves - Lenke 1 and Lenke 5. Our elastic rod model predicts deformations that are similar to those of a pediatric spine and it can differentiate between the clinically observed deformation patterns.

Due to potential mobilization or conjugation capabilities, plasmids are important genetic vehicles for antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors with huge and increasing clinical implications. They are therefore subject to large genomic studies within the scientific community worldwide. As a result of rapidly improving next generation sequencing methods, the amount of sequenced bacterial genomes is constantly increasing, in turn raising the need for specialized tools to (i) extract plasmid sequences from draft assemblies, (ii) derive their origin and distribution, and (iii) further investigate their genetic repertoire. Recently, several bioinformatic methods and tools have emerged to tackle this issue; however, a combination of both high sensitivity and specificity in plasmid sequence identification is rarely achieved in a taxon-independent manner. In addition, many software tools are not appropriate for large high-throughput analyses or cannot be included into existing software pipelines due to their technical design or software implementation. In this study, we investigated differences in the replicon distributions of protein-coding genes on a large scale as a new approach to distinguish plasmid-borne from chromosome-borne contigs. We defined and computed statistical discrimination thresholds for a new metric: the replicon distribution score (RDS) which achieved an accuracy of 96.6%. The final performance was further improved by the combination of the RDS metric with heuristics exploiting several plasmid specific higher-level contig characterizations.

However, ease-of-use for execution and data analysis remains a barrier-of-entry to the adoption of metagenomics in applied health and forensics settings. In addition, these venues often have more stringent requirements for reporting, accuracy, and precision than the traditional ecological research role of the technology. Here, we present PanGIA (Pan-Genomics for Infectious Agents), a novel bioinformatics analysis platform for hosting, processing, analyzing, and reporting shotgun metagenomics data of complex samples suspected of containing one or more pathogens. PanGIA was developed to address gaps that often preclude clinicians, medical technicians, forensics personnel, or other non-expert end-users from the routine application of metagenomics for pathogen identification. Though primarily designed to detect pathogenic microorganisms within clinical and environmental metagenomics data, PanGIA also serves as an analytical framework for microbial community profiling and comparative metagenomics. To provide statistical confidence in PanGIAs taxonomic assignments, the system provides two independent estimations of probability for species and strain level detection. First, PanGIA integrates coverage data with  uniqueness information mapped across each reference genome for a stand-alone determination of confidence for each query sequence at each taxonomy level. Second, if a negative-control sample is provided, PanGIA compares this sample with a corresponding experimental unknown sample and determines a measure of confidence associated with  detection above background. An integrated graphical user interface allows interactive interrogation and enables users to summarize multiple sample results by confidence score, normalized read abundance, reference genome linear coverage, depth-of-coverage, RPKM, and other metrics to detect specific organisms-of-interest. Comparison testing of the PanGIA algorithm against a number of recent k-mer, read-mapping, and marker-gene based taxonomy classifiers across various real-world datasets with spiked targets shows superior mean positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity. PanGIA can process a five million paired-end read dataset in under 1 hour on commodity computational hardware.

We shown that this approach outperforms the results obtained when using Horvaths method, neural networks directly, or when using other training algorithms, such as Levenberg-Marquardts algorithm. The R-squared value obtained when using our proposed approach in empirical (out-of sample) data was 0.934, compared to 0.914 when using a different training algorithm (Levenberg Marquard), or 0.910 when applying the neural network directly (e.g. without first reducing the dimensionality of the data). The results were also tested in independent datasets that were not used during the training phase. Our method obtained better R-squared values and RMSE than Horvaths and Levines method in 8 independent datasets. We demonstrate that building an age predictor using a Bayesian based algorithm provides accurate age predictions.

In particular, climbing plants capitalize on their slender structures to successfully negotiate unstructured environments, while employing a combination of two classes of growth-driven movements: tropic responses, which direct growth in the direction of an external stimulus, and inherent nastic movements, such as periodic circumnutations, which promote exploration. In order to emulate these complex growth dynamics in a 3D environment, a general and rigorous mathematical framework is required. Here we develop a general 3D model for rod-like organs adopting the Frenet-Serret frame, providing a useful framework from the standpoint of robotics control. Differential growth drives the dynamics of the organ, governed by both internal and external cues. We describe the numerical method required to implement this model, and perform numerical simulations of a number of key scenarios, showcasing the applicability of our model. In the case of responses to external stimuli, we consider a distant stimulus (such as sunlight and gravity), a point stimulus (a point light source), and a line stimulus which emulates twining of a climbing plant around a support. We also simulate circumnutations, the response to an internal oscillatory cue, associated with search processes. Lastly we also demonstrate the superposition of both the response to an external stimulus together with circumnutations. Lastly we consider a simple example illustrating the possible use of an optimal control approach in order to recover tropic dynamics, in a way which may be relevant for robotics use. In all, the model presented here is general and robust, paving the way for a deeper understanding of plant response dynamics, as well as novel control systems for newly developed self-growing robots.","NA"

To identify the direct targets of Notch that produce these phenotypes, we introduced a conditional Notch transgene into squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, which respond to Notch activation in 2D culture and in organoid cultures by undergoing differentiation. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses show that in squamous cells Notch activates a context-specific program of gene expression that depends on lineage-specific regulatory elements, most of which lie in long- range enhancers. Among the direct Notch target genes are multiple DNA damage response genes, including IER5, which is regulated by Notch through several enhancer elements. We show that IER5 is required for Notch-induced differentiation in squamous carcinoma cells and in TERT-immortalized keratinocytes. Its function is epistatic to PPP2R2A, which encodes the B55 subunit of PP2A, and IER5 interacts with B55 in cells and in purified systems. These results show that Notch and DNA-damage response pathways converge in squamous cells and that some components of these pathways promote differentiation, which may serve to eliminate DNA-damaged cells from the proliferative pool in squamous epithelia. Crosstalk involving Notch and PP2A may enable Notch signaling to be tuned and integrated with other pathways that regulate squamous differentiation. Our work also suggests that squamous cell carcinomas remain responsive to Notch signaling, providing a rationale for reactivation of Notch as a therapeutic strategy in these cancers.

Lsm1-7 loads onto RNA from the 3' end and removal of the Lsm1 C-terminal region allows Lsm1-7 to scan along RNA, suggesting a gated mechanism for accessing internal binding sites.

The Cirit showed remarkable performance in accurate detection and quantification of circRNAs via comparing with current methods from different aspects. Using Cirit, we detected 28,813 nonredundant human circRNAs from 91 transcriptome datasets, as well as 2,385 circRNAs from four understudied organisms. Subsequent analyses found that the majority of human circRNAs expressed spatiotemporally; only a very small portion of circRNAs were back-splice junction (BSJ)-consistent (maximally 5.17%) or sequence-consistent (under 2%). Furthermore, circRNA genesis were relatively flexible that only about 60% of human circRNAs used the canonical GT-AG pattern for back-splice. The inconsistent expression of circRNAs challenges their roles as precise transcriptional regulators.

ConclusionsIn summary, the reference-free method provides a straightforward and universal way for reliable circRNA research. It will largely boost the successful rate in designing highly specific probes to monitor circRNA behavior in cell. In particular, it brings circRNA research to the organisms that have no genome or draft genome.","NA"

If true it has fundamental consequences for our understanding of the regulation of biological functions during an action potential. It has long been known that the electrical dipoles in the neuronal membrane reorient during an action potential, observed through a variety of optical methods. However, this information has been insufficient to confirm if and how the collective thermodynamic state of the neuronal membrane changes during an action potential. Here, we show that hyperspectral stimulated Raman spectroscopy can resolve the thermodynamic state of the neuronal membranes in a single neuron during an action potential. Based on these measurements we provide the first evidence that the system condenses during the de-polarisation phase and melts during the polarisation phase.

Statement of SignificanceWhile action-potentials can be measured using a variety of methods, none of these methods have been able to provide sufficient information to characterise the collective thermodynamic state of the membrane during an action-potential. Therefore, new tools are required to satisfactorily resolve the fundamental nature of the phenomenon, i.e. does the wave-front propagates irreversibly/diffusively as in the burning of a fuse, or reversibly/elastically as in the propagation of sound. It has been postulated that if action-potentials indeed propagate elastically, then the membrane must undergo a localised condensation during the action-potential. This article confirms and quantifies the condensation of the membrane during an action-potential based on time-resolved changes in the Raman band at 2930 cm-1, also known as the ""melting-marker"".","NA"

Since the analyses are affected by both positive and negative selection, studies usually assume constant negative selection in the time span of interest. For this reason, hundreds of studies that conclude adaptive evolution might have reported false signals caused by relaxed negative selection. We test this suspicion two ways. First, we analyze the fluctuation in population size, N, during evolution. For example, the evolutionary rate in the primate phylogeny could vary by as much as 2000 fold due to the variation in N alone. Second, we measure the variation in negative selection directly by analyzing the polymorphism data from four taxa (Drosophila, Arabidopsis, primates, and birds, with 64 species in total). The strength of negative selection, as measured by the ratio of nonsynonymous/synonymous polymorphisms, fluctuates strongly and at multiple time scales. The two approaches suggest that the variation in the strength of negative selection may be responsible for the bulk of the reported adaptive genome evolution in the last two decades. This study corroborates the recent report1 on the inconsistent patterns of adaptive genome evolution. Finally, we discuss the path forward in detecting adaptive sequence evolution.","NA"

Little is known about community succession within the belowground seagrass microbiome after disturbance and its potential role in the plants recovery after transplantation. We transplanted Zostera marina shoots with and without an intact rhizosphere and cultivated plants for four weeks while characterizing microbiome recovery and effects on plant traits. Rhizosphere and root microbiomes were compositionally distinct, likely representing discrete microbial niches. Furthermore, microbiomes of washed transplants were initially different from those of sod transplants, and recovered to resemble an undisturbed state within fourteen days. Conspicuously, changes in microbial communities of washed transplants corresponded with changes in rhizosphere sediment mass and root biomass, highlighting the strength and responsive nature of the relationship between plants, their microbiome, and the environment. Potential mutualistic microbes that were enriched over time include those that function in the cycling and turnover of sulfur, nitrogen, and plant-derived carbon in the rhizosphere environment. These findings highlight the importance and resiliency of the seagrass microbiome after disturbance. Consideration of the microbiome will have meaningful implications on habitat restoration practices.

ImportanceSeagrasses are important coastal species that are declining globally, and transplantation can be used to combat these declines. However, the bacterial communities associated with seagrass rhizospheres and roots (the microbiome) are often disturbed or removed completely prior to transplantation. The seagrass microbiome benefits seagrasses through metabolite, nutrient, and phytohormone exchange, and contributes to the ecosystem services of seagrass meadows by cycling sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon. This experiment aimed to characterize the importance and resilience of the seagrass belowground microbiome by transplanting Zostera marina with and without intact rhizospheres and tracking microbiome and plant morphological recovery over four weeks. We found the seagrass microbiome to be resilient to transplantation disturbance, recovering after fourteen days. Additionally, microbiome recovery was linked with seagrass morphology, coinciding with increases in rhizosphere sediment mass and root biomass. Results of this study can be used to include microbiome responses in informing future restoration work.","NA"

Because nitrogenase, an enzyme for nitrogen fixation, is easily inactivated by oxygen, the intracellular environment of heterocysts is kept microoxic. In heterocysts, the oxygen-evolving photosystem II is inactivated, a heterocyst-specific envelope with an outer polysaccharide layer and an inner glycolipid layer is formed to limit oxygen entry, and oxygen consumption is activated. Heterocyst differentiation, which is accompanied by drastic morphological and physiological changes, requires strictly controlled gene expression systems. Here, we investigated the functions of a CRP-family transcriptional regulator, DevH, in the process of heterocyst differentiation. A devH-knockdown strain, devHKD, was created by replacing the original promoter with the gifA promoter, which is repressed during heterocyst differentiation. Although devHKD formed morphologically distinct cells with the heterocyst envelope polysaccharide layer, it was unable to grow diazotrophically. Genes involved in construction of the microoxic environment, such as cox operons and the hgl island, were not upregulated in devHKD. Moreover, expression of the nif gene cluster was completely abolished. Even under anaerobic conditions, the nif gene cluster was not induced in devHKD.

Here, we propose an approach for quantifying functional redundancy that use  omics data. This approach, termed trait contribution evenness (TCE), is based on traditional measures of community diversity. We measure functional redundancy of a trait within a community as the evenness in relative contribution of that trait among taxa within the community. This definition has several appealing properties including: TCE is an extension of established diversity theory, functional redundancy measurements from communities with different richness and relative trait contribution by taxa are easily comparable, and any quantifiable trait data (genes copies, protein abundance, transcript copies, respiration rates, etc.) is suitable for analysis. Resilience of a trait to taxa extinctions is often viewed as an ecological consequence of traits with high functional redundancy. We demonstrate that TCE functional redundancy is closely and monotonically related to the resilience of a trait to extinctions of trait-bearing taxa. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of TCE, we analyzed the functional redundancy of eight nitrogen-transforming pathways using 2,631 metagenome-assembled genomes from 47 TARA Oceans sites. We found that the NH4+ assimilation pathway was the most functionally redundant (0.6 to 0.7) while nitrification had the lowest functional redundancy (0 to 0.1). Here, TCE functional redundancy addresses shortfalls of other functional redundancy measurements by providing a generalizable, quantitative, and comparable functional redundancy measurement.

ImportanceThe broad application of  omics technologies in microbiological studies highlights the necessity of integrating traditional ecological theory with omics data when quantifying community functional redundancy. Such an approach should allow for comparisons in functional redundancy between different samples, sites, and studies. Here, we propose measuring functional redundancy based on an expansion of already existing diversity theory. This approach measures how evenly different members in a community contribute to the overall level of a trait within a community. The utility in the approach proposed here will allow for broad evaluation of traits.","NA"

This has significantly limited high throughput studies of unusual or atypical glycosylation events such as those observed in bacteria. As such, computational approaches to examine bacterial glycosylation and identify chemically diverse glycans are desperately needed. Here we describe the use of wide-tolerance (up to 2000 Da) open searching as a means to rapidly examine bacterial glycoproteomes. We benchmarked this approach using N-linked glycopeptides of Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus as well as O-linked glycopeptides of Acinetobacter baumannii and Burkholderia cenocepacia revealing glycopeptides modified with a range of glycans can be readily identified without defining the glycan masses prior to database searching.

Batch effects can mask true biological results and/or result in irreproducible conclusions and interpretations. Low biomass samples in microbiome research are prone to reagent contamination; yet, quality control procedures for low biomass samples in large-scale microbiome studies are not well established.

ResultsIn this study we have proposed a framework for an in-depth step-by-step approach to address this gap. The framework consists of three independent stages: 1) verification of sequencing accuracy by assessing technical repeatability and reproducibility of the results using mock communities and biological controls; 2) contaminant removal and batch variability correction by applying a two-tier strategy using statistical algorithms (e.g. decontam) followed by comparison of the data structure between batches; and 3) corroborating the repeatability and reproducibility of microbiome composition and downstream statistical analysis. Using this approach on the milk microbiota data from the CHILD Cohort generated in two batches (extracted and sequenced in 2016 and 2019), we were able to identify potential reagent contaminants that were missed with standard algorithms, and substantially reduce contaminant-induced batch variability. Additionally, we confirmed the repeatability and reproducibility of our reslults in each batch before merging them for downstream analysis.

ConclusionThis study provides important insight to advance quality control efforts in low biomass microbiome research. Within-study quality control that takes advantage of the data structure (i.e. differential prevalence of contaminants between batches) would enhance the overall reliability and reproducibility of research in this field.","NA"

However, the impact these modifications have on the severity of influenza disease has not been examined. Herein, we profile the glycomic host responses to influenza virus infection as a function of disease severity using a ferret model and our lectin microarray technology. We identify the glycan epitope high mannose as a marker of influenza virus-induced pathogenesis and severity of disease outcome. Induction of high mannose is dependent upon the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, a pathway previously shown to associate with lung damage and severity of influenza virus infection. Also, the mannan-binding lectin (MBL2), an innate immune lectin that negatively impacts influenza outcomes, recognizes influenza virus-infected cells in a high mannose dependent manner. Together, our data argue that the high mannose motif is an infection-associated molecular pattern on host cells that may guide immune responses leading to the concomitant damage associated with severity.

Herein, we identify the induction of high mannose, a glycan epitope, as a key mediator of severe disease outcome.

The ability to rapidly generate genetic variation is crucial for C. albicans to adapt to changing or stress environments, like those encountered in the host. Genetic variation occurs via stress-induced mutagenesis or can be generated through its parasexual cycle, which includes mating between diploids or stress-induced mitotic defects to produce tetraploids and non-meiotic ploidy reduction. However, it remains largely unknown how genetic background contributes to C. albicans genome instability in vitro or in vivo. Here, we tested how genetic background, ploidy and host environment impact C. albicans genome stability. We found that host association induced both loss-of-heterozygosity events and genome size changes, regardless of genetic background or ploidy. However, the magnitude and types of genome changes varied across C. albicans strains. We also assessed whether host-induced genomic changes resulted in any consequences on growth rate and virulence phenotypes and found that many host derived isolates had significant changes compared to their parental strains. Interestingly, host derivatives from diploid C. albicans predominantly displayed increased virulence, whereas host derivatives from tetraploid C. albicans had mostly reduced virulence.

Here we propose to invert the fitting process by proceeding from the network dynamics towards network parameters. Firing state transitions are chosen according to the transition graph followed by an agent when solving a given behavioural task. Then, a system of linear equations is constructed from the network firing states and membrane potentials, in such a way that system consistency in guarantee. This allows to uncouple the activity features of the model, like its neurons firing rate and correlation, from the connectivity features and from the task-solving algorithm implemented by the network, allowing to fit these three levels separately.

Accounting for polysynaptic communication also significantly strengthened structure-function coupling, with the navigation and shortest paths models leading to 35-65% increases in association strength with FC. Combining behavioral and functional results into a single ranking of communication models positioned navigation as the top model, suggesting that it may more faithfully recapitulate underlying neural signaling patterns. We conclude that network communication models augment the functional and behavioral predictive utility of the human structural connectome and contribute to narrowing the gap between brain structure and function.","NA"

Here we introduce a framework that facilitates a deeper understanding of the weight dependence of temporal SNR measures in ME-fMRI.

Theory and MethodsWe examine two metrics that have been used to characterize ME-fMRI performance: temporal SNR (tSNR) and multi-echo temporal (metSNR). Both metrics can be described using the generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ) and are predicted to be relatively insensitive to the weights when there is a high degree of similarity between a metric-specific matrix in the GRQ numerator and a metricindependent covariance matrix in the GRQ denominator. The application of the GRQ framework to experimental data is demonstrated using a resting-state fMRI dataset acquired with a multi-echo multi-band EPI sequence.

ResultsIn the example dataset, similarities between the covariance matrix and the metSNR and tSNR numerator matrices are highest in grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) voxels, respectively. For representative GM and CSF voxels that exhibit high matrix similarity values, the metSNR and tSNR values, respectively, are both within 4% of their optimal values across a range of weighting schemes. However, there is a fundamental tradeoff, with a high degree of weight sensitivity in the tSNR and metSNR metrics for the representative GM and CSF voxels, respectively. Geometric insight into the observed weight dependencies is provided through a graphical interpretation of the GRQ.

ConclusionA GRQ framework can provide insight into the factors that determine the weight sensitivity of tSNR and metSNR measures in ME-fMRI.","NA"

The 2 adrenergic agonist is a unique anesthetic that generates unconsciousness selectively through 2 adrenergic receptors and related circuits. We studied intracortical neuronal dynamics during transitions of loss of consciousness (LOC) with the 2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine and return of consciousness (ROC) in a functionally interconnecting somatosensory and ventral premotor network in non-human primates. LOC, ROC and full task performance recovery were all associated with distinct neural changes. The early recovery demonstrated characteristic intermediate dynamics distinguished by sustained high spindle activities. Awakening by the 2 adrenergic antagonist completely eliminated this intermediate state and instantaneously restored awake dynamics and the top task performance while the anesthetic was still being infused. The results suggest that instantaneous functional recovery is possible following anesthetic-induced unconsciousness and the intermediate recovery state is not a necessary path for the brain recovery.","NA"

During error trials, paths coded by place cell sequences were significantly shorter as rats approached incorrect stop locations, with place cell sequences starting at a significantly delayed phase of the theta cycle. During rest, place cell sequences replayed representations of paths that were highly likely to end at the correct reward location during correct but not error trials. The relationship between place cell sequences and gamma rhythms, however, did not differ between correct and error trials.

The intestines of these patients are macroscopically normal, but lack enteroendocrine cells (EECs), suggesting an essential role for this rare population of nutrient-sensing cells in regulating macronutrient absorption. We used human and mouse models of EEC deficiency to identify a new role for the EEC hormone peptide YY in regulating ion-coupled absorption of glucose and dipeptides the small intestine. We found that peptide YY is required in to maintain normal electrophysiology in the presence of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, a potent stimulator of ion secretion produced by enteric neurons. Administration of peptide YY to EEC-deficient mice restored normal electrophysiology, improved glucose and peptide absorption, diminished diarrhea and rescued postnatal survival.

Comparative studies of variation in cognitive skills allow testing of evolutionary hypotheses addressing socioecological factors driving the evolution of primate brain size. However, data on cognitive abilities for meaningful interspecific comparisons are only available for haplorhine primates (great apes, Old- and New World monkeys) although strepsirrhine primates (lemurs and lorises) serve as the best living models of ancestral primate cognitive skills, linking primates to other mammals. To begin filling this gap, we tested members of three lemur species (Microcebus murinus, Varecia variegata, Lemur catta) with the Primate Cognition Test Battery, a comprehensive set of experiments addressing physical and social cognitive skills that has previously been used in studies of haplorhines. We found no significant differences in cognitive performance among lemur species and, surprisingly, their average performance was not different from that of haplorhines in many aspects. Specifically, lemurs overall performance was inferior in the physical domain but matched that of haplorhines in the social domain.

However, contradicting in vitro suggest a different view on physiological and clinical significance of FSHR-mediated cAMP signaling. We found that the G protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) heteromerizes with FSHR, reprogramming cAMP/death signals into proliferative stimuli fundamental for sustaining oocyte survival. In human granulosa cells, survival signals are effectively delivered upon equal expression levels of both receptors, while they are missing at high FSHR:GPER ratio, which negatively impacts follicle maturation and strongly correlates with FSH responsiveness of patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. Consistent with high FSHR expression levels during follicular selection, cell viability is dramatically reduced in FSHR overexpressing cells due to preferential coupling to the Gs protein/cAMP pathway. In contrast, FSHR/GPER heteromer formation resulted in FSH-triggered anti-apoptotic/proliferative signaling delivered via the G{beta}{gamma} dimer while heteromer impairment or GPER-associated Gs inhibitory protein complexes resulted in cell death. GPER-depleted granulosa cells have an amplified FSH-dependent decrease in cell viability and steroidogenesis, consistent with the requirement of estrogen signaling for successful oocyte growth. Therefore, our findings indicate how oocyte maturation depends on the capability of GPER to shape FSHR selective signals, indicating hormone receptor heteromers may be a marker of cell proliferation.

In this study, we used population genetics analysis to infer the mutation rate and plausible recombination events that may have contributed to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, we localized targets of recent and strong positive selection. The genomic regions that appear to be under positive selection are largely co-localized with regions in which recombination from non-human hosts appeared to have taken place in the past. Our results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome. However, we find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus genomes from other hosts, i.e., Hedgehog and Sparrow. Even though recombination events within human hosts cannot be directly assessed, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we infer that recombinations may have recently occurred within human hosts using a linkage disequilibrium analysis. In addition, we employed an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the SARS-CoV-2 populations that have infected European, Asian and Northern American cohorts, and we demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth in population size can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","NA"

Here, we apply concepts from ecological theory to understand how biotic and abiotic factors affect interaction patterns between the two opportunistic human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphyloccocus aureus, which often co-occur in polymicrobial infections. Specifically, we conducted a series of short- and long-term competition experiments between P. aeruginosa PAO1 (as our reference strain) and three different S. aureus strains (Cowan I, 6850, JE2) at three different starting frequencies and under three different environmental (culturing) conditions. We found that the competitive ability of P. aeruginosa strongly depended on the strain background of S. aureus, whereby P. aeruginosa dominated against Cowan I and 6850, but not against JE2. In the latter case, both species could end up as winners depending on conditions. Specifically, we observed strong frequency-dependent fitness patterns, including positive frequency dependence, where P. aeruginosa could dominate JE2 only when common, but not when rare. Finally, changes in environmental (culturing) conditions fundamentally altered the competitive balance between the two species, in a way that P. aeruginosa dominance increased when moving from shaken to static environments. Altogether, our results highlight that ecological details can have profound effects on the competitive dynamics between co-infecting pathogens, and determine whether two species can co-exist or invade each others populations from rare. Moreover, our findings might parallel certain dynamics observed in chronic polymicrobial infections.

ImportanceBacterial infections are frequently caused by more than one species and such polymicrobial infections are often considered more virulent and more difficult to treat than the respective monospecies infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphyloccocus aureus are among the most important pathogens in polymicrobial infections and their co-occurrence is linked to worse disease outcome. There is great interest in understanding how these two species interact with each other and what the consequences for the host are. While previous studies have mainly looked at molecular mechanisms implicated in interactions between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, here we show that ecological factors such as strain background, strain frequency and environmental conditions are important elements determining population dynamics and species co-existence patterns. We propose that the uncovered principles may also play major roles in infections, and therefore proclaim that an integrative approach combining molecular and ecological aspects is required to fully understand polymicrobial infections.","NA"

Research into natural antimicrobials could provide candidates to fill the antibiotic discovery gap, and the study of plants and other natural materials used in historical infection remedies may enable further discoveries of natural products with useful antimicrobial activity. We previously reconstructed a 1,000-year-old remedy containing onion, garlic, wine, and bile salts, which is known as  Balds eyesalve, and showed it to have promising antibacterial activity. In this paper, we have found this remedy has bactericidal activity against a range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive wound pathogens in planktonic culture and, crucially, that this activity is maintained against Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes in a model of soft-tissue wound biofilm. While the presence of garlic in the mixture is sufficient to explain activity against planktonic cultures, garlic alone has no activity against biofilms. We have found the potent anti-biofilm activity of Balds eyesalve cannot be attributed to a single ingredient and requires the combination of all ingredients to achieve full activity. Our work highlights the need to explore not only single compounds but also mixtures of natural products for treating biofilm infections. These results also underline the importance of working with biofilm models when exploring natural products for the anti-biofilm pipeline.

ImportanceBacteria can live in two ways, as individual planktonic cells or as a multicellular biofilm. Biofilm helps protect bacteria from antibiotics and makes them much harder to treat. Both the biofilm lifestyle and the evolution of antibiotic resistance mean we urgently need new drugs to treat infections. Here, we show that a medieval remedy made from onion, garlic, wine, and bile can kill a range of problematic bacteria grown both planktonically and as biofilms. A single component of the remedy - allicin, derived from garlic - is sufficient to kill planktonic bacteria. However, garlic or allicin alone do nothing against bacteria when they form a biofilm. All four ingredients are needed to fully kill bacterial biofilm communities, hinting that these ingredients work together to kill the bacteria. This suggests that future discovery of antibiotics from natural products could be enhanced by studying combinations of ingredients, rather than single plants or compounds.","NA"

Hence, we devised an object selection task in a virtual reality environment to test how the velocity of hand movements impact a number of brain responses. From a series of analyses of EEG recordings synchronized with motion capture, we found that the velocity of the participants hand movements modulated the brains proprioception during the task and induced prediction error negativity.

The most effective experimental therapy against the EBOV is the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this work, we describe the development of HEK293T cells engineered for the transient and stable expression of mAb13C6, a neutralizing anti-EBOV monoclonal antibody. We transfected the HEK293T cells with a tricistronic vector to produce the heavy and the light chain of the antibody 13C6 and intracellular Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) using Lipofectamine 3000. We then selected the transfected cells using puromycin pressure, dilution cloning, and cloning disks. This integrated strategy generated mAb-producing cells in 7 days with a transient expression of [~]1 mg/L. Stable pools were produced after 4 weeks, with expression levels of [~]0.8 mg/L. Stable clones with expression levels of [~]1.8 mg/L were obtained within 10 weeks. The produced antibodies exhibited the expected functionality; they recognized the GP glycoprotein of the Ebola virus in both ELISA assays and cell binding experiments using HEK293T cells engineered to express the EBOV GP at their membrane surface. By the combined use of GFP and the set of selection techniques here described, we drastically reduced the time from transfection to stable clone generation without resorting to costly equipment. In outbreaks or emergencies, this platform can significantly shorten the development of new biopharmaceuticals and vaccines.","NA"

Our library design allows fitness within the pool to be assessed by a one-step PCR reaction directly followed by Illumina sequencing (CRISPRi-seq). The doxycycline-inducible CRISPRi system is tightly controllable and suitable for both bottleneck exploration and evaluation of gene fitness in vitro and in vivo. Here, we applied CRISPRi-seq to identify genetic factors important for causing pneumococcal pneumonia. Mice were infected intratracheally with our CRISPRi library and bacteria collected at 24 h (from lung) and 48 h (from both lung and blood) post-infection. CRISPRi-seq showed a critical bottleneck at 48 h after intratracheal infection, with only a few bacteria surviving the brunt of the innate immune response to cause systemic infection. However, earlier at 24 h post-infection, many significant differences in gene fitness cost between in vitro and in vivo conditions were identified, including genes encoding known and putative novel virulence factors, genes essential only in vivo, and genes essential only in vitro. A key advantage of CRISPRi-seq over traditional transposon-based genetic screens is that all genes, including essential genes, can be tested for their role in virulence and pathogenicity. The approaches developed here should be generally applicable to study infection bottlenecks and in vivo fitness for other important human and animal pathogens.","NA"

When integrated, RNA and DNA allele frequencies can reveal patterns characteristic of a wide-range of biological traits, including ploidy changes, genome admixture, allele-specific expression and gene-dosage transcriptional response.

ResultsTo assess RNA and DNA allele frequencies from matched sequencing datasets, we introduce a method for generating model distributions of variant allele frequencies (VAF) with a given variant read probability. In contrast to other methods, based on whole sequences or single SNV, proposed methodology uses continuous multi-SNV genomic regions. The methodology is implemented in a GeTallele toolbox that provides a suite of functions for integrative analysis, statistical assessment and visualization of Genome and Transcriptome allele frequencies. Using model VAF probabilities, GeTallele allows estimation and comparison of variant read probabilities (VAF distributions) in a sequencing dataset. We demonstrate this functionality across cancer DNA and RNA sequencing datasets.

ConclusionBased on our evaluation, variant read probabilities can serve as a dependable indicator to assess gene and chromosomal allele asymmetries and to aid calls of genomic events in matched sequencing RNA and DNA datasets.

To help decipher its underlying mechanism and understand its impact, it is desirable to comprehensively profile 3-untranslated region cleavage and associated polyadenylation sites. State-of-the-art polyadenylation site detection tools are known to be influenced by library preparation artefacts or manually selected features. Moreover, recently published machine learning methods have only been tested on pre-constructed datasets, thus lacking validation on experimental data. Here we present Terminitor, the first deep neural network-based profiling pipeline to make predictions from RNA-seq data. We show how Terminitor outperforms competing tools in sensitivity and precision on experimental transcriptome sequencing data, and demonstrate its use with data from short- and long-read sequencing technologies. For species without a good reference transcriptome annotation, Terminitor is still able to pass on the information learnt from a related species and make reasonable predictions. We used Terminitor to showcase how single nucleotide variations can create or destroy polyadenylated cleavage sites in human RNA-seq samples.

Author Summary3 cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA is part of RNA maturation process. One gene can be cleaved at different positions at its 3 end, namely alternatively polyadenylation, thus identifying the correct polyadenylated cleavage site (poly(A) CS) is essential to unveil its role in gene regulation under different physiological and pathological conditions. The current poly(A) CS prediction tools are either heavily influenced by RNA-Seq library preparation artefacts or have only been designed and tested on ad hoc datasets, lacking association with real world applications. In this study, we present a deep learning model, Terminitor, that predicts the probability of a nucleotide sequence containing a poly(A) CS, and validated its performance on human and mouse data. Along with the model, we propose a poly(A) CS profiling pipeline for RNA-seq data. We benchmarked our pipeline against competing tools and achieved higher sensitivity and precision in experimental data. The usage of Terminitor is not limited to genome and transcriptome annotation and we expect it to facilitate the identification of novel isoforms, improve the accuracy of transcript quantification and differential expression analysis, and contribute to the repertoire of reference transcriptome annotation.","NA"

Previous work proposed that a chromosome-derived Ran-GTP gradient promotes spindle assembly around chromosomes by liberating spindle assembly factors (SAFs) from inhibitory importins. However, Rans dual functions in interphase nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitotic spindle assembly have made it difficult to assess its mitotic roles in somatic cells. Here, using auxin-inducible degron technology in human cells, we developed acute mitotic degradation assays to dissect Rans mitotic roles systematically and separately from its interphase function. In contrast to the prevailing model, we found that the Ran pathway is not essential for spindle assembly activities that occur at sites spatially separated from chromosomes, including activating NuMA for spindle pole focusing or for targeting TPX2. In contrast, Ran-GTP is required to localize HURP and HSET specifically at chromosome-proximal regions. We demonstrated that Ran-GTP and importin-{beta} coordinately promote HURPs dynamic microtubule binding-dissociation cycle near chromosomes, which results in stable kinetochore-fiber formation. Intriguingly, this pathway acts to establish proper spindle length preferentially during prometaphase, rather than metaphase. Together, we propose that the Ran pathway is required to activate SAFs specifically near chromosomes, but not generally during human mitotic spindle assembly. Ran-dependent spindle assembly is likely coupled with parallel pathways to activate SAFs, including NuMA, for spindle pole focusing away from chromosomes.

Even though organisms employ powerful mechanisms to demobilize TEs, transposons gradually lose repression during aging. The rising TE activity causes genomic instability and was implicated in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation and the determination of lifespan. It is therefore conceivable that long-lived individuals have improved TE silencing mechanisms resulting in reduced TE expression relative to their shorter-lived counterparts and fewer genomic insertions. Here, we test this hypothesis by performing the first genome-wide analysis of TE insertions and expression in populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for longevity through late-life reproduction for 50-170 generations from four independent studies. Contrary to our expectation, TE families were generally more abundant in long-lived populations compared to non-selected controls. Although simulations showed that this was not expected under neutrality, we found little evidence for selection driving TE abundance differences. Additional RNA-seq analysis revealed a tendency for reducing TE expression in selected populations, which might be more important for lifespan than regulating genomic insertions. We further find limited evidence of parallel selection on genes related to TE regulation and transposition. However, telomeric TEs were genomically and transcriptionally more abundant in long-lived flies, suggesting improved telomere maintenance as a promising TE-mediated mechanism for prolonging lifespan. Our results provide a novel viewpoint indicating that reproduction at old age increases the opportunity of TEs to be passed on to the next generation with little impact on longevity.","NA"

Here we present a simplified method for inserting point mutations into BAC transgenes requiring a single recombineering step followed by antibiotic selection. This technique, which we call ESI (Exogenous/Synthetic Intronization) mutagenesis, relies on co-integration of a mutation of interest along with a selectable marker gene, the latter of which is harboured in an artificial intron adjacent to the mutation site. Cell lines generated from ESI-mutated BACs express the transgenes equivalently to the endogenous gene, and all cells efficiently splice out the synthetic intron.

To address if this phenotype is driven by CVT tissue-residence, we used a mouse model to control for environmental factors. Using localized and systemic infection models, we found that CD8 TRM in the mouse CVT gradually acquired a granzyme B+, TCF-1- phenotype as seen in human CVT. In contrast to CD8 TRM in the gut, these CD8 TRM were not stably maintained regardless of the initial infection route, which led to reductions in local immunity. Our data show that residence in the CVT is sufficient to progressively shape the size and function of its CD8 TRM compartment.

SummaryThe tissue-resident memory (TRM) CD8 T cell compartment in human and mouse cervicovaginal tissue (CVT) is remarkably similar. The CVT TRM compartment is maintained autonomously and does not reach phenoypical or numerical equilibrium. The numerical decline leads to impaired viral control in a secondary challenge.","NA"

We previously showed that GBP1 mediates atypical apoptosis or pyroptosis of human macrophages infected with Toxoplasma gondii (Tg) or Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (STm), respectively. In mice, the p47 Immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) control the recruitment of GBPs to microbe-containing vacuoles and subsequent cell death. However, humans are devoid of functional IRGs, and the pathogen-proximal immune detection mechanisms by GBP1 are poorly understood. Here, we describe two novel single-cell assays which show that GBP1 promotes the lysis of Tg-containing vacuoles and Tg plasma membrane, resulting in the cytosolic detection of Tg-DNA. In contrast, we show GBP1 only targets cytosolic STm and does not contribute to bacterial escape into the cytosol of human macrophages. GBP1 interacts with caspase-4 and recruits it directly to the bacterial surface, where caspase-4 can be activated by LPS. During STm infection, caspase-1 cleaves and inactivates GBP1 at Asp192, a site conserved in related mammalian GBP1 proteins but not in murine Gbps. STm-infected human macrophages expressing a cleavage-deficient GBP1 mutant exhibit higher pyroptosis due to the absence of caspase-1-mediated feedback inhibition of the GBP1-caspase-4 pathway.

The tumor-promoting biology of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) make them a target for novel therapies. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) have been shown to regulate the activated fibroblast phenotype in benign disease. We investigated the potential for CAF modulation in EAC using PDE5i to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy.

MethodsEAC fibroblasts were treated with PDE5i and phenotypic effects examined using immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, gel contraction, transwell invasion, organotypics, single cell RNAseq and shotgun proteomics. The combination of PDE5i with standard-of-care chemotherapy (Epirubicin, 5-Fluorouracil and Cisplatin) was tested for safety and efficacy in validated near-patient model systems (3D tumor growth assays (3D-TGAs) and patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models).

ResultsPDE5i treatment reduced -SMA expression in CAFs by 50% (p<0.05), associated with a significant reduction in the ability of CAFs to contract collagen-1 gels and induce cancer cell invasion, (p<0.05). RNAseq and proteomic analysis of CAF and EAC cell lines revealed PDE5i specific regulation of pathways related to fibroblast activation and tumor promotion. 3D-TGA assays confirmed the importance of stromal cells to chemoresistance in EAC, which could be attenuated by PDE5i. Chemotherapy+PDE5i in PDX-bearing mice was safe and significantly reduced PDX tumor volume (p<0.05).

Exploiting a natural experiment of cyclical seasonal variation including changes in diet and nutritional status in rural Gambia, we replicated 125 loci with a common season-of-conception methylation signature in two independent child cohorts, providing evidence of environmental effects on DNA methylation in the early embryo that persist at least until mid-childhood. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these loci were highly enriched for metastable epialleles, parent-of-origin specific methylation and regions hypomethylated in sperm, and for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks in multiple tissues. They tended to co-locate with endogenous retroviral (ERV1, ERVK) elements. Identified loci were influenced but not determined by measured genetic variation, notably through gene-environment interactions. To the extent that early methylation changes impact gene expression, environmental sensitivity during early embryo genomic remethylation could thus constitute a sense-record-adapt mechanism linking early environment to later phenotype.","NA"

Here we asked how the brain representation of semantic categories is shaped by the depth of processing during mental simulation. Participants were presented with visual words during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During shallow processing, participants had to read the items. During deep processing, they had to mentally simulate the features associated with the words. Multivariate classification, informational connectivity and encoding models were used to reveal how the depth of processing determines the brain representation of word meaning. Decoding accuracy in putative substrates of the semantic network was enhanced when the depth processing was high, and the brain representations were more generalizable in semantic space relative to shallow processing contexts. This pattern was observed even in association areas in inferior frontal and parietal cortex. Deep information processing during mental simulation also increased the informational connectivity within key substrates of the semantic network. To further examine the properties of the words encoded in brain activity, we compared computer vision models - associated with the image referents of the words - and word embedding. Computer vision models explained more variance of the brain responses across multiple areas of the semantic network. These results indicate that the brain representation of word meaning is highly malleable by the depth of processing imposed by the task, relies on access to visual representations and is highly distributed, including prefrontal areas previously implicated in semantic control.","NA"

Previous studies in AD mouse models suggested that physical exercise or changed lifestyle can delay AD related synaptic and memory dysfunctions when treatment started in juvenile animals long before onset of disease symptoms. Here, we addressed whether the FDA approved drug fingolimod rescues AD related synaptic deficits and memory dysfunction in an APP/PS1 AD mouse model when medication starts after onset of symptoms (at 5 months). Male mice received intraperitoneal injections of fingolimod for 1-2 months starting at 5-6 months. This treatment rescued spine density as well as long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, and ameliorated dysfunctional hippocampus-dependent memory that was observed in untreated APP/PS1 animals at 6-7 months of age. Immunohistochemical analysis with markers of microgliosis (Iba1) and astrogliosis (GFAP) revealed that our fingolimod treatment regime strongly down regulated neuro-inflammation in the hippocampus and cortex of this AD model. These effects were accompanied by a moderate reduction of A{beta} accumulation in hippocampus and cortex. Our results suggest that fingolimod, when applied after onset of disease symptoms in an APP/PS1 mouse model, rescues synaptic pathology and related memory performance deficits observed in untreated AD mice, and that this beneficial effect is mediated via anti-neuroinflammatory actions of the drug on microglia and astrocytes.","NA"

While the reasons are unclear, relevant factors include the intensity of within-versus between-group selection that are likely to have shaped the course of life cycle evolution. A highly structured environment eliminates the possibility of mixing between evolving lineages, thus ensuring strong competition between groups. Less structure intensifies competition within groups, decreasing opportunity for group-level evolution. Here, using populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, we report the results of experiments that explore the effect of lineage mixing on the evolution of nascent multicellular groups. Groups were propagated under regimes requiring reproduction via a life cycle replete with developmental and dispersal (propagule) phases, but in one treatment lineages never mixed, whereas in a second treatment, cells from different lineages experienced intense competition during the dispersal phase. The latter treatment favoured traits promoting cell growth at the expense of traits underlying group fitness - a finding that is supported by results from a mathematical model. Together our results show that the transition to multicellularity benefits from ecological conditions that maintain discreteness not just of the group (soma) phase, but also of the dispersal (germline) phase.","NA"

The chromosomal structures obtained in silico are quantitatively consistent with those obtained through super-resolution microscopy as well as DNA-DNA proximity ligation assays. Theory predicts that chromosome structures are fluid and can only be described by an ensemble, which is consistent with the observation that chromosomes exhibit no unique fold. Nevertheless, our analysis of both structures from simulation and super-resolution microscopy reveals that short segments of chromatin make transitions between a closed conformation and an open dumbbell conformation. This conformational transition appears to be consistent with a two-state process with an effective free energy cost of about four times the effective information theoretic temperature. Finally, we study the conformational changes associated with the switching of genomic compartments observed in human cell lines. Genetically identical but epigenetically distinct cell types appear to rearrange their respective structural ensembles to expose segments of transcriptionally active chromatin, belonging to the A genomic compartment, towards the surface of the chromosome, while inactive segments, belonging to the B compartment, move to the interior. The formation of genomic compartments resembles hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, with the aggregation of denser and predominantly inactive chromatin driving the positioning of active chromatin toward the surface of individual chromosomal territories.","NA"

Previous studies have demonstrated that decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) scaffolds can provide a pro-adipogenic microenvironment, and that seeding with adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) can enhance in vivo angiogenesis and adipogenesis within DAT implants. Recognizing that bioreactor systems can promote cell expansion and infiltration on tissue-engineered scaffolds, this study evaluated the effects of culturing human ASCs on DAT scaffolds within a perfusion bioreactor. Using this system, the impact of both shear stress stimulation and hypoxic preconditioning were explored in vitro and in vivo. Initial studies compared the effects of 14 days of culture within the perfusion bioreactor under 2% O2 or ~20% O2 on human ASC expansion and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1) expression in vitro relative to static cultured controls. The findings indicated that culturing within the bioreactor under 2% O2 significantly increased ASC proliferation on the DAT, with a higher cell density observed in the scaffold periphery. HIF-1 expression was significantly higher when the scaffolds were cultured under 2% O2. Subsequent characterization in a subcutaneous implant model in athymic nude mice revealed that in vivo angiogenesis and adipogenesis were markedly enhanced when the ASCs were cultured on the DAT within the perfusion bioreactor under 2% O2 for 14 days prior to implantation relative to the other culture conditions, as well as additional freshly-seeded and unseeded DAT control groups. Overall, dynamic culture within the perfusion bioreactor system under hypoxia represents a promising approach for preconditioning ASCs on DAT scaffolds to enhance their capacity to stimulate blood vessel formation and infiltration, as well as host-derived adipose tissue regeneration.","NA"

If true it has fundamental consequences for our understanding of the regulation of biological functions during an action potential. It has long been known that the electrical dipoles in the neuronal membrane reorient during an action potential, observed through a variety of optical methods. However, this information has been insufficient to confirm if and how the collective thermodynamic state of the neuronal membrane changes during an action potential. Here, we show that hyperspectral stimulated Raman spectroscopy can resolve the thermodynamic state of the neuronal membranes in a single neuron during an action potential. Based on these measurements we provide the first evidence that the system condenses during the de-polarisation phase and melts during the polarisation phase.

Statement of SignificanceWhile action-potentials can be measured using a variety of methods, none of these methods have been able to provide sufficient information to characterise the collective thermodynamic state of the membrane during an action-potential. Therefore, new tools are required to satisfactorily resolve the fundamental nature of the phenomenon, i.e. does the wave-front propagates irreversibly/diffusively as in the burning of a fuse, or reversibly/elastically as in the propagation of sound. It has been postulated that if action-potentials indeed propagate elastically, then the membrane must undergo a localised condensation during the action-potential. This article confirms and quantifies the condensation of the membrane during an action-potential based on time-resolved changes in the Raman band at 2930 cm-1, also known as the ""melting-marker"".","NA"

How membrane bending is accomplished is not yet fully understood but has been linked to the simultaneous binding of the pentameric B-subunit to multiple copies of their glycosphingolipid receptors. Here, we probe the toxin membrane binding and internalization mechanisms by using a combination of super-resolution and polarized localization microscopy. We show that cholera toxin subunit B (CTxB) can induce membrane curvature only when bound to multiple copies of its glycosphingolipid receptor, GM1, and the ceramide structure of GM1 is likely not a determinant of this activity as assessed in model membranes. A mutant CTxB capable of binding only a single GM1 fails to generate curvature either in model membranes or in cells and clustering the mutant CTxB-single-GM1 complexes by antibody cross-linking does not rescue the membrane curvature phenotype. We conclude that both the multiplicity and specific geometry of GM1 binding sites are necessary for the induction of membrane curvature. We expect this to be a general rule of membrane behavior for all AB5 toxins and polyomaviruses that bind glycosphingolipids to invade host cells.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMembrane binding toxins demonstrate both a public health challenge and a bioengineering opportunity due to their efficient internalization into cells. These toxins multivalently bind to naturally occurring lipid receptors at the plasma membrane and initiate endocytosis. This manuscript reports the importance of structured lipid-receptor clustering for the induction of membrane bending. We also observed that the magnitude of membrane curvature was correlated to the stoichiometry of toxin-bound receptors. By identifying how these bacterial proteins initiate membrane curvature, these findings provide mechanistic insights into the early steps of pathogenic endocytosis.","NA"

Around the same time, David Tilman demonstrated that increased nutrient loading would also be expected to cause competitive exclusion leading to deleterious changes in food web diversity. While both concepts have greatly illuminated general diversity-stability theory, we currently lack a coherent framework to predict how nutrients influence food web stability across a landscape. This is a vitally important gap in our understanding, given mounting evidence of serious ecological disruption arising from anthropogenic displacement of resources and organisms. Here, we combine contemporary theory on food webs and meta-ecosystems to show that nutrient additions are indeed expected to drive loss in stability and function in human-impacted regions. However, this loss in stability occurs not just from wild oscillations in population abundance, but more frequently from the complete loss of an equilibrium due to edible plant species being competitively excluded. In highly modified landscapes, spatial nutrient transport theory suggests that such instabilities can be amplified over vast distances from the sites of nutrient addition. Consistent with this theoretical synthesis, the empirical frequency of these distant propagating ecosystem imbalances appears to be growing. This synthesis of theory and empirical data suggests that human modification of the Earths ecological connectivity is ""entangling"" once distantly separated ecosystems, causing rapid, expansive, and costly nutrient-driven instabilities over vast areas of the planet. The corollary to this spatial nutrient theory, though -- akin to weak interaction theory from food web networks -- is that slow spatial nutrient pathways can be potent stabilizers by moderating flows across a landscape.","NA"

In these studies, we used a model that implements enrichment of HLM samples with CYP2E1 through membrane incorporation of the purified protein. Enrichment of HLM with CYP2E1 considerably increases the rate of metabolism of 7-benzyloxyquinoline (BQ) and attenuates the homotropic cooperativity observed with this CYP3A4-specific substrate. Incorporation of CYP2E1 also eliminates the activating effect of -Naphthoflavone (ANF) on BQ metabolism seen in some untreated HLM samples. To probe the physiological relevance of these effects, we compared three pulled preparations of HLM from normal donors (HLM-N) with a preparation obtained from heavy alcohol consumers (HLM-A). The composition of the P450 pool in all four samples was characterized by the mass-spectrometric determination of 11 cytochrome P450 species. The molar content of CYP2E1 in HLM-A was from 2.5 to 3.3 times higher than that found in HLM-N. In contrast, the content of CYP3A4 in HLM-A was the lowest among all four HLM samples. Despite that, HLM-A exhibited a much higher rate of metabolism and a lower degree of homotropic cooperativity with BQ, similar to that observed in CYP2E1-enriched HLM-N. To substantiate the hypothesis on the involvement of physical interactions between CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in the observed effects, we probed hetero-association of these proteins in Supersomes containing recombinant CYP3A4 with a technique based on homo-FRET and employing CYP2E1 labeled with BODIPY-618 maleimide. These experiments demonstrated high-affinity interactions between the two enzymes and revealed an inhibitory effect of ANF on their hetero-association. Our results demonstrate that the catalytic activity and allosteric properties of CYP3A4 are fundamentally dependent on the composition of the cytochrome P450 ensemble and imply a profound impact of chronic alcohol exposure on the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.","NA"

New human relevant models of the airways are urgently needed to understand how respiratory infections may trigger asthma attacks, and to advance treatment development.

ObjectivesTo develop a new human relevant model of rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbation that recapitulates viral infection of asthmatic airway epithelium, neutrophil transepithelial migration, and enables evaluation of immunomodulatory therapy.

MethodsA micro-engineered model of fully differentiated human mucociliary airway epithelium was stimulated with IL-13 to induce a Th2-type asthmatic phenotype and infected with live human rhinovirus 16 (HRV16) to reproduce key features of viral-induced asthma exacerbation.

Measurements and Main ResultsInfection with HRV16 replicated key hallmarks of the cytopathology and inflammatory responses observed in human airways. Generation of a Th2 microenvironment through exogenous IL-13 stimulation induced features of asthmatics airways, including goblet cell hyperplasia, reduction of cilia beating frequency, and endothelial activation, but did not alter rhinovirus infectivity or replication. High resolution kinetic analysis of secreted inflammatory markers revealed that IL-13 treatment altered the IL-6, IFN-{lambda}1, and CXCL10 secretion in response to HRV16. Neutrophil transepithelial migration was greatest when viral infection was combined with IL-13 treatment, while treatment with MK-7123, a CXCR2 antagonist, reduced neutrophil diapedesis in all conditions.

ConclusionsThis micro-engineered Airway Lung-Chip provides a novel human-relevant platform for exploring the complex mechanisms underlying viral-induced asthma exacerbation. Our data suggest that IL-13 may impair the hosts ability to mount an appropriate and coordinated immune response to rhinovirus infection. We also show that the Airway Lung-Chip can be used to assess the efficacy of modulators of the immune response.

At a Glance CommentaryO_ST_ABSScientific Knowledge on the SubjectC_ST_ABSNew therapies for asthma exacerbations remain a significant unmet medical need. Development of human relevant preclinical models are needed to further elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbation and investigate new therapeutic strategies.

What This Study Adds to the FieldUsing a human Airway Lung-Chip model, we show here for the first time a live human rhinovirus (HRV) infection of the asthmatic epithelium that recapitulates complex features of viral-induced asthma exacerbation. The dynamic microenvironment of the chip enables the real-time study of virus infection, epithelial response, and immune cell recruitment under healthy and asthmatic conditions. The model reproduces key endpoints that have been observed in asthmatics and individuals infected with rhinovirus including the ciliated cell sloughing, altered cilia beating frequency, goblet cell hyperplasia, increased expression of adhesion molecules in microvascular endothelial cells, and inflammatory mediator release. High-resolution temporal analysis of secreted inflammatory markers enabled by dynamic sampling revealed alteration of IL-6, IFN-{lambda}1 and CXCL10 secretory phases after rhinovirus infection in an IL-13 high environment. Leveraging high-content imaging and analysis of circulating inflammatory cells, we demonstrated the efficacy of a CXCR2 antagonist to reduce adhesion, motility, and transmigration of perfused human neutrophils. Thus, this micro-engineered chip may offer a powerful addition to preclinical models for understanding mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbation pathology and developing new therapeutic strategies.","NA"

Importantly, it has become an indispensable strategy to overcome resistance in antibiotics, anti-microbials, and anti-cancer drugs. Facing enormous chemical space and unclear design principles for small-molecule combinations, computational drug-combination design has not seen generative models to meet its potential to accelerate resistance-overcoming drug combination discovery.

ResultsWe have developed the first deep generative model for drug combination design, by jointly embedding graph-structured domain knowledge and iteratively training a reinforcement learning-based chemical graph-set designer. First, we have developed Hierarchical Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (HVGAE) trained end-to-end to jointly embed gene-gene, gene-disease, and disease-disease networks. Novel attentional pooling is introduced here for learning disease-representations from associated genes representations. Second, targeting diseases in learned representations, we have recast the drug-combination design problem as graph-set generation and developed a deep learning-based model with novel rewards. Specifically, besides chemical validity rewards, we have introduced novel generative adversarial award, being generalized sliced Wasserstein, for chemically diverse molecules with distributions similar to known drugs. We have also designed a network principle-based reward for drug combinations. Numerical results indicate that, compared to state-of-the-art graph embedding methods, HVGAE learns more informative and generalizable disease representations. Results also show that the deep generative models generate drug combinations following the principle across diseases. Case studies on four diseases show that network-principled drug combinations tend to have low toxicity. The generated drug combinations collectively cover the disease module similar to FDA-approved drug combinations and could potentially suggest novel systems-pharmacology strategies. Our method allows for examining and following network-based principle or hypothesis to efficiently generate disease-specific drug combinations in a vast chemical combinatorial space.

Using the concept of network diffusion, MicrobioLink can analyse how microbial proteins in a certain context are influencing cellular processes by modulating gene or protein expression. We demonstrated the applicability of the pipeline using a case study. We used gut metaproteomic data from Crohns disease patients and healthy controls to uncover the mechanisms by which the microbial proteins can modulate host genes which belong to biological processes implicated in disease pathogenesis. MicrobioLink, which is agnostic of the microbial protein sources (bacterial, viral etc), is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/korcsmarosgroup/HMIpipeline).","NA"

Parallel to this growth, the need for developing data mining strategies has not met sufficiently. Bioinformaticians utilize different data mining techniques to obtain the required information they need from genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic databases to construct a gene regulatory network (GRN). One of the simplest mining approaches to configure a large network (for instance, a network with 50 nodes and 200 edges) is reading a great number of papers which takes a lot of time and energy. Here we introduce an integrative method that combines information from transcriptomic data with sets of constructed pathways. A program was written in R that makes pathways from edgelists in different signaling databases. Furthermore, we explained how to distinguish false pathways from the correct ones using either literature study or a combination of biological information with gene expression results. This approach can help bioinformaticians and mathematical biologists who work with GRNs when they want to infer causal relationships between components of a biological system. Once you know which direction to go, you will reduce the number of false results.","NA"

Male genitalia are usually extremely divergent between closely related species, but relatively constant within one species. Under the lock-and-key hypothesis, rapid morphological evolution is associated with a high match between male and female genitalia of the same species and a low match between male and females of closely related species. Previous studies have suggested plasticity of genitalia to be a proof against the lock-and-key hypothesis since the environmentally triggered phenotypic change could modify the ""key"". Here we examine the effect of temperature on the shape of the ventral branches, a male genital structure involved in reproductive isolation, in the sister species Drosophila santomea and D. yakuba. We designed a semi-automatic measurement pipeline that can reliably identify curvatures and landmarks based on manually digitized contours of the ventral branches. With this method, we observed that ventral branches are not plastic in D. yakuba but that in D. santomea temperature change phenocopies interspecific genetic variation between both species for ventral branches shape. Our results suggest that speciation of D. santomea and D. yakuba was associated with a gain of plasticity and that genitalia plasticity can be compatible with the lock-and-key hypothesis.","NA"

We define such sets of traits that evolve in concert and contribute to the success of invasive populations as an  invasion syndrome. The invasive Harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis displays such an invasion syndrome with, for instance, females from invasive populations being larger and heavier than individuals from native populations, allocating more resources to reproduction, and spreading reproduction over a longer lifespan. Invasion syndromes could emerge due to selection acting jointly and directly on a multitude of traits, or due to selection on one or a few key traits that drive correlated indirect responses in other traits. Here, we investigated the degree to which the H. axyridis invasion syndrome would emerge in response to artificial selection on either female body mass or on age at first reproduction, two traits involved in their invasion syndrome. To further explore the interaction between environmental context and evolutionary change in molding the phenotypic response, we phenotyped the individuals from the selection experiments in two environments, one with abundant food resources and one with limited resources. The two artificial selection experiments show that the number of traits showing a correlated response depends upon the trait undergoing direct selection. Artificial selection on female body mass resulted in few correlated responses and hence poorly reproduced the invasion syndrome. In contrast, artificial selection on age at first reproduction resulted in more widespread phenotypic changes, which nevertheless corresponded only partly to the invasion syndrome. The artificial selection experiments also revealed a large impact of diet on the traits, with effects dependent on the trait considered and the selection regime. Overall, our results indicate that direct selection on multiple traits was likely necessary in the evolution of the H. axyridis invasion syndrome. Furthermore, they show the strength of using artificial selection to identify the traits that are correlated in different selective contexts, which represents a crucial first step in understanding the evolution of complex phenotypic patterns, including invasion syndromes.","NA"

The mechanisms of resistance to a particular stress are specialized and costly, then, mechanisms of resistance to other stresses can be negatively affected. However, it is also possible that at least a part of the stress resistance mechanisms is generic. With this premise we aimed to understand whether increased resistance to a cold stress can increase resistance to other types of stresses.

To address this issue, we used populations of Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) that have been selected for 57-71 generations for increased resistance to cold shock (-5{degrees}C for one hour). We subjected the selected (FSB; selected for cold shock resistance, derived from BRB population) and control FCB; cold shock control, derived from BRB population) populations to a variety of environmental stresses such as cold shock, heat shock, starvation, desiccation and bacterial infection. We found that the compared to FCB populations, FSB populations had higher resistance to heat stress in terms of adult survivorship and mating ability post cold or heat shock. Desiccation resistance was observed higher in FSB females compared to FCB females but no such difference was found in males. We observed that FSB populations had lower starvation resistance relative to FCB populations. There was no difference between FSB and FCB populations in their ability to survive post bacterial infection. Our findings suggest that resistance to heat stress and desiccation (in females) are positively correlated with increased resistance to cold shock. However, resistance to starvation was negatively correlated with increased resistance to cold shock.","NA"

This implies that methylation links chondrocyte genotype and phenotype, thus driving the functional effect. PLEC encodes plectin, a cytoskeletal protein that enables tissues to respond to mechanical forces. We sought to assess whether PLEC functional effects were cartilage specific.

MethodCartilage, fat pad, synovium and peripheral blood were collected from patients undergoing arthroplasty. PLEC CpGs were analysed for mQTLs and allelic expression imbalance (AEI) was performed. We focussed on previously reported mQTL clusters neighbouring cg19405177 and cg14598846. Plectin was knocked down in a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) line using CRISPR/Cas9 and cells phenotyped by RNA-sequencing.

ResultsNovel mQTLs were discovered in fat pad, synovium and peripheral blood at both clusters. The genotype-methylation effect of rs11780978 was stronger in cg14598846 than in cg19405177 and stronger in joint tissues than in peripheral blood. We observed AEI in synovium in the same direction as for cartilage. Knocking-down plectin impacted on pathways reported to have a role in OA, including Wnt signalling, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and immune regulation.

ConclusionsSynovium is also a target of the rs11780978 OA association functionally operating on PLEC. In fat pad, mQTLs were identified but these did not correlate with PLEC expression, suggesting the functional effect is not joint-wide. Our study highlights interplay between genetic risk, DNA methylation and gene expression in OA, and reveals clear differences between tissues from the same diseased joint.","NA"

The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is an environment-sensing transcription factor that contributes to vascular development, and has been implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. We hypothesized that AHR can affect atherosclerosis by regulating phenotypic modulation of SMC.

MethodsWe combined RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq and in-vitro assays in human coronary artery SMC (HCASMC), with single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), histology, and RNAscope in an SMC-specific lineage-tracing Ahr knockout mouse model of atherosclerosis to better understand the role of AHR in vascular disease.

ResultsGenomic studies coupled with functional assays in cultured HCASMC revealed that AHR modulates HCASMC phenotype and suppresses ossification in these cells. Lineage tracing and activity tracing studies in the mouse aortic sinus showed that the Ahr pathway is active in modulated SMC in the atherosclerotic lesion cap. Furthermore, scRNA-Seq studies of the SMC-specific Ahr knockout mice showed a significant increase in the proportion of modulated SMC expressing chondrocyte markers such as Col2a1 and Alpl, which localized to the lesion neointima. These cells, which we term ""chondromyocytes"" (CMC), were also identified in the neointima of human coronary arteries. In histological analyses, these changes manifested as larger lesion size, increased lineage-traced SMC participation in the lesion, decreased lineage-traced SMC in the lesion cap, and increased alkaline phosphatase activity in lesions in the Ahr knockout compared to wild-type mice. We propose that AHR is likely protective based on these data and inference from human genetic analyses.

ConclusionOverall, we conclude that AHR promotes maintenance of lesion cap integrity and diminishes the disease related SMC-to-CMC transition in atherosclerotic tissues.","NA"

ResultsWe present SATORI, a Self-ATtentiOn based model to predict Regulatory element Interactions. Our approach combines convolutional and recurrent layers with a self-attention mechanism that helps us capture a global view of the landscape of interactions between regulatory elements in a sequence. We evaluate our method on simulated data and three complex datasets: human TAL1-GATA1 transcription factor ChIP-Seq, DNase I Hypersensitive Sites (DHSs) in human promoters across 164 cell lines, and genome-wide DNase I-Seq and ATAC-Seq peaks across 36 arabidopsis samples. In each of the three experiments SATORI identified numerous statistically significant TF-TF interactions, many of which have been previously reported. Our method is able to detect higher numbers of these experimentally verified TF-TF interactions than the existing Feature Interaction Score, and also has the advantage of not requiring a computationally expensive post-processing step. Finally, SATORI can be used for detection of any type of feature interaction in models that use a similar attention mechanism, and is not limited to the detection of TF-TF interactions

Additionally, a subset of 253 accessions was replicated, using between two and five seeds per accession, to assess heterogeneity within these accessions. the genotypic diversity of the core is mostly captured in five genotypic clusters, which have some correspondence with botanical variety and market type. There is little genetic clustering by country of origin, reflecting peanuts rapid global dispersion in the 18th and 19th centuries. A genetic cluster associated with the hypogaea/aequatoriana/peruviana varieties, with accessions coming primarily from Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, is consistent with these having been the earliest landraces. The genetics, phenotypic characteristics, and biogeography are all consistent with previous reports of tetraploid peanut originating in Southeast Bolivia. Analysis of the genotype data indicates an early genetic radiation, followed by regional distribution of major genetic classes through South America, and then a global dissemination that retains much of the early genetic diversity in peanut. Comparison of the genotypic data relative to alleles from the diploid progenitors also indicates that subgenome exchanges, both large and small, have been major contributors to the genetic diversity in peanut.

We used cryo-electron tomography and focused ion beam milling of native bacterial biofilms to image cellulose-synthesizing G. hansenii and G. xylinus bacteria in a frozen-hydrated, near-native state. We confirm previous results suggesting that cellulose crystallization occurs serially following its secretion along one side of the cell, leading to a cellulose ribbon that can reach several microns in length and combine with ribbons from other cells to form a robust biofilm matrix. We were able to take direct measurements in a near-native state of the cellulose sheets.

Here, we examined the properties of cholinergic transmission at individual contacts made between direction-selective starburst amacrine cells and downstream ganglion cells in the retina. Using a combination of electrophysiology, serial block-face electron microscopy, and two-photon ACh imaging, we demonstrate that ACh signaling bears the hallmarks of both non-synaptic and synaptic forms of transmission. ACh co-activates nicotinic ACh receptors located on the intersecting dendrites of pairs of ganglion cells, with equal efficiency (non-synaptic)-- and yet retains the ability to generate rapid  miniature currents ([~]1 ms rise times: synaptic). Fast cholinergic signals do not appear to depend on anatomically well-defined synaptic structures. We estimate that ACh spread is limited to [~]1-2 {micro}m from its sites of release, which may help starbursts drive local direction-selective cholinergic responses in ganglion cell dendrites.

One powerful means of transformation involves interactions between excitatory thalamocortical neurons that carry data to cortex and inhibitory neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) that regulate flow of those data3-6. Despite enduring recognition of its importance7-9, understanding of TRN cell types, their organization, and their functional properties has lagged that of the thalamocortical systems they control.

Here we address this, investigating somatosensory and visual circuits of the TRN. In the somatosensory TRN we observed two groups of genetically defined neurons that are topographically segregated, physiologically distinct, and connect reciprocally with independent thalamocortical nuclei via dynamically divergent synapses. Calbindin-expressing cells, located in the central core, connect with the ventral posterior nucleus (VP), the primary somatosensory thalamocortical relay. In contrast, somatostatin-expressing cells, residing along the surrounding edges of TRN, synapse with the posterior medial thalamic nucleus (POM), a higher-order structure that carries both top-down and bottom-up information10-12. The two TRN cell groups process their inputs in pathway-specific ways. Synapses from VP to central TRN cells transmit rapid excitatory currents that depress deeply during repetitive activity, driving phasic spike output. Synapses from POM to edge TRN cells evoke slower, less depressing excitatory currents that drive more persistent spiking. Differences in intrinsic physiology of TRN cell types, including state-dependent bursting, contribute to these output dynamics. Thus, processing specializations of two somatosensory TRN subcircuits appear to be tuned to the signals they carry--a primary central subcircuit to discrete sensory events, and a higher-order edge subcircuit to temporally distributed signals integrated from multiple sources.

This study assessed differences in white matter (WM) microstructure between HD patients and controls, and tested whether drumming training stimulates WM remodelling in HD. Furthermore, it examined whether training-induced microstructural changes are related to improvements in motor and cognitive function.

MethodsParticipants undertook two months of drumming exercises. Working memory and executive function were assessed before and after training. Changes in WM microstructure were investigated with diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI)-based metrics, the restricted diffusion signal fraction (Fr) from the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion (CHARMED) and the macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) from quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging. WM pathways linking the putamen and the supplementary motor area (SMA-Putamen), and three segments of the corpus callosum (CCI, CCII, CCIII) were studied using deterministic tractography. Baseline MPF differences between patients and controls were assessed with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).

ResultsMPF was reduced in HD patients compared to controls in the mid-section of the CC in HD subjects at baseline, while a significantly greater change in MPF was detected in HD patients relative to controls in the CCII, CCIII, and the right SMA-putamen post-training. Further, although patients improved their drumming and executive function performance, such improvements did not correlate with microstructural changes.

ConclusionsIncreased MPF suggests training-induced myelin changes in HD. Tailored behavioural stimulation may lead to neural benefits in early HD that could be exploited for delaying disease progression.","NA"

Here we considered the complementary hypothesis that methylphenidate might also act by changing the weight on the opportunity cost of a cognitive task. To this end, fifty healthy participants (25 women) completed a novel cognitive effort discounting task that was sensitive to opportunity cost, and required choices between task and leisure. They were tested on methylphenidate, sulpiride or placebo and also underwent an [18F]DOPA PET scan to quantify baseline dopamine synthesis capacity. Methylphenidate boosted choices of cognitive effort over leisure across the group, and this effect was greatest in participants with more striatal dopamine at baseline. The effects of sulpiride did not reach significance. This study strengthens the motivational account of methylphenidates effects on cognition and suggests that methylphenidate reduces the cost of mental labor by increasing striatal dopamine.","NA"

So far, the studies that experimentally investigated the consequences of maternal THs focused on short-term effects, while early organisational effects with long-term consequences, as shown for other prenatal hormones, could also be expected. In this study, we aimed at investigating both the short- and long-term effects of prenatal THs in a bird species, the Japanese quail Coturnix japonica. We experimentally elevated yolk TH content (the prohormone T4, and its active metabolite T3, as well as a combination of both hormones). We analysed hatching success, embryonic development, offspring growth and oxidative stress as well as their potential organisational effects on reproduction, moult, and oxidative stress in adulthood. We found that eggs injected with both hormones had a higher hatching success compared with control eggs, suggesting conversion of T4 into T3 by the embryo. We detected no other clear short-term or long-term effects of yolk THs. These results suggest that yolk thyroid hormones are important in the embryonic stage of precocial birds, but other short- and long-term consequences remain unclear. Research on maternal thyroid hormones will greatly benefit from studies investigating how embryos use and respond to this maternal signalling. Long-term studies on prenatal THs in other taxa in the wild are needed for a better understanding of this hormone-mediated maternal pathway.","NA"

DEGs were employed to construct a protein-protein interaction network (PPI). Then, a smaller network was extracted from the PPI network based on a shortest-path scoring algorithm. 12 genes were recognized that their expression is different between benign and metastatic tumors. Utilizing a network analysis point of view 27 genes around them were selected. Among the total number of 39 identified DEGs, we proposed a number of them that their expression induction or suppression alone or in combination with each other would inhibit tumor progression or metastasis.

They are involved in cell proliferation, energy production under hypoxic conditions, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. Finally, some genes were discovered that have not been reported noticeably in any kind of cancer neither as a biomarker nor curative target.

Hence, the understanding of gene co-expression may shed light on the underlying mechanisms behind the transcriptional regulatory programs affecting tumor development and evolution. For instance, in breast cancer, there is a clear loss of inter-chromosomal (trans-) co-expression, compared with healthy tissue. At the same time cis- (intra-chromosomal) interactions are favored in breast tumors. In order to have a deeper understanding of regulatory phenomena in cancer, here, we constructed Gene Co-expression Networks by using 848 RNA-seq whole-genome samples corresponding to the four breast cancer molecular subtypes, as well as healthy tissue. We quantify the cis-/trans- co-expression imbalance in all phenotypes. Additionally, we measured the association between co-expression and physical distance between genes, and characterized the proportion of intra/inter-cytoband interactions per phenotype. We confirmed loss of trans- co-expression in all molecular subtypes. We also observed that gene cisco-expression decays abruptly with distance in all tumors in contrast with healthy tissue. We observed co-expressed gene hotspots, that tend to be connected at cytoband regions, and coincide accurately with already known copy number altered regions, such as Chr17q12, or Chr8q24.3 for all subtypes. Our methodology recovered different alterations already reported for specific breast cancer subtypes, showing how co-expression network approaches might help to capture distinct events that modify the cell regulatory program.","NA"

These results lead us to explore allosteric HSP70 inhibitors (JG compounds) as myeloma therapeutics. We show these compounds exhibit increased efficacy against acquired and intrinsic PI-resistant myeloma models, unlike HSP90 inhibition. Surprisingly, shotgun and pulsed-SILAC proteomics reveal that JGs overcome PI resistance not via the expected mechanism of inhibiting cytosolic HSP70s, but instead through mitochondrial-localized HSP70, HSPA9, destabilizing the 55S mitoribosome.

In 3D environments and live tumors, we demonstrate that microtubules instability, leading to increased Rho pathway-dependent cell contractility, promotes migration while clinically used microtubule-targeting chemotherapies profoundly decrease effective migration. Indeed, we show that rational manipulation of the microtubule-contractility axis, either pharmacologically or through genome engineering, results in engineered T cells that more effectively move through and interrogate 3D matrix and tumor volumes.

These differences are not accounted for in clinical practice, in part due to a lack of sensitive biomarkers of early response. In this work, we test the hypothesis that quantification of intratumor heterogeneity is a sensitive and robust biomarker of early response to XRT. A novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) approach is proposed, utilizing histogram analysis of clinically-used T2 relaxation measurements to assess early changes in the tumor heterogeneity following irradiation in murine models of pancreatic cancer, indicative of radiotherapy response.

Methods and MaterialsDynamic Magnetic Resonance T2 relaxation imaging was performed every 72h following 10 Gy dose XRT in two murine models of pancreatic cancer. Proposed biomarker of radiotherapy response was compared with tumor growth kinetics, and biological validation was performed through quantitative histology analysis.

ResultsQuantification of tumor T2 interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of histogram width showed excellent sensitivity for detection of XRT-induced tumor changes as early as 72h after treatment, outperforming whole tumor T2 and Diffusion weighted MRI metrics. This response was observed both in quantitative T2 maps and in T2-weighted images that are routine in clinical practice. Histological comparison revealed the T2 IQR provides a measure of spatial heterogeneity in tumor cell density, related to radiation-induced necrosis. The early IQR changes were found to presage subsequent tumor volume changes in two distinct pancreatic models, suggesting promise for treatment response prediction. The metric showed excellent test-retest robustness.

ConclusionsOur preclinical findings indicate that spatial heterogeneity analysis of T2 MRI can provide a sensitive and readily translatable method for early radiotherapy response assessment in pancreatic cancer. We propose that this will be useful in adaptive radiotherapy, specifically in MRI-guided treatment paradigms.","NA"

However, how neuron populations of the VP with different firing properties represent these variables is not fully understood. Therefore, we trained mice on auditory Pavlovian conditioning and recorded the activity of VP neurons while mice were performing the task. Many VP neurons responded to punishment (51%) and reward (44%), either by firing rate increase or decrease. Additionally, 20% of cells responded to outcome-predicting auditory stimuli, showing larger responses to reward-predicting cues compared to those that signaled likely punishment. We found that a large subset of VP neurons showed burst firing based on their auto-correlograms, while a small population exhibited fast rhythmic discharge in the beta/gamma frequency range. Some bursting neurons exhibited distinct response properties of their bursts and single spikes, suggesting a multiplexed coding scheme in the VP. However, non-bursting, non-rhythmic neurons were the most sensitive to reward and punishment. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of synchronously firing neuron assemblies in the VP. Neurons participating in such assemblies were particularly responsive to reinforcing stimuli. This suggests that a synchronous, non-bursting, non-rhythmic neuron population of the VP is responsible for the lions share of ventral pallidal salience representation, likely important for reinforcement learning.

Significance statementThe ventral pallidum (VP) is a subcortical brain area that participates in regulating motion and emotion by processing information related to appetitive and aversive stimuli. However, how these stimuli are represented by VP neural circuits is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated how VP neuron populations defined by their firing properties respond to reward and punishment during Pavlovian conditioning. We found that a distinct, non-bursting-non-rhythmic group of neurons was responsible for most responses to reward and punishment in the VP. Neurons of this group formed co-active cell assemblies and multiplexed different types of information via different firing patterns, revealing flexible and plastic neuronal representation strategies in the VP during associative learning.","NA"

We demonstrate that, compared to regular transfer-learning, meta-learning is a significantly more effective paradigm to leverage high-dimensional data that is relevant but not directly related to the problem of interest. Specifically, meta-learning explicitly constructs a model, from abundant data of relevant tasks, to learn a new task with few samples effectively. For the application of predicting cancer survival outcome, we also show that the meta-learning framework with a few samples is able to achieve competitive performance with learning from scratch with a significantly larger number of samples. Finally, we demonstrate that the meta-learning model implicitly prioritizes genes based on their contribution to survival prediction and allows us to identify important pathways in cancer.","NA"

This study aimed at elucidating the frequency and magnitude of dispersal of highly vagile saltmarsh mosquitoes from productive off-shore bay islands to adjacent coastal human developments. Inter-population dynamics and daily host-seeking activity of saltmarsh mosquitoes were monitored daily at 15-minute intervals within a productive bay island and adjacent coastal development in southeast Queensland, Australia, using emerging smart trap technology over a 2-month period of high mosquito activity. The regulation of mosquito dispersal and host-seeking activity by local environmental factors, e.g. temperature, relative humidity and hourly wind patterns, were also investigated. The data show that the primary saltmarsh mosquitoes Aedes vigilax (Skuse) and Culex sitiens (Wiedemann) disperse from offshore breeding sites to neighboring mainland areas in high numbers and in highly synchronized waves despite unfavorable wind patterns and the need to traverse a considerable expanse (ca. 1.4 km) of open water. Patterns of host-seeking activity within each site were also remarkably similar despite notable differences in the local environment demonstrating a consistency in host-seeking activity across disparate habitats. These findings demonstrate that distant saltmarsh habitats, including offshore breeding sites, are likely to be primary sources of mosquito nuisance for coastal housing developments. This observation highlights the need to develop new planning and regulatory guidelines that alert urban planners to the risks of encroaching on habitats close to the sources of highly vagile mosquito species.","NA"

As commercial demand rises for marine resources, it is critical to generate baseline information for monitoring wild populations. Furthermore, anthropogenic stressors on the coastal environment, such as warming sea surface temperatures and overharvesting of wild populations, are leading to the destruction of keystone marine species such as kelps. In this study, we conducted a fine-scale genetic analysis using genome-wide high-density markers on Northwest Atlantic sugar kelp species, Saccharina latissima and putative species, Saccharina angustissima. The population structure for a total of 149 samples from the Gulf of Maine (GOM) and Southern New England (SNE) was investigated using AMOVA, Fst, admixture, and PCoA. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted for six morphological traits, and the extended Lewontin and Krakauer (FLK) test was used to detect selection signatures. Our results indicate that the GOM region is moderately more heterogeneous than SNE. While admixture was observed between regions, these results confirm that Cape Cod acts as a biogeographic barrier for sugar kelp gene flow. We detected one significant SNP (P-value=2.03x10-7) associated with stipe length, and 243 SNPs with higher-than-neutral differentiation. The findings of this study provide fundamental knowledge on sugar kelp population genetics for future monitoring, managing and potentially restoring wild populations, as well as assisting in selective breeding to improve desirable traits for cultivation and bioenergy production.","NA"

We identify the specific proteases (members of the secreted aspartyl protease (SAP) family) needed for opaque cells to proliferate under these conditions, and we identify four transcriptional regulators of this specialized proteolysis and uptake program. We also show that, in mixed cultures, opaque cells enable white cells to also proliferate efficiently when proteins are the sole nitrogen source.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an inflammatory cytokine secreted by tumor cells and bone-derived immune cells that contributes to chronic inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. IL-1 is elevated in PCa patients and contributes to PCa progression and treatment resistance. IL-1 has been shown to promote PCa metastasis and bone colonization, shown to recruit mesenchymal stems cells to the tumor to support castration-resistant PCa (CRPCa) development and chronic IL-1 exposure was shown to promote PCa anti-androgen resistance. We previously reported that acute IL-1 exposure represses androgen receptor (AR) accumulation and activity, providing a possible mechanism for IL-1-mediated development of androgen- and AR-independent PCa. Given that acute inflammation is quickly resolved, and chronic inflammation is, instead, co-opted by cancer cells to promote tumorigenicity, we set out to determine if chronic IL-1 exposure leads to similar repression of AR and AR activity observed for acute IL-1 exposure and to determine if chronic IL-1 exposure selects for androgen- and AR-independent PCa cells.

MethodsWe isolated isogenic LNCaP sublines from LNCaP cells chronically exposed for 3-4 months to IL-1 or IL-1{beta}. LNCaP and the IL-1 sublines were treated with IL-1, IL-1{beta}, TNF or conditioned medium from the HS-5 bone marrow stromal cell line to assess cell viability in the presence of cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines. Cell viability was also assessed following serum starvation, AR siRNA silencing and treatment with the anti-androgen, enzalutamide. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were also performed for the IL-1 sublines.

ResultsMTT, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis show that the sublines evolved resistance to inflammation-induced cytotoxicity and intracellular signaling and evolved reduced sensitivity to siRNA-mediated loss of AR, serum deprivation and enzalutamide. Furthermore, differential gene expression reveals that canonical AR signaling is aberrant in the IL-1 sublines, where the cells show constitutive PSA repression and basally high KLK2 and NKX3.1 mRNA levels and bioinformatics analysis predicts that pro-survival and pro-tumorigenic pathways are activated in the sublines.

ConclusionsOur data provide evidence that chronic IL-1 exposure promotes PCa cell androgen and AR independence and, thus, supports CRPCa development.","NA"

The application of IMS to lens tissue localizes molecular features that are spatially related to the fiber cell organization. Such spatially resolved molecular information assists our understanding of lens structure and physiology; however, protein IMS studies are typically limited to abundant, soluble, low molecular weight proteins. In this study, a method was developed for imaging low solubility cytoskeletal proteins in the lens; a tissue that is filled with high concentrations of soluble crystallins. Optimized tissue washes combined with on-tissue enzymatic digestion allowed successful imaging of peptides corresponding to known lens cytoskeletal proteins. The resulting peptide signals facilitated segmentation of the bovine lens into molecularly distinct regions. A sharp intermediate filament transition from vimentin to lens-specific beaded filament proteins was detected in the lens cortex. MALDI IMS also revealed the region where posttranslational myristoylation of filensin occurs and the results indicate that truncation and myristoylation of filensin starts soon after filensin expression increased in the inner cortex. From intermediate filament switch to filensin truncation and myristoylation, multiple remarkable changes occur in the narrow region of lens cortex.

The local anti-tumour immune response is particularly important for patients with stage II where the tumour-draining lymph nodes have not yet succumbed to tumour spread. The lymph nodes allow for the expansion and release of B cell compartments such as primary follicles and germinal centres. A variation in this anti-tumour immune response may influence the observed clinical heterogeneity in stage II patients.

AimThe aim of this study was to explore tumour-draining lymph node histomorphological changes and tumour pathological risk factors including the immunomodulatory microRNA-21 (miR-21) in a small cohort of stage II CRC.

MethodsA total of 23 stage II colorectal cancer patients were included. Tumour and normal mucosa samples were analysed for miR-21 expression levels and B-cell compartments were quantified from Haematoxylin and Eosin slides of lymph nodes. These measures were compared to clinicopathological risk factors such as perforation, bowel obstruction, T4 stage and high-grade.

ResultsWe observed greater follicle density in patients with a lower tumour T stage and higher germinal centre density in patients with higher pre-operative carcinoembryonic antigen levels. Trends were also detected between tumours with deficiency in mismatch repair proteins, lymphatic invasion and both the density and size of B-cell compartments. Lastly, elevated tumour miR-21 was associated with decreased follicle and germinal centre size.

ConclusionVariation in B-cell compartments of tumour-draining lymph nodes is associated with clinicopathological risk factors in stage II CRC patients.

Flow cytometric and confocal microscopy studies indicated that AF-SWCNTs were efficiently internalized by both cell lines and were localized essentially in the cytoplasmic area. In the scratch wound repair model, exposure to AF-SWCNTs blocked the filling of the scratched area of the cellular monolayers in both cells. Behaviour of the cells around the scratch area was examined in by live-cell imaging time-lapse micrography. The results indicated active cell proliferation around the scratch area that was totally blocked by AF-SWCNTs in LA4 cells and significantly inhibited in A549 cells.

However, in the blood cell system it remains largely unclear how transdifferentiation is regulated in vivo. Here we reveal the environmental control of blood cell transdifferentiation in a Drosophila melanogaster model. Functional lineage tracing provides new in vivo evidence for direct transdifferentiation from macrophage-like plasmatocytes to crystal cells that execute melanization. Interestingly, this transdifferentiation is promoted by neuronal activity of a specific subset of sensory neurons, in the sensory cones at the caudal end of the larva. Evidence for this stems from specific neuron ablation, and transient silencing or activation of these neurons by Kir2.1 or TrpA1, respectively. Crystal cells develop from plasmatocytes in clusters surrounding the sensory cones. Strikingly, environmental conditions trigger this process: oxygen sensing, through atypical guanylyl cyclases (Gyc88E, Gyc89Da, Gyc89Db) that are specifically expressed in sensory cone neurons, drives plasmatocyte-to-crystal cell transdifferentiation, as hypoxia or gyc silencing cause crystal cell reduction and loss of transdifferentiation. Our findings reveal an unexpected functional and molecular link of environment-monitoring sensory neurons governing blood cell transdifferentiation in vivo, suggesting similar principles in vertebrate systems where environmental sensors and blood cell populations coincide.

In the Xenopus embryonic epidermis, multiciliated cells (MCCs) are born in a random pattern within an inner mesenchymal layer, and subsequently intercalate at regular intervals into an outer epithelial layer. Using both experiments and mathematical modelling, we show that this transition from chaotic to ordered distribution relies on mutual repulsion among motile immature MCCs, and affinity towards outer-layer intercellular junctions. Consistently, ARP2/3-mediated actin remodelling is required for MCC pattern emergence. Using multiple functional approaches, we show that the Kit tyrosine kinase receptor, expressed in MCCs, and its ligand Scf, expressed in outer-layer cells, are both required for regular MCC distribution. While Scf behaves as a potent adhesive cue for MCCs, Kit expression is sufficient to confer order to a disordered heterologous cell population. Our work reveals how a single signalling system can implement self-organised large-scale patterning.

Recently, Vasohibin-1 was found to mediate tubulin detyrosination, a post-translational modification that is implicated in many cell functions, such as cell division. Here we used the zebrafish embryo to investigate the cellular and subcellular mechanisms of Vash-1 on endothelial microtubules during formation of the trunk vasculature. We show that microtubules within venous-derived secondary sprouts are strongly and selectively detyrosinated in comparison with other endothelial cells, and that this difference is lost upon vash-1 knockdown. Vasohibin-1 depletion in zebrafish specifically affected secondary sprouting from the posterior cardinal vein, increasing both the number of sprouts and endothelial cell divisions.

Therefore, breeders typically rely on visual selection of small, unreplicated seed increase plots for the promotion of breeding lines to replicated yield trials. With the development of aerial high-throughput phenotyping technologies, breeders now have the ability to rapidly phenotype thousands of breeding lines for traits that may be useful for indirect selection of grain yield. We evaluated early generation material in the irrigated bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding program at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center to determine if aerial measurements of vegetation indices assessed on small, unreplicated plots were predictive of grain yield. To test this approach, two sets of 1,008 breeding lines were sown both as replicated yield trials and as small, unreplicated plots during two breeding cycles. Vegetation indices collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle in the small plots were observed to be heritable and moderately correlated with grain yield assessed in replicated yield trials. Furthermore, vegetation indices were more predictive of grain yield than univariate genomic selection, while multi-trait genomic selection approaches that combined genomic information with the aerial phenotypes were found to have the highest predictive abilities overall. A related experiment showed that selection approaches for grain yield based on vegetation indices could be more effective than visual selection; however, selection on the vegetation indices alone would have also driven a directional response in phenology due to confounding between those traits. A restricted selection index was proposed for improving grain yield without affecting the distribution of phenology in the breeding population. The results of these experiments provide a promising outlook for the use of aerial high-throughput phenotyping traits to improve selection at the early-generation seed-limited stage of wheat breeding programs.","NA"

It contributes to the virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The involvement of GlgE in glycogen biosynthesis was discovered twenty years ago when the phenotype of a temperature-sensitive Mycobacterium smegmatis mutation was rescued by the glgE gene. The evidence at the time suggested glgE coded for a glucanase responsible for the hydrolysis of glycogen, in stark contrast with recent evidence showing GlgE to be a polymerase responsible for its biosynthesis.

MethodsWe reconstructed and examined the temperature-sensitive mutant and characterised the mutated GlgE enzyme.

ResultsThe mutant strain accumulated the substrate for GlgE, -maltose-1-phosphate, at the non-permissive temperature rather than glycogen. The glycogen assay used in the original study was shown to give a false positive result with -maltose-1-phosphate. The accumulation of -maltose-1-phosphate was primarily due to the lowering of the kcatapp of GlgE, rather than a loss of thermo stability. The reported rescue of the phenotype by GarA appeared not to involve a direct interaction with GlgE. It more likely acts as a decoy to prevent the Ser/Thr protein kinase PknB from phosphorylating GlgE, alleviating the polymerase from negative regulation.

ConclusionsWe have therefore been able to reconcile apparently contradictory observations and shed light on the molecular basis for the phenotype of the temperature-sensitive mutation.

General SignificanceThis study highlights how perturbing flux through the GlgE pathway without blocking it can affect the growth rate of mycobacteria.","NA"

Although its genomic size is 11 Gbps, it is still too large to assemble well within a short period of time. Transcriptomics is the one another approach to address this. Moreover, it is a necessary step in obtaining the complete genomic data. Here we designed a three stages assembling workflow using the de novo transcriptome assembly tools, Oases and Trinity. The three stages in transcriptomics are independent assembly, automatic and semi-automatic integration, and refinement by filtering out potential contamination. We found a set of 49,795 cDNA and an equal number of translated proteins (CJ3006NRE). According to the benchmark of BUSCO, 87.01 % were complete genes, including very high ""Complete and single-copy"" genes-78.47%. Compared to other full-length cDNA resources, the extent of the coverage in CJ3006NRE suggests that it may be used as the standard for further studies. When two tissue-specific libraries were compared, principal component analysis (PCA) showed that there were significant differences between male strobili and leaf and bark sets. The highest three upregulated transcription factors stood out as orthologs to angiosperms. The identified signature-like domain of the transcription factors demonstrated the accuracy of the assembly. Based on the evaluation of different resources, we demonstrate that our transcriptome assembly output is valuable and useful for further studies in functional genomics and evolutionary biology.","NA"

Frequency domain spectral analysis of time records from isolated MTs disclosed a richer oscillatory response as compared to that observed in voltage clamped MT sheets from the same preparation. The data indicate that isolated brain MTs are electrical oscillators that behave as ""ionic-based"" transistors whose activity may be synchronized in higher MT structures.

Recent in vitro electrophysiological studies indicate that different brain MT structures, including two-dimensional sheets and bundles, generate highly synchronous electrical oscillations. However, no information has been heretofore available as to whether isolated MTs also engage in electrical oscillations. In the present study, a broader spectrum of fundamental frequencies was always observed in isolated MTs as compared to the MT sheets. This interesting finding is consistent with the possibility that more structured MT complexes (i.e. bundles, sheets) may render more coherent response at given oscillatory frequencies and raise the hypothesis that combined MTs may tend to oscillate and entrain together. The present study provides to our knowledge the first experimental evidence for electrical oscillations of single brain MTs.","NA"

In this study, we demonstrate a novel role of PRY-1/Axin in AAK-2 activation to regulate DAF-16 function. The pry-1 transcriptome contains many genes associated with aging and muscle function. Consistent with this, pry-1 is strongly expressed in muscles and muscle-specific overexpression of pry-1 extends the lifespan, delays muscle aging, and improves mitochondrial morphology in DAF-16-dependent manner. Furthermore, PRY-1 is necessary for AAK-2 phosphorylation. Together, our data demonstrate a crucial role of PRY-1 in maintaining the lifespan and muscle health.

Long thought to be stable structures, PNNs have been recently shown to respond dynamically during learning, potentially regulating the formation of new synapses. We postulated that PNNs may vary during sleep, a period of active synaptic modification. Notably, PNN components are cleaved by matrix proteases such as the protease cathepsin-S, synthesized by microglia. Cathepsin-S is expressed in a diurnal manner in the mouse cortex, coinciding with dendritic spine density rhythms. Thus, cathepsin-S may induce PNN remodeling during sleep, mediating synaptic reorganization. These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that PNN numbers vary in a diurnal manner in the rodent and human brain, and in a circadian manner in the rodent brain, in association with cathepsin-S expression rhythms coinciding with reported rhythms in synaptic plasticity. In mice, we observed diurnal and circadian rhythms of PNNs labeled with the lectin wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA+PNNs) in several brain regions involved in emotional memory processing. Sleep deprivation prevented the daytime decrease of WFA+ PNNs. Diurnal rhythms of cathepsin-S expression in microglia were observed in the same brain regions, opposite to PNN rhythms. Finally, incubation of mouse sections with cathepsin-S eliminated PNN labeling. In humans, WFA+PNNs showed a diurnal rhythm in the amygdala and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Our results demonstrate that PNNs vary in a circadian manner that coincides with expression rhythms of cathepsin-S in the mouse hippocampus. We suggest that rhythmic modification of PNNs may contribute to memory consolidation during sleep.","NA"

In BriefYang et al. report abnormal synaptic reorganization in an epileptogenesis zone in a mouse model of cortical malformation. The authors further demonstrate that spontaneous spike-wave discharges can be curbed by selectively activating somatostatin interneurons using close-loop fiber optogenetic stimulation to a small cortical region away from the microgyrus.

SummaryHow aberrant neural circuits contribute to chronic epilepsy remains unclear. Using a mouse model of focal cortical malformation with spontaneous seizures, we dissected the circuit mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis. Spontaneous and optogenetically induced hyperexcitable bursts in vivo were present in a cortical region distal to (> 1mm) freeze-lesion induced microgyrus, instead of a region near it. ChR2-assisted circuit mapping revealed ectopic interlaminar excitatory inputs from infragranular layers to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons as a key component of the hyperexcitable circuitry. This disrupted balance between excitation and inhibition was prominent in the cortical region distal to the microgyrus. Consistently, the synapses of both parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV) and somatostatin-positive interneurons (SOM) to pyramidal neurons were maladaptive in a layer- and site-specific fashion. Finally, closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of SOM, but not PV, terminated spontaneous spike-wave discharges. Together, these results demonstrate highly site- and cell-type specific synaptic reorganization underlying chronic cortical epilepsy and provide insights into potential treatment strategies for this devastating neurological disorder.","NA"

However, with some notable exceptions, previous studies have relied on cross-sectional designs, limited age ranges, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based on conventional single-shell dMRI. In this mixed crosssectional and longitudinal study (mean interval: 15.2 months) including 702 multi-shell dMRI datasets, we combined complementary dMRI models to investigate age trajectories in healthy individuals aged 18 to 94 years (56.98% women). Using linear mixed effect models and machine learning based brain age prediction, we assessed the age-dependence of diffusion metrics, and compared the prediction accuracy of six different diffusion models, including diffusion tensor (DTI) and kurtosis imaging (DKI), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), spherical mean technique multicompartment (SMT-mc), and white matter tract integrity (WMTI). The results showed that the age slopes for conventional DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy [FA], medial diffusivity [MD], radial diffusivity [RD]) were largely consistent with previous research, and that all diffusion models indicated lower white matter integrity with older age. Linear mixed effects models and brain age prediction showed that the  FA fine metric of the RSI model and  orientation dispersion (OD) metric of the NODDI model showed highest sensitivity to age.

To test this hypothesis, we have developed a peptide library-based exposition system (Cleavage of exposed amino acid sequences, CleavEx) aiming at investigating the potential of KLK14 to recognize and hydrolyze proMMP sequences specifically. Initial assessment of the library identified a total of ten MMP activation domain sequences which were validated by Edman degradation. The CleavEx analysis revealed that membrane-type (MT) MMPs are likely targeted by KLK14 for activation. Correspondingly, commercially available proMT-MMPs, namely proMMP14-17 were investigated in vitro and found to be effectively processed by KLK14. Again, the expected neo-N-termini of the activated MT MMPs were yielded and confirmed by Edman degradation. In addition, the productivity of proMMP activation was analyzed by gelatin zymography, which indicated the release of fully active, mature MT-MMPs upon KLK14 treatment.

In this work, we introduce a fast and scalable algorithm for calculating gapped k-mer string kernels. Our method, named FastSK, uses a simplified kernel formulation that decomposes the kernel calculation into a set of independent counting operations over the possible mismatch positions. This simplified decomposition allows us to devise a fast Monte Carlo approximation that rapidly converges. FastSK can scale to much greater feature lengths, allows us to consider more mismatches, and is performant on a variety of sequence analysis tasks.

Mutations in DYRK1B have been associated with metabolic syndrome and sarcopenic obesity in humans, underscoring the critical role of the encoded protein in skeletal muscle development and homeostasis. By the novel creation of Dyrk1b knockout zebrafish models we demonstrate that Dyrk1b kinase activity is critical for specification of the paraxial myoD. Mechanistically, Dyrk1b mediates and amplifies Fgf signaling in the paraxial domain by the transcriptional suppression of its negative feedback inhibitor sprouty1. In the adaxial myoD domain, Dyrk1b amplifies Shh signaling and partially rescues defects caused by its disruption. The investigations of C2C12 terminal differentiation revealed that Dyrk1b also plays a critical role in myofiber fusion. Combined biochemical and proteomic analysis of C2C12 myoblasts undergoing differentiation showed that Dyrk1b kinase activation is induced by shh inhibition, and triggers differentiation by inhibiting mTOR, subsequent upregulation of 4e-bp1 and induction of autophagy. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Dyrk1b plays a critical role in sustaining myocyte specification and differentiation by integrating Fgf, Shh and mTORC1 signaling pathways.","NA"

In this study, we examine genetic associations arising from an analysis of 648 UK Biobank GWAS and evaluate whether targets identified as proxies of direct genetic hits are enriched for successful drug targets, as measured by historical clinical trial data.

We find that protein networks formed from specific functional linkages such as protein complexes and ligand-receptor pairs are suitable for even naive guilt-by-association network propagation approaches. In addition, more sophisticated approaches applied to global protein-protein interaction networks and pathway databases, also successfully retrieve targets enriched for clinically successful drug targets.

Here we use a lattice model of self-assembly as a coarse-grained representation of protein complex assembly, and show that it can be used to examine potential evolutionary advantages of duplication. Duplication provides a unique mechanism for increasing the evolvability of protein complexes by enabling the transformation of symmetric homomeric interactions into heteromeric ones. This transformation is extensively observed in in silico evolutionary simulations of the lattice model, with duplication events significantly accelerating the rate at which structural complexity increases. These coarse-grained simulation results are corroborated with a large-scale analysis of complexes from the Protein Data Bank.","NA"

Many studies implicate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and propose that it drives brain-wide focus by biasing processing in favour of relevant information. An alternative, however, is that dlPFC is involved in the inhibition of irrelevant information. Here, we address this longstanding debate using the inferentially powerful approach of applying transcranial magnetic stimulation during functional magnetic resonance imaging (concurrent TMS-fMRI) and testing for changes in information coding using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). We ask whether dlPFC plays a causal role in prioritising information processing, and whether this is through selection of relevant information or inhibition of irrelevant information. Participants attended to one object feature whilst ignoring another feature of the same object. We reasoned that, if dlPFC is necessary for selection, active (disruptive) TMS should decrease coding of attended information compared to the low intensity (control) condition. Conversely, if right dlPFC is crucial for inhibition, active TMS should increase coding of irrelevant information relative to the control condition. The results showed that active TMS decreased coding of relevant information throughout the frontoparietal multiple demand regions, and that this impact was significantly stronger than the effect of TMS on irrelevant information coding, which was not statistically detectable. These data provide causal evidence for a specific role of dlPFC in supporting the representation of task-relevant information and demonstrate the crucial insights into high level cognitive-neural mechanisms possible with the combination of TMS-fMRI and MVPA.","NA"

While available lifespan data is continually accumulating, further understanding of the aging process is still limited by the poor understanding of epistasis and of the non-linear interactions between multiple longevity-associated genes. Unfortunately, based on observations so far, there is no simple method to predict the cumulative impact of genes on lifespan. As a step towards applying predictive methods, but also to provide information for a guided design of epistasis lifespan experiments, we developed SynergyAge - a database containing genetic and lifespan data for animal models obtained through multiple longevity-modulating interventions. The studies included in SynergyAge focus on the lifespan of animal strains which are modified by at least two genetic interventions, with single gene mutants included as reference. SynergyAge, which is publicly available at www.synergyage.info, provides an easy to use web-platform for browsing, searching and filtering through the data, as well as a network-based interactive module for visualization and analysis.

Database URL: http://www.synergyage.info/

BACKGROUND & SUMMARYThe aging process can be genetically modulated. This has been previously shown in many studies in which average lifespan, and in some cases even maximum lifespan, has been modified by genetic interventions. It is for example possible to have genetic mutants with an increased lifespan, up to ten times higher compared to wild type in C. elegans 1, and up to 150% and 46% in D. melanogaster and M. musculus, respectively 2,3. Up until now, at least 2,205 genes, whose mutations, downregulation or overexpression results in a long- or short-lived phenotype, have been identified in model organisms. A comprehensive list with these longevity-associated genes (LAGs), including more detailed information about lifespan experiments, can be found in the GenAge database 4. This type and amount of data have made it possible for higher level analyses to be performed 5-7, and the collection of LAGs in public repositories has significantly pushed biogerontology towards more integrative approaches to study longevity. One important aspect observed is that many LAGs seem to act in a cooperative manner 8-10 and are not independent regulators of lifespan. In fact, in most cases when combining two or more genetic interventions, the effect is rarely additive, as genes are generally epistatic and interact in nonlinear ways 11,12. While in most cases combined interventions seem to have lower than expected results in how much they extend lifespan, there are also a minority of cases where genes act synergistically 13,14. Even so, the much more common case is that of studies where partially dependent gene interactions are revealed, making it even more important to understand and predict genetic dependencies.

Unfortunately, data on epistasis is much harder to obtain through wide-screen experimental studies, which has been for example the case for the discovery of most LAG interventions in worms. The main impediment comes from the combinatorial explosion of multiple gene groups for which lifespan assays would need to be measured in a ""blind"" search, through wet-lab experiments. Instead, it would be more efficient to use existing epistasis data to explore predicted synergies in guided lifespan experiments. Luckily, an accumulating number of papers has been published in the last two decades with reported lifespans for double mutants and in some cases even triple or quadruple mutants. As such, it has been now possible for us: (i) to collect the data from existing studies containing lifespan records for strains that have multiple genes modulated, and (ii) to create an intuitive, network-based tool, which allows users to explore in a fast, visual and interactive way the lifespan relationships between these strains.

Here, we present SynergyAge, a database containing manually curated data, extracted from experimental studies, regarding gene combinations that affect lifespan. With the creation of SynergyAge, we aim to encourage the investigation of the cumulative effects of different gene interventions on lifespan, by providing the scientific community with a ""one-stop"" web platform to access, compare and analyze lifespan synergisms or antagonisms. This resource is of particular interest in designing wet-lab experiments in which multi-genetic lifespan interventions are needed. SynergyAge (http://www.synergyage.info) is publicly available and contains data from three animal model organisms: Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus.","NA"

However, software designed to specifically search for sex-biased markers using RAD-Seq data is lacking. Here, we present RADSex, a computational analysis workflow designed to study the genetic basis of sex determination using RAD-Seq data. RADSex is simple to use, requires few computational resources, makes no prior assumptions about type of sex-determination system or structure of the sex locus, and offers convenient visualization through a dedicated R package. To demonstrate the functionality of RADSex, we re-analyzed a published dataset of Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes, where we uncovered a previously unknown Y chromosome polymorphism. We then used RADSex to analyze new RAD-Seq datasets from 15 fish species spanning multiple systematic orders. We identified the sex determination system and sex-specific markers in six of these species, five of which had no known sex-markers prior to this study. We show that RADSex greatly facilitates the study of sex determination systems in non-model species and outperforms the commonly used RAD-Seq analysis software STACKS.

An RNAi suppression screen to identify transcription factors involved in the production of gst-4 mRNA in brap-2 worms identified SEM-4 as a potential candidate. Here, we show that knockdown of sem-4 suppresses the activation of gst-4 caused by the mutation in brap-2. We also demonstrate that sem-4 is required for survival upon exposure to oxidative stress and that SEM-4 is required for expression of the transcription factor SKN-1C. These findings identify a novel role for SEM-4 in ROS detoxification by regulating expression of SKN-1C and the phase II detoxification genes.

Unmodified H3K36 occupies a critical position in the EZH2-DNA interface. Mutation of H3K36 inhibits H3K27 methylation by PRC2. Accordingly, Drosophila H3K36 mutants show altered H3K27me3 profiles and deregulated expression of HOX genes.

S.; Super, H.","Alejandro Lerer","Universitat de Barcelona","2020-04-23",1,"cc_by","new results","neuroscience","The visual system is highly sensitive to spatial context for encoding luminance patterns. Context sensitivity inspired the proposal of many neural mechanisms for explaining the perception of luminance (brightness). Here we propose a novel computational model for estimating the brightness of many visual illusions. We hypothesize that many aspects of brightness can be explained by a predictive coding mechanism, which reduces the redundancy in edge representations on the one hand, while non-redundant activity is enhanced on the other (response equalization). Response equalization is implemented with a dynamic filtering process, which (dynamically) adapts to each input image. Dynamic filtering is applied to the responses of complex cells in order to build a gain control map. The gain control map then acts on simple cell responses before they are used to create a brightness map via activity propagation. Our approach is successful in predicting many challenging visual illusions, including contrast effects, assimilation, and reverse contrast.

Author summaryWe hardly notice that what we see is often different from the physical world ""outside"" of the brain. This means that the visual experience that the brain actively constructs may be different from the actual physical properties of objects in the world. In this work, we propose a hypothesis about how the visual system of the brain may construct a representation for achromatic images. Since this process is not unambiguous, sometimes we notice ""errors"" in our perception, which cause visual illusions. The challenge for theorists, therefore, is to propose computational principles that recreate a large number of visual illusions and to explain why they occur. Notably, our proposed mechanism explains a broader set of visual illusions than any previously published proposal. We achieved this by trying to suppress predictable information. For example, if an image contained repetitive structures, then these structures are predictable and would be suppressed. In this way, non-predictable structures stand out. Predictive coding mechanisms act as early as in the retina (which enhances luminance changes but suppresses uniform regions of luminance), and our computational model holds that this principle also acts at the next stage in the visual system, where representations of perceived luminance (brightness) are created.","NA"

We exploit these conditions to empirically identify effects of exposure to the 1918 flu pandemic, those of the devastation left by an earthquake-tsunami that struck the island in 1918, and those associated with the joint occurrence of these events. We use geographic variation to identify the effects of the quake and timing of birth variation to identify those of the flu. In addition, we use markers of nutritional status gathered in a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 75 and older in 2002. This unique data set enables to make two distinct contributions. First, unlike most fetal-origins research that singles out early nutritional status as a determinant of adult health, we test the hypothesis that the 1918 flu had deleterious effects on the nutritional status on adult survivors who at the time of the flu were in utero or infants. Second, and unlike most research on the effects of the flu, we focus on markers of nutritional status set when the adult survivors were children or adolescents. We find that estimates of effects of the pandemic are sizeable primarily among females and among those who, in addition to the flu, were exposed to the earthquake-tsunami. We argue that these findings constitute empirical evidence supporting the conjecture that effects of the 1918 flu alone and the combined effects of the flu and the earthquake are associated not just with damage experienced during the fetal period but also postnatally.","NA"

The goal was to investigate potential negative versus positive effects of BC on pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and nutrient (P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) availability in a calcareous loamy sandy soil. The results showed that application of OMSW-derived BC, especially with increasing pyrolysis temperature and/or application rate, significantly increased soil pH, EC, NH4OAc-extractable K, Na, Ca, and Mg, and ammonium bicarbonate-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (AB-DTPA)-extractable Fe and Zn, while AB-DTPA-extractable Mn decreased. The application of 1% and 3% BC, respectively, increased the NH4OAc-extractable K by 2.5 and 5.2-fold for BC300, by 3.2 and 8.0-fold for BC500, and by 3.3 and 8.9-fold for BC700 compared with that of untreated soil.

If an accurate and simple haplogroup-tracking tool were available, haplogrouping could be performed easily and rapidly. Here, we present Haplotracker, a web application for highly accurate and simple haplogroup tracking using a few sequence fragments. Haplotracker offers a unique user-friendly interface and estimates highly probable haplogroups from control-region sequences using a novel algorithm based on Phylotree Build 17 and our haplotype database (n=118,869). Haplotracker provides a simple, novel HG tracking solution, which was established through repeated blind simulation tests. It narrows down potential haplogroups and identifies their differential coding-region variants to confirm the haplogroups or to track sub-haplogroups. Haplotracker gives detailed information on sample variants, including their frequency in a large mtGenome database, which may give researchers an insight into common, rare, and potentially pathogenic mutations. It also offers a conserved region mapping tool for PCR primer design for successful tracking. Haplotracker produced high haplogroup prediction accuracy using 8,216 control-region Phylotree-provided sequences. It estimated top-ranking haplogroups with a higher concordance rate (56.6%, p<0.0001) than the similar tools MitoTool (29.4%) and HaploGrep 2 (33.9%). The significance persisted up to Rank 30. Haplotracker accurately estimated super-HGs from 94% of the control-region sequences at Rank 1. Further evaluation of the accuracy with 46,322 control-region sequences was significant. Laboratory application of Haplotracker to an ancient DNA extract demonstrated its practical usefulness. These results highlight the potential for the use of our web application as an alternative to full genome sequencing for easy haplogrouping, which may be useful in related fields.

MCPyV positive MCCs harbor integrated, defective viral genomes that constitutively express viral oncogenes. Which molecular mechanisms promote viral integration, if distinct integration patterns exist, and if integration occurs preferentially at loci with specific chromatin states is unknown.

We here combined short and long-read (nanopore) next-generation sequencing and present the first high-resolution analysis of integration site structure in MCC cell lines as well as primary tumor material. We find two main types of integration site structure: Linear patterns with chromosomal breakpoints that map closely together, and complex integration loci that exhibit local amplification of genomic sequences flanking the viral DNA. Sequence analysis suggests that linear patterns are produced during viral replication by integration of defective/linear genomes into host DNA double strand breaks via non-homologous end joining, NHEJ. In contrast, our data strongly suggest that complex integration patterns are mediated by microhomology-mediated break-induced replication, MMBIR.

Furthermore, we show by ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq analysis that MCPyV preferably integrates in open chromatin and provide evidence that viral oncogene expression is driven by the viral promoter region, rather than transcription from juxtaposed host promoters. Taken together, our data explain the characteristics of MCPyV integration and may also provide a model for integration of other oncogenic DNA viruses such as papillomaviruses.

Author summaryIntegration of viral DNA into the host genome is a key event in the pathogenesis of many virus-induced cancers. One such cancer is Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a highly malignant tumor that harbors monoclonally integrated and replication-defective Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) genomes. Although MCPyV integration sites have been analyzed before, there is very little knowledge of the mechanisms that lead to mutagenesis and integration of viral genomes. We used multiple sequencing technologies and interrogation of chromatin states to perform a comprehensive characterization of MCPyV integration loci. This analysis allowed us to deduce the events that likely precede viral integration. We provide evidence that the mutations which result in the replication defective phenotype are acquired prior to integration and propose that the cellular DNA repair pathways non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) produce two principal MCPyV integration patterns (simple and complex, respectively). We show that, although MCPyV integrates predominantly in open chromatin regions, viral oncogene expression is independent of host promoters and driven by the viral promotor region. Our findings are important since they can explain the mechanisms of MCPyV integration. Furthermore, our model may also apply to papillomaviruses, another clinically important family of oncogenic DNA viruses.","NA"

ConclusionsBased on this first longitudinal study, the majority of children showed AR before 57 months and the degree of obesity at the age of 57 months had a close correlation with early AR or early weight during infancy.","NA"

However, at larger, macroscopic scales, glacier moss balls (sometimes called ""glacier mice"") can develop from impurities on ice surfaces and represent a relatively rare biological phenomenon. These ovoid-shaped conglomerations of dirt and moss are only found on some glacier surfaces and provide key habitats for invertebrate colonization. Yet, despite their development and presence being widely reported, no targeted studies of their movement and persistence across years have been conducted. This knowledge gap is particularly important when considering the degree to which glacier moss balls may represent viable, long-term biotic habitats on glaciers, perhaps complete with their own ecological succession dynamics. Here, we describe the movement and persistence of glacier moss balls on the Root Glacier in southcentral Alaska, USA. We show that glacier moss balls move an average of 2.5 cm per day in herd-like fashion, and their movements are positively correlated with glacier ablation. Surprisingly, the dominant moss ball movement direction does not align with the prevailing wind or downslope directions, nor with any dominant direction of solar radiation. After attaining a mature size, glacier moss balls persist for many years, likely in excess of 6 years. Finally, we observed moss ball formation on the Root Glacier to occur within a narrow, low albedo stripe downwind of a nunatuk, a potential key source of moss spores and/or fine-grained sediment that interact to promote their formation.","NA"

Since the current testing capacity by conventional PCR based methods is insufficient because of shortages of supplies such as RNA extraction kits and PCR reagents, alternative and/or complementary testing assays should be developed. Here, we exploit the potential of targeted mass spectrometry based proteomic technologies to solve the current issue of insufficient SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing capacity. We have assessed the limit of detection by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer for target tryptic peptides of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins from a sample of virus infected Vero cells. For Nucleocapsid protein the limit of detection was found to be in the mid-attomole range (0.9 x 10-12 g), which would theoretically correspond to approximately 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles, under the assumption that all viral proteins are assembled in macromolecular virus particles. Whether or not this sensitivity is sufficient to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient material such as swabs or body fluids largely depends on the amount of viral proteins present in such samples and is subject of further research. If yes, mass spectrometry based methods could serve as a complementary protein based diagnostic tool and further steps should be focused on sample preparation protocols and on improvements in sample throughput.","NA"

It was demonstrated in enveloped RNA viruses that PPxY motif recruits Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases and ultimately the ESCRT complex to enhance virus budding and release that means a high viral load, hence facilitating new infections. Note that PPxY motif is not present in proteins of SARS-CoV. This suggests that PPxY motif by its role in enhancing the viral load could explain why SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV.

While the pressure waves generated by FUS in this context have been extensively studied, the accompanying shear waves are often neglected due to the relatively high shear compliance of soft tissues. However, in bony structures such as the skull, acoustic pressure can also induce significant shear waves that could propagate outside the ultrasound focus. Here, we investigate wave propagation in the human cranium by means of a finite-element model that accounts for the anatomy, elasticity and viscoelasticity of the skull and brain. We show that, when a region on the frontal lobe is subjected to FUS, the skull acts as a wave guide for shear waves, resulting in their propagation to off-target structures such as the cochlea. This effect helps explain the off-target auditory responses observed during neuromodulation experiments and informs the development of mitigation and sham control strategies.","NA"

The local anti-tumour immune response is particularly important for patients with stage II where the tumour-draining lymph nodes have not yet succumbed to tumour spread. The lymph nodes allow for the expansion and release of B cell compartments such as primary follicles and germinal centres. A variation in this anti-tumour immune response may influence the observed clinical heterogeneity in stage II patients.

AimThe aim of this study was to explore tumour-draining lymph node histomorphological changes and tumour pathological risk factors including the immunomodulatory microRNA-21 (miR-21) in a small cohort of stage II CRC.

MethodsA total of 23 stage II colorectal cancer patients were included. Tumour and normal mucosa samples were analysed for miR-21 expression levels and B-cell compartments were quantified from Haematoxylin and Eosin slides of lymph nodes. These measures were compared to clinicopathological risk factors such as perforation, bowel obstruction, T4 stage and high-grade.

ResultsWe observed greater follicle density in patients with a lower tumour T stage and higher germinal centre density in patients with higher pre-operative carcinoembryonic antigen levels. Trends were also detected between tumours with deficiency in mismatch repair proteins, lymphatic invasion and both the density and size of B-cell compartments. Lastly, elevated tumour miR-21 was associated with decreased follicle and germinal centre size.

ConclusionVariation in B-cell compartments of tumour-draining lymph nodes is associated with clinicopathological risk factors in stage II CRC patients.

What does this paper add to the literature?This study demonstrates the variability of tumour draining lymph node morphological features in stage II CRC patients. This provides new scope for biomarker discovery in stage II CRC patients which is a research priority for this patient group.","NA"

D. montana, which is generally found on higher latitudes and altitudes than D. flavomontana, was darker and more cold-tolerant than D. flavomontana. In D. montana only fly cold tolerance showed latitudinal variation, while in D. flavomontana both traits varied according to latitude and local climatic conditions, but showed no correlation with each other. We also examined the role of a circadian clock gene vrille and an insulin-signalling pathway gene Yolk protein 3 (Yp3) in the basal cold tolerance and cold acclimation ability of D. montana females using RNA interference. Silencing of vrille induced expression changes in the period, but not clock, and decreased flies basal cold tolerance and cold acclimation ability, while silencing of Yp3 affected only cold acclimation. Our study demonstrates that the dependence of insect cold tolerance on latitudinally varying factors and local climatic conditions may vary even between closely-related species. Furthermore, we propose that a functional circadian clock system plays an essential role both in insect basal cold tolerance and cold acclimation ability, and that Yp3 affects cold acclimation likely through its interactions with other genes in the insulin-signalling pathway.","NA"

The species has a north-south distribution of c. 2800 km, mostly on the eastern side of the Andes mountain range. Use of extended torpor occurs in the southernmost portion of the range, putting the species at risk of bat white-nose syndrome (WNS), a fungal disease responsible for massive population declines in North American bats. Here, we examined how geographic distance and topology would be reflected in the population structure of M. chiloensis along the majority of its range using a double digestion RAD-tag method. We sampled 66 individuals across the species range and discovered pronounced isolation-by-distance. Furthermore, and surprisingly, we found higher degrees of heterozygosity in the southernmost populations compared to the north. A coalescence analysis revealed that our populations may still not have reached secondary contact after the Last Glacial Maximum. As for the potential spread of pathogens, such as the fungus causing WNS, connectivity among populations was noticeably low, especially between the southern hibernatory populations in the Magallanes and Tierra del Fuego, and more northerly populations. This suggests the probability of geographic spread of the disease from the north through bat-to-bat contact to susceptible populations is low.

The strength of the stalk rind, commonly measured as rind penetrometer resistance (RPR), is an important contributor to stalk lodging resistance. To enhance RPR genetic architecture, we conducted selection mapping on populations developed by 15 cycles of divergent selection for high (C15-H) and low (C15-L) RPR. We also performed time-course transcriptome and metabolic analyses on developing stalks of high (Hrpr1) and low (Lrpr1) RPR inbred lines derived from the C15-H and C15-L populations, respectively. Divergent selection significantly altered allele frequencies at 3,656 and 3,412 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the C15-H and C15-L populations, respectively. While the majority of the SNPs under selection were unique, 110 SNPs were common in both populations indicating the fixation of alleles with alternative effects. Remarkably, preferential selection on the genomic regions associated with lignin and polysaccharide biosynthesis genes was observed in C15-H and C15-L populations, respectively. This observation was supported by higher lignification and lower extractability of cell wall-bound sugars in Hrpr1 compared to Lrpr1. Tricin, a monolignol important for incorporation of lignin in grass cell walls, emerged as a key determinant of the different cell wall properties of Hrpr1 and Lrpr1. Integration of selection mapping with transcriptomics and previous genetic studies on RPR identified 40 novel candidate genes including ZmMYB31, ZmNAC25, ZmMADS1, two PAL paralogues, two lichenases, ZmEXPA2, ZmIAA41, and Caleosin.

Methods and findingsWe excluded cases suspected of reinfection or contamination to analyze data from 200 subjects, 167 of which met microbiological criteria for delayed culture conversion, treatment failure or relapse. Using technical and biological replicate samples, we defined an allele frequency threshold attributable to in-host evolution. Of the 167 subjects with unsuccessful treatment outcome, 27 (16%) developed new resistance mutations between sampling with 20/27 (74%) occurring in patients with pre-existing antibiotic resistance. Low abundance resistance variants at a purity of [&ge;]19% in the first isolate predicts fixation of these variants in the subsequent sample with 27.0% sensitivity and 95.8% specificity. We identify significant in-host variation in seven genes associated with antibiotic resistance and twenty other genes, including metabolic genes and genes known to modulate host innate immunity by interacting with TLR2.

However, the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and intermediate hosts that facilitate its transmission to humans remain unknown. The interaction of coronavirus with its host receptor is a key genetic determinant of host range and cross-species transmission. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter host cells in a species-dependent manner. It has been shown that human, palm civet, pig and bat ACE2 can support virus entry, while the murine ortholog cannot. In this study, we characterized the ability of ACE2 from diverse species to support viral entry. We found that ACE2 is expressed in a wide range of species, with especially high conservation in mammals. By analyzing amino acid residues of ACE2 critical for virus entry, based on structure of SARS-CoV spike protein interaction with human, bat, palm civet, pig and ferret ACE2, we identified approximately eighty ACE2 proteins from mammals that could potentially mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Functional assays showed that 44 of these mammalian ACE2 orthologs, including those of domestic animals, pets, livestock, and animals commonly found in zoos and aquaria, could bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. In contrast, New World monkey ACE2 orthologs could not bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. We further identified the genetic determinant of New World monkey ACE2 that restricts viral entry using genetic and functional analyses. In summary, our study demonstrates that ACE2 from a remarkably broad range of species can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry. These findings highlight a potentially broad host tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be distributed much more widely than previously recognized, underscoring the necessity to monitor susceptible hosts to prevent future outbreaks.","NA"

Despite clear evidence that the brain tracks speech at low frequencies (~1 Hz), it is not well understood what linguistic information gives rise to this rhythm. Here, we harness linguistic theory to draw attention to Intonation Units (IUs), a fundamental prosodic unit of human language, and characterize their temporal structure as captured in the speech envelope, an acoustic representation relevant to the neural processing of speech.

IUs are defined by a specific pattern of syllable delivery, together with resets in pitch and articulatory force. Linguistic studies of spontaneous speech indicate that this prosodic segmentation paces new information in language use across diverse languages. Therefore, IUs provide a universal structural cue for the cognitive dynamics of speech production and comprehension.

We study the relation between IUs and periodicities in the speech envelope, applying methods from investigations of neural synchronization. Our sample includes recordings from every-day speech contexts of over 100 speakers and six languages. We find that sequences of IUs form a consistent low-frequency rhythm and constitute a significant periodic cue within the speech envelope.

In addition, by modelling responses to bilateral visual field stimulation in the overlap zone, we found evidence in favor of discrete unilateral receptive fields, suggesting a conservative pattern of spatial selectivity in the presence of abnormal retinal input.

Twenty patients with PD and 10 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited as participants. We recorded VEF, AEF, and SEF, collected clinical characteristics, performed physical examinations, and administered 10 cognitive tests. We investigated differences in the latencies of the evoked fields between patients with PD and HCs. We also evaluated the correlation of the latencies with motor symptoms and cognitive functioning. There were significant differences between the two groups in 6 of the cognitive tests, all of which suggested mild cognitive impairment in patients with PD. The latencies of the VEF N75m, P100m, N145m, AEF P50m, P100m, and SEF P60m components were greater in the patients with PD than in the HCs. The latencies mainly correlated with medication and motor symptoms, less so with cognitive tests, with some elements of the correlations remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. In conclusion, the latencies of the VEF, AEF, and SEF were greater in PD patients than in HCs and were mainly correlated with medication and motor symptoms rather than cognitive functioning. Findings from this study suggest that evoked fields may reflect basal ganglia functioning and are candidates for assessing motor symptoms or the therapeutic effects of medication in patients with PD.","NA"

It is widely believed that cannabis, or its main psychoactive component {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), impairs working memory, i.e., the ability to temporarily hold information in mind. However, our review of the literature yielded surprisingly little empirical support for an effect of THC or cannabis on working memory. We thus conducted a study with 3 main goals: (1) quantify the effect of THC on visual working memory in a well-powered sample (2) test the potential role of cognitive effects (mind wandering and metacognition) in disrupting working memory, and (3) demonstrate how insufficient sample size and task duration reduce the likelihood of detecting a drug effect. We conducted two double-blind, randomized crossover experiments in which healthy adults (N=23, 23) performed a reliable and validated visual working memory task (the ""Discrete Whole-Report task"", 90 trials) after administration of THC (7.5 and/or 15 mg oral) or placebo. We also assessed self-reported  mind wandering (Exp 1) and metacognitive accuracy about ongoing task performance (Exp 2). THC impaired working memory performance (d = .65), increased mind wandering (Exp 1), and decreased metacognitive accuracy about task performance (Exp 2). Thus, our findings indicate that THC does impair visual working memory, and that this impairment may be related to both increased mind-wandering and decreased monitoring of task performance. Finally, we used a down-sampling procedure to illustrate the effects of task length and sample size on power to detect the acute effect of THC on working memory.","NA"

Right lower lobes of these lungs were imaged at the TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source synchrotron facility at a voxel size of 1.48 {micro}m. Individual acini (N=268) were segmented from the 3D data by closing the airways ways at the transition point from conducting to gas exchanging airways. Acinar development was followed by estimating the individual acinar volume, complexity, and number of alveoli.

The mean volume of the acini increases 23 times during the observed timeframe. The coefficients of variation dropped from 1.26 to 0.49 and the difference between the mean volumes of the fraction of the 20 % smallest to the 20 % largest acini decreased from a factor of 27.26 (day 4) to a factor of 4.07 (day 60), i.e. shows a smaller dispersion at later time points. This indicates that the acinar volumes show a very large variation at early timepoints and homogenize during maturation of the lung. Our approach is well suited to follow acinar development and to acquire stereologically correct data in a time-efficient manner. We found that the newly formed acini show a large size distribution which is reduced by a factor of 7 until adulthood. Most likely this leads to a more homogeneous ventilation in the lung.","NA"

G.; Hong, T.","Tian Hong","University of Tennessee Knoxville","2020-04-23",1,"cc_by","new results","systems biology","Light-entrained circadian clocks confer rhythmic dynamics of cellular and molecular activities to animals and plants. These intrinsic clocks allow stable anticipations to light-dark (diel) cycles. Many genes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana are regulated by diel cycles via pathways independent of the clock, suggesting that the integration of circadian and light signals is important for the fitness of plants. Previous studies of light-clock signal integrations have focused on moderate phase adjustment of the two signals. However, dynamical features of integrations across a broad range of phases remain elusive. We recently found that phosphorylation of RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN OF THE SMALL SUBUNIT 6 (RPS6 or eS6), a ubiquitous post-translational modification across kingdoms, is influenced by the circadian clock and the light-dark (diel) cycle in an opposite manner. In order to understand this striking phenomenon and its underlying information processing capabilities, we built a mathematical model for the eS6-P control circuit. We found that the dynamics of eS6-P can be explained by a feedforward circuit with inputs from both circadian and diel cycles. Furthermore, the early-day response of this circuit with dual rhythmic inputs is sensitive to the changes in daylength, including both transient and gradual changes observed in realistic light intervals across a year, due to weather and seasons. By analyzing published gene expression data, we found that the dynamics produced by the eS6-P control circuit can be observed in the expression profiles of a large number of genes. Our work provides mechanistic insights into the complex dynamics of a ribosomal protein, and it proposes a previously underappreciated function of the circadian clock which not only prepares organisms for normal diel cycles but also helps to detect both transient and seasonal changes with a predictive power.

Statement of SignificanceCircadian clocks provide rhythmic dynamics that anticipate light-dark cycles in a consistent fashion. Many genes in plants are controlled by both the circadian clock and light-dark cycles through independent pathways. We built a mathematical model to understand a recent observation that circadian rhythms and light-dark cycles drive the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein eS6 with opposing phases. We found that this phenomenon is governed by a feedforward circuit involving clock and light-dark cycles. With realistic photoperiod data, we show that the circuit can detect both transient (weather) and long-term (seasonal) daylength variations at the beginning of a day, suggesting rich dynamics arising from clock-light signal integration and a new property of the circadian clock in robustly detecting changes in light conditions.","NA"

Its efficient transmission and range of disease severity raise questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptor interactions. ACE2 is a host ectopeptidase and the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Receptor expression on the cell surface facilitates viral binding and entry. However, reports of the abundance and distribution of ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract are limited and conflicting.

ObjectivesTo determine ACE2 expression in the human respiratory tract and its association with demographic and clinical characteristics.

MethodsHere, we systematically examined human upper and lower respiratory tract cells using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to determine where the receptor is expressed.

Measurements and main resultsOur results reveal that ACE2 expression is highest within the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development, respectively. In the lung parenchyma where severe disease occurs, ACE2 was found on the apical surface of a small subset of alveolar type II cells. We saw no increase of receptor expression in the presence of known risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019.

ConclusionsThe mapping of ACE2 to specific anatomical regions and to particular cell types in the respiratory tract will help guide future studies and provide molecular targets for antiviral therapies.","NA"

To better understand how extrinsic cues interact with intrinsic temporal programs to contribute to temporal patterning, we studied the Drosophila mushroom body neural progenitors (neuroblasts). Each of these four neuroblasts divides ~250 times to sequentially produce only three main neuronal types over the course of ~9 days of development: {gamma}, followed by {beta}, and finally {beta} neurons. The intrinsic temporal clock is composed of two RNA-binding proteins, IGF-II mRNA binding protein (Imp) and Syncrip (Syp), that are expressed in opposing temporal gradients. Activin signaling affects the production of {beta} neurons but whether and how this extrinsic cue interacts with the intrinsic temporal program was not known. We show that the Activin ligand Myoglianin produced from glia regulates the levels of the intrinsic temporal factor Imp in mushroom body neuroblasts. In neuroblasts mutant for the Activin signaling receptor baboon, Imp levels are higher than normal during the {beta} temporal window, leading to the specific loss of the {beta} neurons. The intrinsic temporal clock still progresses but with a delay, skipping the {beta} window without affecting the total number of neurons produced: The number of {gamma} neurons increases, {beta} disappear and the number of {beta} neurons decreases. Our results illustrate that an extrinsic cue modifies an intrinsic temporal program to increase neuronal diversity.","NA"

SARS-CoV-2 promotes fatal chronic respiratory disease followed by multiple organ failure which ultimately puts an end to human life. No proven vaccine for n-CoV is available till date in spite of significant research efforts worldwide. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has reached to a consensus that the virus SARS-CoV-2 is highly genetically similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak of 2003. It has been reported that SARS-CoV has [~]89% genetic similarities with n-CoV. With this hypothesis, the current work focuses on the identification of spreader nodes in SARS-CoV protein interaction network. Various network characteristics like edge ratio, neighborhood density and node weight have been explored for defining a new feature spreadability index by virtue of which spreader nodes and edges are identified. The selected top spreader nodes having high spreadability index have been also validated by Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) disease model. Initially, the proposed method is applied on a synthetic protein interaction network followed by SARS-CoV-human protein interaction network. Hence, key spreader nodes and edges (ranked edges) are unmasked in SARS-CoV proteins and its connected level 1 and level 2 human proteins. The new network attribute spreadability index along with generated SIS values of selected top spreader nodes when compared with the other network centrality based methodologies like Degree centrality (DC), Closeness centrality (CC), Local average centrality (LAC) and Betweeness centrality (BC) is found to perform relatively better than the existing-state-of-art.","NA"

We measured body size (SVL), tail length and head dimensions in 391 specimens, and examined variation in biometric traits with respect to allometry, sex and colour morph. In addition, we analysed head shape variation by recording the position of 29 landmarks in 123 specimens and establishing a low-error protocol for implementing geometric morphometrics to European vipers. All head dimensions exhibited significant allometry, while sexual differences occurred for SVL, relative tail length and snout height. After considering size effects, we found significant differences in body proportions between the sexes and across colour morphs, which suggests an important influence of lowland and montane habitats in shaping morphological variation. By contrast, head shape did not exhibit significant variation across sexes or colour morphs. Instead it was mainly associated to allometric variation, where the supraocular and the rear regions of the head were the areas that varied the most throughout growth and across individuals. Overall, this study provides a thorough description of morphological variability in Vipera seoanei and highlights the relevance of combining different tools (i.e. linear and geometric morphometrics) and analyses to evaluate the relative contribution of different factors in shaping intraspecific variation.","NA"

Here, to elucidate the actions of SFs and their contributions to RA pathogenesis, SFs, stimulated with 8 proinflammatory cytokines, were analyzed using genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic approaches. SFs exposed to synergistically acting cytokines produced markedly higher levels of pathogenic molecules, including CD40 whose expression was significantly affected by a RA risk SNP (rs6074022). Upon chromatin remodeling in activated SFs, RA risk loci were enriched in clusters of enhancers (super-enhancers; SEs) induced by synergistic proinflammatory cytokines. A RA risk SNP (rs28411362), located in a SE under synergistically acting cytokines, formed three-dimensional contact with the promoter of MTF1 gene, whose binding motif showed significant enrichment in stimulation specific-SEs. Consistently, inhibition of MTF1 suppressed cytokine and chemokine production from SFs and ameliorated mice model of arthritis.

Indeed, inhibition of PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), a known link between ER stress and ATF4, and calcineurin, a calcium-dependent regulator of NFAT, synergistically suppress HIV reactivation induced by FOXO1 inhibition. Thus, our studies uncover a novel link between FOXO1, ER stress, and HIV infection that could be therapeutically exploited to selectively reverse T-cell quiescence and reduce the size of the latent viral reservoir.","NA"

There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs. Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. A quick way to test compounds with potential antiviral activity is through drug repurposing. Numerous drugs are already approved for human use and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to fast-track to clinical studies in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data on the antiviral activity of 20 FDA approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that also inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that 17 of these inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at a range of IC50 values at non-cytotoxic concentrations. We directly follow up with seven of these to demonstrate all are capable of inhibiting infectious SARS-CoV-2 production. Moreover, we have evaluated two of these, chloroquine and chlorpromazine, in vivo using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV model and found both drugs protect mice from clinical disease.","NA"

Numerous studies have focused on evaluating the potential of different densoviruses species as biological control agent. However, knowledge on the extent of inter- and intra-specific variations in the susceptibility of Aedes mosquitoes to infection by different densoviruses remains insufficient. In this study, we compared infection and mortality rates induced by the Aedes albopictus densovirus 2 in different strains of Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The two Aedes species were different in terms of susceptibility to viral infection. Under laboratory conditions, Aedes albopictus densovirus 2 appeared more virulent for the different strains of Aedes aegypti tested than for those of Aedes albopictus. In addition, we also found significant intra-specific variation in infection and mortality rates. Thus, although even if Aedes albopictus densoviruses could be powerful biocontrol agents used in the management of urban Aedes populations, our results also call into question the use of single viral isolate as biocontrol agents.","NA"

These viral elements contribute new transcriptional control elements and new protein encoding genes, and their refinement through evolution can generate novel physiological functions for the host. EnvP(b)1 is an endogenous retroviral envelope gene found in human and other primate genomes. We show that EnvP(b)1 arose very early in the evolution of primates, i.e. at least 40-47 million years ago, but has nevertheless retained its ability to fuse primate cells. We have detected similar sequences in the genome of a lemur species, suggesting that a progenitor virus may have circulated 55+ million years ago. We demonstrate that EnvP(b)1 protein is expressed in multiple human tissues and is fully processed, rendering it competent to fuse cells. This activated fusogen is expressed in multiple healthy human tissues and is under purifying selection, suggesting that its expression is selectively advantageous. We determined a structure of the inferred receptor binding domain of human EnvP(b)1, revealing close structural similarities between this Env protein and those of currently circulating leukemia viruses, despite poor sequence conservation. This observation highlights a common scaffold from which novel receptor binding specificities have evolved. The evolutionary plasticity of this domain may underlie the diversity of related Envs in circulating viruses and coopted elements alike. The function of EnvP(b)1 in primates remains unknown.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTOrganisms can access genetic and functional novelty by capturing viral elements within their genomes, where they can evolve to drive new cellular or organismal processes. We demonstrate that a retrovirus envelope gene, EnvP(b)1, has been maintained as a functional protein for 40 to [&ge;]55 million years and is expressed as a protein in multiple healthy human tissues. We believe it has an unknown function in primates. We determined the structure of its inferred receptor binding domain and compared it with the same domain in modern viruses. We find a common conserved architecture that underlies the varied receptor binding activity of divergent Env genes. The modularity and versatility of this domain may underpin the evolutionary success of this clade of fusogens.","NA"

However, little is known about such a core virome in laboratory colonies and if it is present across different developmental stages. In this study, we compared the viromes in eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes collected from the field as well as from a lab colony. The virome in lab-derived Ae. albopictus is very stable across all stages, consistent with a vertical transmission route of these viruses, forming a ""vertically transmitted core virome"". The different stages of field collected Ae. albopictus mosquitoes also contains this stable vertically transmitted core virome as well as another set of viruses shared by mosquitoes across different stages, which might be an ""environment derived core virome"". Both these vertically and environmentally transmitted core viromes in Ae. albopictus deserve more attention with respect to their effects on vector competence for important medically relevant arboviruses. To further study this core set of ISVs, we screened 46 publically available SRA viral metagenomic dataset of mosquitoes belonging to the genus Aedes. Some of the identified core ISVs are identified in the majority of SRAs. In addition, a novel virus, Aedes phasmavirus, is found to be distantly related to Yongsan bunyavirus 1, and the genomes of the core virus Phasi Charoen-like phasivirus is highly prevalent in the majority of the tested samples, with nucleotide identities ranging from 94% to 99%.

Here, we show that productive SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of mice is limited and restricted by early type I interferon responses. In contrast, we show that Syrian hamsters are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2. In wild-type hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers bronchopneumonia and a strong inflammatory response in the lungs with neutrophil infiltration and edema. We further assess SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology in hamsters by micro-CT alike used in clinical practice. Finally, we identify an exuberant innate response as key player in immune pathogenesis, in which STAT2 signaling plays a double-edged role, driving severe lung injury on the one hand, yet restricting systemic virus dissemination on the other.

We discovered recently that a member of this family, thiostrepton, has activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii under iron-limiting conditions. Thiostrepton uses pyoverdine siderophore receptors to cross the outer membrane, and combining thiostrepton with an iron chelator yielded remarkable synergy, significantly reducing the minimal inhibitory concentration. These results led to the hypothesis that other thiopeptides could also inhibit growth by using siderophore receptors to gain access to the cell. Here, we screened six thiopeptides for synergy with the iron chelator deferasirox against P. aeruginosa and a mutant lacking the pyoverdine receptors FpvA and FpvB. Our findings suggest that thiopeptides such as thiocillin cross the outer membrane using FoxA, the ferrioxamine siderophore receptor. Other structurally related thiopeptides did not inhibit growth of P. aeruginosa, but had greater potency against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than thiostrepton and related thiopeptides.

Mitochondrial metabolism of glucose is essential for the initiation of insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. Whether mitochondrial ultra-structure, and the proteins controlling fission and fusion, are important for glucose recognition are unclear. Mitochondrial fusion is supported by proteins including mitofusin 1 (MFN1), mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and optic atrophy (OPA1), and fission by dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). Here, we generated mice with beta cell-selective, adult-restricted deletion of Mfn1 and Mfn2 ({beta}Mfn1/2-KO), and explored the impact on insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in vivo and in vitro.

Materials and methodsC57BL/6J mice bearing Mfn1 and Mfn2 alleles with loxP sites, were crossed to animals carrying an inducible Cre recombinase at the Pdx1 locus (PdxCreERT). Isolated islets were used for live beta cell fluorescence imaging of cytosolic (Cal-520) or mitochondrial (Pericam) free Ca2+ concentration and membrane potential (TMRE). Mitochondrial network characteristics were quantified using super resolution fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Beta cell-beta cell connectivity was assessed using the Pearson (R) analysis and Monte Carlo simulation in intact mouse islets. Intravital imaging was performed in mice injected with an adeno-associated virus to express the cytosolic Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6s selectively in beta cells and TMRM to visualise mitochondria using multiphoton microscopy.

Results{beta}Mfn1/2-KO mice displayed higher fasting glycaemia than control littermates at 14 weeks (8.6 vs 6.4 mmol/L, p>0.05) and a >five-fold decrease in plasma insulin post-intraperitoneal glucose injection (5-15 min, p<0.0001). Mitochondrial length, and glucose-induced Ca2+ accumulation, mitochondrial hyperpolarisation and beta cell connectivity were all significantly reduced in {beta}Mfn1/2-KO mouse islets. Examined by intravital imaging of the exteriorised pancreas, antiparallel changes in cytosolic Ca2+ and mitochondrial membrane potential, observed in control animals in vivo, were suppressed after Mfn1/2 deletion.

ConclusionMitochondrial fusion and fission cycles are essential in the beta cell to maintain normal mitochondrial bioenergetics and glucose sensing both in vitro and in the living mouse. Such cycles may be disrupted in some forms of diabetes to impair mitochondrial function and, consequently, insulin secretion.","NA"

We found that hippocampal neurons signaled both mnemonic information representing the retrieved location and perceptual information representing the external circumstance. The two signals were combined at a single-neuron level to construct goal-directed information by three sequentially occurring neuronal operations (e.g., convergence, transference, targeting) in the hippocampus.

Here, we evaluated functional network architecture, cognitive performance, and brain-behavior relationships in pediatric brain tumor patients. Patients ages 4-18 years old with diagnosis of a brain tumor underwent awake resting state fMRI during regularly scheduled clinical visits and were tested with the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery. We observed that functional network organization was significantly altered in patients compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, with the integrity of the dorsal attention network particularly affected. Moreover, patients demonstrated significant impairments in multiple domains of cognitive performance, including attention. Finally, a significant amount of variance of age-adjusted total composite scores from the Toolbox was explained by changes in segregation between the dorsal attention and default mode networks.

Animal models of drug self-administration are essential in this context. Here, we compared in male rats two cocaine self-administration procedures that differ in the extent to which they evoke addiction-like behaviours. We measured both incentive motivation for cocaine using progressive ratio procedures, and cocaine-induced c-fos mRNA expression, a marker of neuronal activity. Rats self-administered intravenous cocaine (0.25 mg/kg/infusion) for seven daily 6-hour sessions. One group had intermittent access (IntA; 6 minutes ON, 26 minutes OFF x 12) to rapid infusions (delivered over 5 seconds). This models the temporal kinetics of human cocaine use and produces robust addiction-like behaviour. The other group had Long access (LgA) to slower infusions (90 seconds). This produces high levels of intake without promoting robust addiction-like behaviour. LgA-90s rats took twice as much cocaine as IntA-5s rats did, but IntA-5s rats showed greater incentive motivation for the drug. Following a final self-administration session, we quantified c-fos mRNA expression in corticostriatal regions. Compared to LgA-90s rats, IntA-5s rats had more cocaine-induced c-fos mRNA in the orbitofrontal and prelimbic cortices and the caudate-putamen. Thus, a cocaine self-administration procedure (intermittent intake of rapid infusions) that promotes increased incentive motivation for the drug also enhances cocaine-induced gene regulation in corticostriatal regions. This suggests that increased drug-induced recruitment of these regions could contribute to the neural and behavioural plasticity underlying the transition to addiction.","NA"

Subsequently, a group of participants is stimulated with the new paradigm, while brain activity is assessed, e.g. with EEG/MEG. The measured data are then pre-processed and finally contrasted according to the different stimulus conditions. In this way, only a limited number of analyses and hypothesis tests can be performed, while for alternative or further analyses, completely new paradigms usually need to be designed. This traditional approach is necessarily data-limited, and the cost-benefit ratio is therefore rather poor.

However, sidewinding, often associated with sandy deserts, cuts a broad path through the environment that may increase the vulnerability to obstacles. Our prior work demonstrated that sidewinding can be represented as a pair of orthogonal body waves (vertical and horizontal) that can be independently modulated to achieve high maneuverability and incline ascent, suggesting that sidewinders may also use template modulations to negotiate obstacles. To test this hypothesis, we recorded overhead video of four sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) crossing a line of vertical pegs placed in the substrate. Snakes used three methods to traverse the obstacles: a Propagate Through behavior in which the lifted moving portion of the snake was deformed around the peg and dragged through as the snake continued sidewinding (115/160 runs), Reversal turns that reorient the snake entirely (35/160), or switching to Concertina locomotion (10/160). The Propagate-Through response was only used if the anterior-most region of static contact would propagate along a path anterior to the peg, or if a new region of static contact could be formed near the head to satisfy this condition; otherwise, snakes could only use Reversal Turns or switch to Concertina locomotion. Reversal Turns allowed the snake to re-orient and either escape without further peg contact or resorting to Propagate Through. We developed an algorithm to reproduce the Propagate Through behavior in a robotic model using a modulation of the two-wave template. This range of behavioral strategies provides sidewinders with a versatile range of options for effectively negotiating obstacles in their natural habitat, as well as provide insights into the design and control of robotic systems dealing with heterogeneous habitats.","NA"

Its N-half contains most of the prolines and all of the anionic residues while the C-half most of the glycines and cationic residues. MD simulations, first validated by SAXS and secondary chemical shift data, found scant -helices or {beta}-strands but considerable propensity for polyproline II (PPII) torsion angles. Importantly, several blocks of residues (e.g., 11-29) emerge as ""correlated segments"", identified by frequent formation of PPII stretches, salt bridges, cation-{pi} interactions, and sidechain-backbone hydrogen bonds. NMR relaxation experiments showed non-uniform transverse relaxation rates (R2s) and nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) along the sequence (e.g., high R2s and NOEs for residues 11-14 and 23-28). MD simulations further revealed that the extent of segmental correlation is sequence-dependent: segments where internal interactions are more prevalent manifest elevated ""collective"" motions on the 5-10 ns timescale and suppressed local motions on the sub-ns timescale. Amide proton exchange rates provides corroboration, with residues in the most correlated segment exhibiting the highest protection factors.

In laboratory experiments, competing E. coli strains readily coexist in the presence of S. enterica, despite differences in their competitive abilities. We use ecological modeling to demonstrate that a shared mutualist can create temporary resource niche differentiation by limiting growth rates, even if yield is set by a resource external to a mutualism. This mechanism can extend to maintain multiple competing partner species.

Most research on the latter comes from studies on the influence of different agricultural types within a single ecosystem with far less study on how the natural ecosystem context shapes the response of biodiversity to agricultural production. We used citizen science data from agricultural areas in Canadas Eastern Hardwood-Boreal (forest ecosystem, n=108 landscapes) and Prairie Pothole (prairie ecosystem, n=99) regions to examine how ecosystem context shapes the response of avian species diversity, functional diversity and abundance to the amount of arable crop and pastoral agriculture at landscape scales. Avian surveys were conducted along 8km transects of Breeding Bird Survey routes with land cover assembled within a 20km2 landscape around each transect. The amount of agriculture at which species diversity peaked differed between the forest (15%) and prairie (51%) ecosystems, indicating that fewer species tolerated the expansion of agriculture in the former. In both ecosystems, functional diversity initially increased with agriculture and peaked at higher amounts (forest: 42%, prairie: 77%) than species diversity suggesting that functional redundancy was lost first as agriculture increased. Species turnover with increasing agriculture was primarily among functional groups in forest where a shift from a low to a high agriculture landscape led to a decline in the percent of the community represented by Neotropical migrants, insectivores, upper foliage gleaners and bark foragers, and an increase in the percent of the community represented by short-distance migrants, granivores, omnivores and ground gleaners. There were few distinct shifts in the percent of the community represented by different functional groups in the prairie ecosystem. Total abundance was the least sensitive measure examined in both ecosystems and indicated that species losses with agriculture are likely followed by numerical compensation from agriculture tolerant species. Our results highlight the importance of ecosystem context for understanding how biodiversity is affected by agricultural production with declines in diversity occurring at lower agricultural extents in ecosystems with lower similarity between natural and agricultural land covers. These findings allow for more specific conservation recommendations including managing for species intolerant to agriculture in prairie ecosystems and limiting the expansion of high contrast agriculture and the loss of semi-natural habitat, such as hedge rows, in historically forested ecosystems.","NA"

This secondary facultative endosymbiont is not necessary for the survival of its hosts but can infect certain individuals or even whole populations. Its infection in aphids is often associated with protection against parasitoid wasps. This protective phenotype has actually been linked to the infection of the symbiont strain with an APSE, which carries a toxin cassette that varies among so-called ""types"". In the present work, we seek to expand our understanding of the diversity of APSE phages as well as the relations of their Hamiltonella hosts. For this, we assembled and annotated the full genomes of 16 APSE phages infecting Hamiltonella symbionts across 10 insect species. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses suggest that recombination has occurred repeatedly among lineages. Comparative genomics of the phage genomes revealed two variable regions that are useful for phage typing. Additionally, we find that mobile elements could play a role in the acquisition of new genes in the toxin cassette. Altogether, we provide an unprecedented view of APSE diversity and their genome evolution across aphids. This genomic investigation will provide a valuable resource for the design and interpretation of experiments aiming at understanding the protective phenotype these phages confer to their insect hosts.","NA"

Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being actively developed by research groups around the world. The surface S (spike) protein and the highly expressed internal N (nucleocapsid) protein of SARS-CoV-2 are widely considered as promising candidates for vaccines. In order to guide the design of an effective vaccine, we need experimental data on these potential epitope candidates. In this study, we mapped the immunodominant (ID) sites of S protein using sera samples collected from recently discharged COVID-19 patients.

We used epitope mapping to determine the landscape of ID sites of S protein, which identified nine linearized B cell ID sites. Four out of the nine ID sites were found in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Further analysis showed that these ID sites are potential high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding sites. Peptides containing two out of the nine sites were tested as vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model.

The horizon on cell division variants is expanded here by advancing insights on the fascinating cell division modes found in the Apicomplexa, a key group of protozoan parasites. The Apicomplexa display remarkable variation in offspring number, whether karyokinesis follows each S/M-phase or not, and whether daughter cells bud in the cytoplasm or bud from the cortex. We find that the terminology used to describe the various manifestations of asexual apicomplexan cell division emphasizes either the number of offspring or site of budding, which are not directly comparable features and has led to confusion in the literature. Division modes have been primarily studied in two human pathogenic Apicomplexa, malaria-causing Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii, a major cause of opportunistic infections. Plasmodium spp. divide asexually by schizogony, producing multiple daughters per division round through a cortical budding process, though at several life-cycle nuclear amplifications are not followed by karyokinesis. T. gondii divides by endodyogeny producing two internally budding daughters per division round. Here we add to this diversity in replication mechanisms by considering the cattle parasite Babesia bigemina and the pig parasite Cystoisospora suis. B. bigemina produces two daughters per division round by a  binary fission mechanism whereas C. suis produces daughters through both endodyogeny and multiple internal budding known as endopolygeny. In addition, we provide new data from the causative agent of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM), Sarcocystis neurona, which also undergoes endopolygeny but differs from C. suis by maintaining a single multiploid nucleus. Overall, we operationally define two principally different division modes: internal budding found in cyst-forming Coccidia (comprising endodyogeny and two forms of endopolygeny) and external budding found in the other parasites studied (comprising the two forms of schizogony, binary fission and multiple fission). Progressive insights into the principles defining the molecular and cellular requirements for internal versus external budding, as well as variations encountered in sexual stages are discussed. The evolutionary pressures and mechanisms underlying apicomplexan cell division diversification carries relevance across Eukaryota.

Contribution to the FieldMechanisms of cell division vary dramatically across the Tree of Life, but the mechanistic basis has only been mapped for several model organisms. Here we present cell division strategies across Apicomplexa, a group of obligate intracellular parasites with significant impact on humans and domesticated animals. Asexual apicomplexan cell division is organized around assembly of daughter buds, but division forms differ in the cellular site of budding, number of offspring per division round, whether each S-phase follows karyokinesis and if mitotic rounds progress synchronously. This varies not just between parasites, but also between different life-cycle stages of a given species. We discuss the historical context of terminology describing division modes, which has led to confusion on how different modes relate to each other. Innovations in cell culture and genetics together with light microscopy advances have opened up cell biological studies that can shed light on this puzzle. We present new data for three division modes barely studied before. Together with existing data, we show how division modes are organized along phylogenetic lines and differentiate along external and internal budding mechanisms. We also discuss new insights into how the variations in division mode are regulated at the molecular level, and possess unique cell biological requirements.","NA"

Recent work suggests that alpha/beta desynchronization promotes information flow through the cortex, tracking the richness in detail of recovered memory representations. At the same time, as we age, memories become less vivid and detailed, which may be reflected in age-related reductions in alpha/beta desynchronization during retrieval. To understand age differences in the specificity of episodic memories, we investigated differences in alpha/beta desynchronization between younger (18-26 years, n = 31) and older (65-76 years, n = 28) adults during item recognition and lure discrimination.

Alpha/beta desynchronization increased linearly with the demand for memory specificity, i.e., the requirement to retrieve details for an accurate response, across retrieval situations (correct rejections < item recognition < lure discrimination). Stronger alpha/beta desynchronization was related to memory success, as indicated by reliable activation differences between correct and incorrect memory responses. In line with the assumption of a loss of mnemonic detail in older age, older adults had more difficulties than younger adults to discriminate lures from targets. Importantly, they also showed a reduced modulation of alpha/beta desynchronization across retrieval demands. Together, these results extend previous findings by demonstrating that alpha/beta desynchronization dissociates between item recognition and the retrieval of highly detailed memories as required in lure discrimination, and that age-related impairments in episodic retrieval are accompanied by attenuated modulations in the alpha/beta band. Thus, we provide novel findings suggesting that alpha/beta desynchronization tracks mnemonic specificity and that changes in these oscillatory mechanisms may underlie age-related declines in episodic memory.","NA"

To study how PRO affects stomatal closure, we performed RNAseq analysis of isolated guard cells and identified the ABA transporters ABA-IMPORTING TRANSPORTER1.1 (AIT1.1) and AIT1.2, also called in Arabidopsis NPF4.6, as upregulated by PRO. Tomato has four AIT1 genes, but only AIT1.1 and AIT1.2 were upregulated by PRO, and only AIT1.1 exhibited high expression in guard cells. Functional analysis of AIT1.1 in yeast confirmed its activity as an ABA transporter, possibly importer. CRISPR-Cas9-defrived ait1.1 mutant exhibited increased transpiration, larger stomatal aperture and reduced response to ABA. Moreover, ait1.1 suppressed the promoting effects of PRO on ABA-induced stomatal closure and gene expression in guard cells. The negative interaction between GA and ABA has been studied for many years in numerous plant species. These studies suggest that the crosstalk is mediated by changes in hormone biosynthesis and signaling. Our results suggest that it is also mediated by changes in hormone transport.

When preprocessing the raw dscRNA-seq data to generate a count matrix, care must be taken to account for the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. The sparsity of dscRNA-seq data, and the strong 3 sampling bias, makes it difficult to disambiguate cases where there is no uniquely mapping read to any of the candidate target genes.

ResultsWe introduce a Bayesian framework for information sharing across cells within a sample, or across multiple modalities of data using the same sample, to improve gene quantification estimates for dscRNA-seq data. We use an anchor-based approach to connect cells with similar gene expression patterns, and learn informative, empirical priors which we provide to alevins gene multi-mapping resolution algorithm. This improves the quantification estimates for genes with no uniquely mapping reads (i.e. when there is no unique intra-cellular information). We show our new model improves the per cell gene level estimates and provides a principled framework for information sharing across multiple modalities. We test our method on a combination of simulated and real datasets under various setups.

The transcriptional profile of remitters was compared with 21 antidepressant-induced gene expression profiles in five human cell lines available in the connectivity map database. Spearman correlation, Pearson correlation, and the Kolmogorov Smirnov test were used to determine the similarity between antidepressant-induced profiles and remitter profiles, subsequently calculating the average rank of antidepressants across the three methods and a p-value for each rank by using a permutation procedure. The drugs with the top ranks were those having high positive correlation with the expression profiles of remitters and they may have higher chances of efficacy in the tested patients.

In MCF7 (breast cancer cell line), escitalopram had the highest average rank, with an average rank higher than expected by chance (p=0.0014). In A375 (human melanoma) and PC3 (prostate cancer) cell lines, escitalopram and citalopram emerged as the second highest ranked antidepressants, respectively (p=0.0310 and 0.0276, respectively).

However, due to various limitations in experiments, the RNA-seq data is missing in many samples while there exists high-quality of DNA methylation data. As DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification to regulate gene expression, it can be used to predict RNA-seq data. For this purpose, many methods have been developed. A common limitation of these methods is that they mainly focus on single cancer dataset, and do not fully utilize information from large pan-cancer dataset.

ResultsHere, we have developed a novel method to impute missing gene expression data from DNA methylation data through transfer learning-based neural network, namely TDimpute. In the method, the pan-cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was utilized for training a general model, which was then fine-tuned on the specific cancer dataset. By testing on 16 cancer datasets, we found that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy with 7%-11% increase under different missing rates. The imputed gene expression was further proved to be useful for downstream analyses, including the identification of both methylation-driving and prognosis-related genes, clustering analysis, and survival analysis on the TCGA dataset. More importantly, our method was indicated to be useful for general purpose by the independent test on the Wilms tumor dataset from the Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) project.

Here, we reveal that, in human neutrophils, Calcium-promoted Ras inactivator (CAPRI) locally controls the GPCR-stimulated Ras adaptation. Human neutrophils lacking CAPRI (caprikd) exhibit chemoattractant-induced non-adaptive Ras activation; significantly increased phosphorylation of AKT, GSK3/3{beta}, and cofilin; and excessive actin polymerization. caprikd cells display defective chemotaxis in response to high-concentration gradients but exhibit improved chemotaxis in low- or subsensitive-concentration gradients of various chemoattractants as a result of their enhanced sensitivity. Taken together, our data reveal that CAPRI controls GPCR activation-mediated Ras adaptation and lowers the sensitivity of human neutrophils so that they are able to chemotax through a higher concentration range of chemoattractant gradients.

Significance StatementNeutrophils provide first-line host defense by migrating through chemoattractant gradients to the sites of inflammation. Inappropriate recruitment and mis-regulated activation of neutrophils contribute to tissue damage and cause autoimmune and inflammatory disease. One fascinating feature of chemotactic neutrophils is their ability to migrate through an enormous concentration range of chemoattractant gradients (10-9 [~] 10-5 M) through ""adaptation,"" in which cells no longer respond to the present stimuli, but remain sensitive to stronger stimuli. The inhibitory mechanism largely remains elusive, although many molecules of the excitatory signaling pathway have been identified.

We found that cells that overexpressed cdk4 were able to reenter the cell cycle from a contact arrested quiescent state in a kinase-dependent fashion, consistent with the role of this kinase in G0-G1 phase exit.

Further mechanistic studies showed that knockdown of S1PR1 or S1PR3 reduced SR-B1 protein by inducing its degradation through deceasing Akt activity. Moreover, silencing of S1PR1 or S1PR3 suppressed SCARB1 mRNA expression by decreasing cellular cAMP levels. In conclusion, we provide evidence for an as yet unappreciated interaction, namely the regulation of SR-B1 abundance by S1PRs on both transcriptional and post-translational levels, suggesting that interactions of S1PRs and SR-B1 regulate signaling functions of HDL as well as uptake of lipoproteins in endothelial cells.","NA"

Yet, we know little about rate and genomic targets of cross-lineage gene transfer, and about its effects on the recipient organisms physiology and fitness. Here, we address these questions in a parallel evolution experiment with two Bacillus subtilis lineages of 7% sequence divergence. We observe rapid evolution of hybrid organisms: gene transfer swaps ~12% of the core genome in just 200 generations, and 60% of core genes are replaced in at least one population. By genomics, transcriptomics, fitness assays, and statistical modeling, we show that transfer generates adaptive evolution and functional alterations in hybrids. Specifically, our experiments reveal a strong, repeatable fitness increase of evolved populations in the stationary growth phase. By genomic analysis of the transfer statistics across replicate populations, we infer that selection on HGT has a broad genetic basis: 40% of the observed transfers are adaptive. At the level of functional gene networks, we find signatures of negative and positive selection, consistent with hybrid incompatibilities and adaptive evolution of network functions. Our results suggest that gene transfer navigates a complex cross-lineage fitness landscape, bridging epistatic barriers along multiple high-fitness paths.

Significance statementIn a parallel evolution experiment, we probe lateral gene transfer between two Bacillus subtilis lineages close to the species boundary. We show that laboratory evolution by horizontal gene transfer can rapidly generate hybrid organisms with broad genomic and functional alterations. By combining genomics, transcriptomics, fitness assays and statistical modeling, we map the selective effects underlying gene transfer. We show that transfer takes place under genome-wide positive and negative selection, generating a net fitness increase in hybrids. The evolutionary dynamics efficiently navigates this fitness landscape, finding viable paths with increasing fraction of transferred genes.","NA"

P.","David P Toczyski","University of California, San Francisco","2020-04-24",1,"cc_no","new results","genetics","The S. cerevisiae ISR1 gene encodes a putative kinase with no ascribed function. Here, we show that Isr1 acts as a negative regulator of the highly-conserved hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), which converts glucose into uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), the carbohydrate precursor to protein glycosylation, GPI-anchor formation, and chitin biosynthesis. Overexpression of ISR1 is lethal and, at lower levels, causes sensitivity to tunicamycin and resistance to calcofluor white, implying impaired protein glycosylation and reduced chitin deposition. Gfa1 is the first enzyme in the HBP and is conserved from bacteria and yeast to humans. The lethality caused by ISR1 overexpression is rescued by co-overexpression of GFA1 or exogenous glucosamine, which bypasses GFA1s essential function. Gfa1 is phosphorylated in an ISR1-dependent fashion and mutation of ISR1-dependent sites ameliorates the lethality associated with ISR1 overexpression. Isr1 contains a phosphodegron that is phosphorylated by Pho85 and subsequently ubiquitinated by the SCF-Cdc4 complex, largely confining Isr1 protein levels to the time of bud emergence. Mutation of this phosphodegron stabilizes Isr1 and recapitulates the overexpression phenotypes. As Pho85 is a cell cycle and nutrient responsive kinase, this tight regulation of Isr1 may serve to dynamically regulate flux through the HBP and modulate how the cells energy resources are converted into structural carbohydrates in response to changing cellular needs.

Author SummaryProtein phosphorylation is an essential regulatory mechanism that controls most cellular processes, integrating a variety of environmental signals to drive cellular growth. Yeast encode over 100 kinases, yet many remain poorly characterized. The S. cerevisiae gene ISR1 encodes a putative kinase with no ascribed function. Here, we show that ISR1 decreases the synthesis of a critical structural carbohydrate, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), by mediating inhibition of one of the enzymes responsible for its synthesis, Gfa1. UDP-GlcNAc is the precursor to protein glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, and chitin synthesis, the first two of which are essential and conserved in humans. Throughout the cell cycle, and in response to changing environmental conditions, the cell must balance its use of glucose for energy production and generation of these structural carbohydrates. Here we show that Isr1 is regulated by both cell cycle and nutrient changes, and is rapidly degraded in a phosphorylation dependent manner. Isr1-mediated inhibition of UDP-GlcNAc synthesis may serve as a mechanism of dynamically regulating how the cell utilizes glucose in response to its environment.","NA"

FUS has also been implicated in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) and genome maintenance. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown.

FUS-deficient cells exhibited alterations in the recruitment and retention of DSBR factors BRCA1 and 53BP1 but were not overtly sensitive to genotoxins. FUS-deficient cells exhibited reduced proliferative potential that correlated with reduced replication fork speed, diminished loading of pre-replication complexes, and attenuated expression of S-phase associated genes. FUS interacted with replisome components, including lagging strand synthesis factors, but did not translocate with active replication forks.

It is widely accepted, however, that membrane voltage potentiates aminoglycoside activity, which is ascribed to voltage dependent drug uptake. In this paper, we measured the single cell response of Escherichia coli treated with aminoglycosides and discovered that the bactericidal action arises not from the downstream effects of voltage dependent drug uptake, but rather directly from dysregulated membrane potential. In the absence of voltage, aminoglycosides are taken into cells and exert bacteriostatic effects by inhibiting translation. However, cell killing was immediate upon re-polarization. The hyperpolarization arose from altered ATP flux, which induced a reversal of the F1Fo-ATPase to hydrolyze ATP and generated the deleterious voltage. Heterologous expression of an ATPase inhibitor from Salmonella completely eliminated bactericidal activity, while loss of the F-ATPase significantly reduced the electrophysiological response to aminoglycosides. Our data support a model of voltage induced death, which could be resolved in real-time at the single cell level, and separates the mechanisms of aminoglycoside bacteriostasis and bactericide in E. coli.","NA"

MethodsTransplanted liver samples were collected and divided into three groups: the optimal graft (OG) group, early allograft dysfunction (EAD) group, and primary nonfunction (PNF) group. iTRAQ comparative quantitative proteomic analysis and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) verification was performed.

ResultsMore than 160 differentially expressed proteins were detected in the PNF group, compared to 54 and 36 proteins in the EAD and OG groups respectively. Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) was found as differentially expressed in both cold preserved and reperfused liver. Serum L-FABP level in donors was higher in the PNF and EAD groups than in the OG group. A lower tissue expression of L-FABP was observed in the PNF groups than other groups after reperfusion, indicating incompetent liver donor quality. In mouse ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) model, the serum levels and tissue expression of L-FABP corresponded to the ALT variation curve.

Here we demonstrate that Mask negatively regulates MT stability and maintains a balanced MT length and architecture in both fly larval muscles and motor neurons. In larval muscles, loss of mask increases MT length, and altering mask genetically modifies the Tau-induced MT fragmentation. In motor neurons, loss of mask function reduces the number of End-Binding Protein 1 (EB1)-positive MT plus-ends in the axons and results in overexpansion of the presynaptic terminal at larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). mask shows strong genetic interaction with stathmin (stai), a neuronal modulator of MT dynamics, in regulation of axon transportation and synaptic terminal stability. The structure/function analysis on Mask suggests that Masks action in regulating MT stability does not depend on the nucleotide-binding function of its KH domain. Furthermore, through a proteomic approach, we found that Mask physically interacts with Jupiter, an MT stabilizing factor. The MT localization of Jupiter in the axons inversely correlates with Mask levels, suggesting that Mask may modulate MT stability by inhibiting the association of Jupiter to MTs.

Author SummaryMicrotubules (MT) are part of the cytoskeleton of the cells that provides essential structural basis for critical processes and functions of the cells. A complex factors are required to orchestrate the assembly and disassembly of MT. Here we identified Mask as a novel regulator for MT dynamics in fruit flies. Mask negatively regulates MT stability. It shows prominent interplay with two important modulators of MT, Tau and Stathmin (Stai), both genes are linked to human neurodegenerative disorders. These findings not only support the role of Mask as a novel microtubule regulator, but also provide foundation to explore future therapeutic strategies in mitigating deficit related to dysfunction of Tau and Stathmin. Our further analysis on Mask protein demonstrate that Mask can physically interacts with another MT stabilizing factor named Jupiter. Jupiter can bind to MT, but its localization to the MTs in the axons is negatively affected by Mask, implying a possible underlying mechanism that Mask may modulate MT stability by inhibiting the association of Jupiter to MTs.","NA"

These actions are purported to occur through ANSs modulation of the prefrontal cortex, with parasympathetic activity during wake associated with working memory ability (WM). Compared with wake, sleep is a period with substantially greater parasympathetic tone. Recent work has reported that sleep may also contribute to improvement in WM. Here, we examined the role of cardiac parasympathetic activity during sleep on WM improvement in healthy young adults. Participants were tested in an operation span task (OSpan) in the morning and evening, and during the inter-test period subjects either experienced a nap or wake. We measured high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV) as an index of cardiac, parasympathetic activity during both wake and sleep. Participants showed the expected boost in parasympathetic activity during nap, compared with wake, as well as greater WM improvement after a nap compared with an equivalent period awake. Furthermore, parasympathetic activity during sleep, but not wake, was significantly correlated with WM improvement. Together these results indicate that the natural boost in parasympathetic activity during sleep has substantial benefits to gains in prefrontal executive function in young adults. We present a conceptual model illustrating the interaction between sleep, autonomic activity, and prefrontal brain function, and highlight open research questions that will facilitate understanding of the factors that contribute to executive abilities in young adults, as well as in cognitive aging.

Alternatively, here we report fibronectin (FN3)-based PARs with improved properties such as increased protein yield, rapid protein production, increased protein stability and predicted low immunogenicity due to the human origin of fibronectins. We examined the cytotoxicity of EGFR-targeting PARs in vitro in which the affinities of the EGFR fibronectins, the EGFR/ CD3 valency of the CSANs and the antigen expression levels were varied. Based on these selective in vitro cytotoxicity results, we conducted an in vivo study of FN3-PARs using an orthotopic breast cancer model. The FN3-PARs demonstrated potent tumor growth suppression with no adverse effects. Furthermore, these results demonstrated that FN3-PARs modulated the tumor microenvironment by downregulating EGFR signaling resulting in decreased PD-L1 expression.

For all these datasets of embryonic differentiation, SGE effectively captures the signal of the impending cell fate transitions, which cannot be detected by gene expressions. Some ""dark"" genes that are non-differential but sensitive to SGE values were revealed. The successful identification of critical transition for all five datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in analyzing scRNA-seq data from a network perspective, and the potential of SGE to track the dynamics of cell differentiation.","NA"

However, the structural response of intracellular IF to mechanical load has yet to be elucidated in cellulo. Here, we use in situ nonlinear Raman imaging combined with multivariate data analysis to quantify the intracellular secondary structure of the IF cytoskeletal protein vimentin under different states of cellular tension.

Sorcin (gene name SRI) is a calcium (Ca2+) binding protein involved in maintaining ER Ca2+ homeostasis.

We have previously shown that overexpressing sorcin under the rat insulin promoter in transgenic mice was protective against high fat diet-induced pancreatic beta cell dysfunction, namely preserving intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during lipotoxic stress. Additionally, sorcin overexpression was apparently activating ATF6 signalling in MIN6 cells despite lowering ER stress.

Here, in order to investigate further the relationship between sorcin and ATF6, we describe changes in sorcin expression during ER and lipotoxic stress and changes in ATF6 signalling after sorcin overexpression or inactivation, both in excitable and non-excitable cells.

Sorcin mRNA levels were significantly increased in response to the ER stress-inducing agents thapsigargin and tunicamycin, but not by palmitate. On the contrary, palmitate caused a significant decrease in sorcin expression as assessed by both qRT-PCR and Western blotting despite inducing ER stress. Moreover, palmitate prevented the increase in sorcin expression induced by thapsigargin. In addition, sorcin overexpression significantly increased ATF6 transcriptional activity, whereas sorcin inactivation decreased ATF6 signalling. Finally, sorcin overexpression increased levels of ATF6 immunoreactivity and FRET imaging experiments following ER stress induction by thapsigargin showed a direct sorcin-ATF6 interaction.

Altogether, our data suggest that sorcin down-regulation during lipotoxicity may prevent full ATF6 activation and a normal UPR during the progression of obesity and insulin resistance, contributing to beta cell failure and type 2 diabetes.","NA"

Lysogens are dominant in the microbial-dense environment of the mammalian-gut. This observation contrasts with the long-standing hypothesis of lysogeny being favored in microbial communities with low densities. Here we hypothesized that phage coinfections--the most studied molecular mechanism of lysogeny in lambda phage--increases at high microbial abundances. To test this hypothesis, we developed a biophysical model of coinfection and stochastically sampled ranges of phage and bacterial concentrations, adsorption rates, lysogenic commitment times, and community diversity from marine and gut microbiomes. Based on lambda experiments, a Poisson process assessed the probability of lysogeny via coinfection in these ecosystems. In 90% of the sampled marine ecosystems, lysogeny stayed below 10% of the bacterial community. In contrast, 25% of the sampled gut communities stayed above 25% of lysogeny, representing an estimated nine trillion lysogens formed via phage coinfection in the human gut every day. The prevalence of lysogeny in the gut was a consequence of the higher densities and faster adsorption rates. In marine communities, which were characterized by lower densities and phage adsorption rates, lysogeny via coinfection was still possible for communities with long lysogenic commitments times. Our study suggests that physical mechanisms can favor coinfection and cause lysogeny at poor growth conditions (long commitment times) and in rich environments (high densities and adsorption rates).

ImportancePhage integration in bacterial genomes manipulate microbial dynamics from the oceans to the human gut. This phage-bacteria interaction, called lysogeny, is well-studied in laboratory models, but its environmental drivers remain unclear. Here we quantified the frequency of lysogeny via phage coinfection--the most studied mechanism of lysogeny--by developing a biophysical model that incorporated a meta-analysis of the properties of marine and gut microbiomes. Lysogeny was found to be more frequent in high-productive environments like the gut, due to higher phage and bacterial densities and faster phage adsorption rates. At low cell densities, lysogeny via coinfection was possible for hosts with long duplication times. Our research bridges the molecular understanding of lysogeny with the ecology of complex microbial communities.","NA"

We have investigated the translational programmes launched by the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe subject to five environmental stresses: oxidative stress, heavy metal, heat shock, osmotic shock and DNA damage. We also explored the contribution of two major defence pathways to these programmes: The Integrated Stress Response, which directly regulates translation initiation, and the stress-response MAPK pathway. To obtain a genome-wide and high-resolution view of this phenomenon, we performed ribosome profiling of control cells and of cells subject to each of the five stresses mentioned above, both in wild type background and in cells in which the Integrated Stress Response or the MAPK pathway were inactivated.

Translational changes were partially dependent on the integrity of both signalling pathways. Interestingly, we found that the transcription factor Fil1, a functional homologue of the Gcn4 and Atf4 proteins (from budding yeast and mammals, respectively), was highly upregulated in most stresses. Consistent with this result, Fil1 was required for the normal response to most stresses. A large group of mRNAs were translationally downregulated, including many required for ribosome biogenesis. Overall, our data suggest that severe stresses lead to the implementation of a universal translational response, which includes energy-saving measures (reduction of ribosome production) and induction of a Fil1-mediated transcriptional programme.

Surprisingly, ribosomes stalled on tryptophan codons specifically upon oxidative stress, a phenomenon that is likely caused by a decrease in charged tRNA-Tryptophan. Tryptophan stalling led to a mild translation elongation reduction and contributed to the inhibition of initiation by the Integrated Stress Response. Taken together, our results show that different stresses elicit common and specific translational responses, revealing a special and so far unknown role in Tryptophan-tRNA availability.","NA"

The lack of appropriate human model systems that enable organ- and/or diseasespecific interrogation of clock functions is a major obstacle hindering advancements of translational applications using chronotherapy. In this report, we show that both pluripotent stem cell-derived human intestinal organoids engrafted into mice and patient-derived human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) possess robust circadian rhythms, and demonstrate circadian phase-dependent necrotic cell death responses to Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB). Intriguingly, mouse and human enteroids demonstrate anti-phasic necrotic cell death responses. RNA-Seq data show ~4% of genes are rhythmically expressed in HIEs. Remarkably, we observe anti-phasic gene expression of Rac1, a small GTPase directly inactivated by TcdB, between mouse and human enteroids. Importantly, the observed circadian time-dependent necrotic cell death response is abolished in both mouse enteroids and human intestinal organoids (HIOs) lacking robust circadian rhythms. Our findings uncover robust functions of circadian rhythms regulating critical clock-controlled genes (CCGs) in human enteroids governing organism-specific, circadian phasedependent necrotic cell death responses.

Recent studies link reduced brain N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) levels to impaired cognition in various neurological diseases, including MS. NAAG levels are regulated by glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), which hydrolyzes the neuropeptide to N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and glutamate. Although several GCPII inhibitors, such as 2-(phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid (2-PMPA), elevate brain NAAG levels and restore cognitive function in preclinical studies when given at high systemic doses or via direct brain injection, no GCPII inhibitors are clinically available due to poor bioavailability and limited brain penetration. Systemic hydroxyl dendrimers (~4 nm) have been successfully used to enhance brain delivery of drugs selectively to activated glia. We recently discovered that GCPII is highly upregulated in activated microglia after brain injury. To determine if dendrimer conjugation could enhance the brain delivery of GCPII inhibitors, specifically in the context of MS, we attached 2-PMPA to hydroxyl polyamidoamicne (PAMAM) dendrimers (D-2PMPA) using a highly efficient click chemistry approach. Targeted uptake of D-2PMPA into activated glia was subsequently confirmed in glial cultures where it showed robust anti-inflammatory activity, including an elevation in TGF{beta} and a reduction in TNF. Given these positive effects, D-2PMPA (20mg/kg) or vehicle dendrimer were dosed twice weekly to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-immunized mice starting at disease onset (therapeutic paradigm). D-2PMPA significantly improved cognition in EAE as assessed by Barnes maze performance, even though physical severity was not impacted. Glial target engagement was confirmed, as CD11b+ enriched cells isolated from hippocampi in D-2PMPA-treated mice exhibited almost complete loss of GCPII activity. These data demonstrate the utility of hydroxyl dendrimers to enhance brain penetration and support the development of D-2PMPA to treat cognitive impairment in MS.

T2*-weighted MRI images can be processed to produce quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM) and R2* maps. These reflect iron and myelin concentrations, which are altered in many pathophysiological processes. The relaxation parameters of human brain tissue are such that R2* mapping and QSM show particularly strong gains in contrast-to-noise ratio at ultra-high field (7T) vs clinical field strengths (1.5 - 3T). We aimed to determine the inter-subject and inter-site reproducibility of QSM and R2* mapping at 7T, in readiness for future multi-site clinical studies.

MethodsTen healthy volunteers were scanned with harmonised single- and multi-echo T2*-weighted gradient echo pulse sequences. Participants were scanned five times at each ""home"" site and once at each of four other sites. The five sites had 1x Philips, 2x Siemens Magnetom, and 2x Siemens Terra scanners. QSM and R2* maps were computed with the Multi-Scale Dipole Inversion (MSDI) algorithm (https://github.com/fil-physics/Publication-Code). Results were assessed in relevant subcortical and cortical regions of interest (ROIs) defined manually or by the MNI152 standard space.

Results and DiscussionMean susceptibility ({chi}) and R2* values agreed broadly with literature values in all ROIs. The inter-site within-subject standard deviation was 0.001 - 0.005 ppm ({chi}) and 0.0005 - 0.001 ms-1 (R2*). For {chi} this is 21-95% better than 3T reports, and 15-124% better for R2*. The median ICC from within- and cross-site R2* data was 0.98 and 0.91, respectively. Multi-echo QSM had greater variability vs single-echo QSM especially in areas with large B0 inhomogeneity such as the inferior frontal cortex. Across sites, R2* values were more consistent than QSM in subcortical structures due to differences in B0-shimming. On a between-subject level, our measured {chi} and R2* cross-site variance is comparable to within-site variance in the literature, suggesting that it is reasonable to pool data across sites using our harmonised protocol.

ConclusionThe harmonized UK7T protocol and pipeline delivers over a 2-fold improvement in the coefficient of reproducibility for QSM and R2* at 7T compared to previous reports of multi-site reproducibility at 3T. These protocols are ready for use in multi-site clinical studies at 7T.","NA"

Although trans-acting gene expression quantitative trait loci (trans-eQTLs) can be a powerful approach to directly reveal cellular processes modulated by disease variants, detecting trans-eQTLs remains challenging due to their small effect sizes and large number of genes tested. However, if a single trans-eQTL controls a group of co-regulated genes, then multiple testing burden can be greatly reduced by summarising gene expression at the level of co-expression modules prior to trans-eQTL analysis.

ResultsWe analysed gene expression and genotype data from six blood cell types from 226 to 710 individuals. We inferred gene co-expression modules with five methods on the full dataset, as well as in each cell type separately. We detected a number of established co-expression module trans-eQTLs, such as the monocyte-specific associations at the IFNB1 and LYZ loci, as well as a platelet-specific ARHGEF3 locus associated with mean platelet volume. We also discovered a novel trans association near the SLC39A8 gene in LPS-stimulated monocytes. Here, we linked an early-response cis-eQTL of the SLC39A8 gene to a module of co-expressed metallothionein genes upregulated more than 20 hours later and used motif analysis to identify zinc-induced activation of the MTF1 transcription factor as a likely mediator of this effect.

ConclusionsOur analysis provides a rare detailed characterisation of a trans-eQTL effect cascade from a proximal cis effect to the affected signalling pathway, transcription factor, and target genes. This highlights how co-expression analysis combined with functional enrichment analysis can greatly improve the identification and prioritisation of trans-eQTLs when applied to emerging cell-type specific datasets.","NA"

DNA-PK and the cNHEJ pathway play important roles in the DNA repair phase of CSR. To initiate cNHEJ, KU binds to DNA ends, and recruits and activates DNA-PK.

An increase in gain is accompanied by a decrease in the temporal precision of transmission and a reduction in the efficiency with which vesicles transfer visual information.

Simulation results furthermore suggest that such phase separation may occur in heterogenous cellular environment, not just between tRNA and cellular proteins but also between ribosomes and proteins where there may be competition for positively charged proteins.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCELiquid-liquid phase separation has been recognized as a key mechanism for forming membrane-less organelles in cells. Commonly discussed mechanisms invoke a role of disordered peptides and specific multi-valent interactions. We report here phase separation of RNA and proteins based on a more universal principle of charge complementarity that does not require disorder or specific interactions. The findings are supported by coarse-grained simulations, theory, and experimental validation via microscopy and FRET spectroscopy. The implications of this work are that condensate formation may be an even more universal phenomenon in biological systems than thought to date.","NA"

The eggs of spotted mackerel Scomber australicus and chub mackerel S. japonicus in the western North Pacific has been identified based on egg diameter. Recent density of spotted mackerel was considerably high despite its low stock biomass. A possibility of this phenomenon is due to overestimation because the difference in egg diameter has become ambiguous between two species. However, we cannot test this possibility using DNA analysis because the eggs are fixed with formalin. Here, we estimated the index of egg density of spotted mackerel using a spatio-temporal model that incorporates the effect of egg density of chub mackerel on the catchability of spotted mackerel, using 15 years data of spawning eggs. We then examined how retrospective biases in estimated stock abundance were reduced when using the index from the model. The index estimated from the model decreased temporal fluctuation and showed smooth patterns. Especially, the recent index was considerably revised down rather than the nominal index. Additionally, the retrospective bias decreased ca. half compared with the nominal index. Therefore, incorporating species misidentification bias should be an essential process for improving stock assessment.","NA"

Specifically, TEVs containing microRNA miR-424 suppressed the CD28-CD80/86 costimulatory pathway in tumor infiltrating T cells and dendritic cells. Modified TEVs with miR-424 knocked down enhanced T-cell mediated antitumor immune response in CRC tumor models and increased the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapies (ICBT).

Moreover, injections of modified TEVs boosted the ICBT efficacy in CRC models that mimic treatment refractory late-stage disease. Collectively, we demonstrate a critical role for TEVs in antitumor immune regulation and immunotherapy response, which could be developed as a novel treatment for ICBT resistant human CRC.","NA"

We used cellular barcoding to directly monitor clonal dynamics during tumor recurrence in a genetically engineered mouse model. We found that the clonal diversity of tumors progressively decreased during tumor regression, residual disease, and recurrence. Only a fraction of subclones survived oncogene withdrawal and persisted in residual tumors. The minimal residual disease phase itself was accompanied by a continued attrition of clones, suggesting an ongoing process of selection during dormancy. The reactivation of dormant residual cells into recurrent tumors followed several distinct evolutionary routes. Approximately half of the recurrent tumors exhibited a striking clonal dominance in which one or two subclones comprised the vast majority of the tumor. The majority of these clonal recurrent tumors exhibited evidence of de novo acquisition of Met amplification, and were sensitive to small-molecule Met inhibitors. A second group of recurrent tumors exhibited marked polyclonality, with thousands of subclones and a clonal architecture very similar to primary tumors. These polyclonal recurrent tumors were not sensitive to Met inhibitors, but were instead dependent upon an autocrine IL-6 - Stat3 pathway. These results suggest that the survival and reactivation of dormant tumors can proceed via multiple independent routes, producing recurrent tumors with distinct clonal composition, genetic alterations, and drug sensitivities.","NA"

Under stress conditions, the transcriptionally active form of XBP1 is generated by unique splicing of Xbp1 mRNA by the ER-resident protein inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1). Genetic deletion of XBP1 has multiple consequences: some resulting from the loss of the transcription factor per se, and others related to compensatory upstream activation of IRE1. The objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of XBP1 deletion in adult mouse liver and determine to what extent they are direct or indirect. XBP1 was deleted specifically from hepatocytes in adult Xbp1fl/fl mice using AAV8-Transthyretin-Cre (Xbp1{Delta}hep). Xbp1{Delta}hep mice exhibited no liver disease at baseline, but developed acute biochemical and histologic liver injury in response to a dietary challenge with fructose for 4 wk. Fructose-mediated liver injury in Xbp1{Delta}hep mice coincided with heightened IRE1 activity, as demonstrated by cJun phosphorylation and regulated IRE1 -dependent RNA decay (RIDD). Activation of eIF2 was also evident, with associated up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic molecules CHOP, BIM and PUMA. To determine whether the adverse consequences of liver-specific XBP1 deletion were due to XBP1 loss or heightened IRE1 activity, we repeated a fructose challenge in mice with liver-specific deletion of both XBP1 and IRE1 (Xbp1{Delta}hep;IRE1{Delta}hep). Xbp1{Delta}hep;IRE1{Delta}hep mice were protected from fructose-mediated liver injury and failed to exhibit any of the signs of ER stress seen in mice lacking XBP1 alone. The protective effect of IRE1 deletion persisted even with long-term exposure to fructose. Xbp1{Delta}hep mice developed liver fibrosis at 16 wk, but Xbp1{Delta}hep;IRE1{Delta}hep mice did not. Overall, the results indicate that the deleterious effects of hepatocyte-specific XBP1 deletion are due primarily to hyperactivation of IRE1. They support further exploration of IRE1 as a contributor to acute and chronic liver diseases.","NA"

A number of studies from multiple fields have documented the life-history associated cost. However, very few laboratory selection studies on increased resistance to cold stress have assessed the life-history associated cost.

For this study, we used replicate populations of D. melanogaster that have been selected for increased resistance to non lethal cold-shock and their control populations. We have previously reported that the selected populations have evolved faster reproductive recovery and higher egg-viability post cold shock. In this study we investigated the potential life-history costs of these evolved traits. To assess life-history cost, we measured longevity and life time fecundity with and without cold-shock. Development time and dry body weight were measured from the progeny of parents that were given cold-shock or no-shock treatments.

We found that there were no significant differences in longevity, life time fecundity, and male body weight between the selected and control populations. However, females from the selected populations were bigger in size compared to the control populations. These findings suggest that there is no life-history cost associated with the evolution of greater resistance to cold-shock.","NA"

Here, we demonstrate that three NanR dimers bind a (GGTATA)3-repeat operator cooperatively and with high affinity. Truncation of an N-terminal extension abolishes cooperative binding. The effector, N-acetylneuraminate, binds NanR and attenuates DNA binding. Crystal structure data show that N-acetylneuraminate binding to NanR causes a domain rearrangement that locks the protein in a conformation that prevents DNA binding. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of NanR bound to DNA reveal the DNA binding domain is reorganized to engage DNA, while the three dimers assemble in close proximity across the (GGTATA)3-repeat operator allowing protein-protein interactions to form via the N-terminal extensions.

Patch leaving is a canonical foraging behavior, but classic theoretical conceptions of patch leaving decisions lack some key naturalistic details. Optimal foraging theory provides general rules for when an animal should leave a patch, but does not provide mechanistic insights about how those rules change with the structure of the environment. Such a mechanistic framework would aid in designing quantitative experiments to unravel behavioral and neural underpinnings of foraging. To address these shortcomings, we develop a normative theory of patch foraging decisions. Using a Bayesian approach, we treat patch leaving behavior as a statistical inference problem. We derive the animals optimal decision strategies in both non-depleting and depleting environments. A majority of these cases can be analyzed explicitly using methods from stochastic processes. Our behavioral predictions are expressed in terms of the optimal patch residence time and the decision rule by which an animal departs a patch. We also extend our theory to a hierarchical model in which the forager learns the environmental food resource distribution. The quantitative framework we develop will therefore help experimenters move from analyzing trial based behavior to continuous behavior without the loss of quantitative rigor. Our theoretical framework both extends optimal foraging theory and motivates a variety of behavioral and neuroscientific experiments investigating patch foraging behavior.","NA"

However, the key miRNAs and the associated signaling pathways that regulate the growth and metastasis of CRC remain unclear.

MethodsThe circulating miRNAs from BALB/c mice with CRC CT26 cell implantation were assayed by microarray. Then, mmu-miR-762 mimic and inhibitor were transfected to CT26 cells for analysis of cell viability, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell cycle, and regulatory molecule expression. Human subjects were included for comparison the circulating has-miR-762 levels in CRC patients and control donors, as well as the patients with and without distant metastasis.

ResultsThe miRNA levels in mice with CRC cell implantation indicated that plasma mmu-miR-762 was upregulated. Transfection of mmu-miR-762 mimic to CT26 cells increased cell viability, invasion, and EMT, whereas transfection of mmu-miR-762 inhibitor decreased the above abilities. Cells treated with high-concentration mmu-miR-762 inhibitor induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Western blot analysis showed that mmu-miR-762 mimic transfection upregulated the expression of Wnt-1 and {beta}-catenin. Further analysis was performed to demonstrate the correlation of has-miR-762 with CRC patients. The results showed that serum has-miR-762 levels in CRC patients were higher than in control donors. Among the CRC patients, patients with distant metastasis showed higher serum has-miR-762 levels than patients without distant metastasis.

Seeming phenotype conservation may however hide evolutionary changes in the underlying developmental mechanisms by which a trait is produced. This cryptic evolution is also called Developmental System Drift, and the extent of this phenomenon unclear. We used a well-characterized evo-devo model system, rodent molars, to test the correlation between phenotypic and developmental evolution. Between mouse and hamster, the morphology of the lower molars has much less diverged than the morphology of the upper molars. Is development accordingly more conserved? We compared molar crown formation with a standard approach, and with a tight transcriptome time-series to get a quantitative molecular profiling of developmental states. Our data identify common trends in the development of all molars. Upper and lower molars have their specificities since the early steps of morphogenesis, at the levels of the pattern of cusp formation, cellular composition and biased gene expression. The extent of difference in lower vs. upper molar development within one species does correlate with the extent of difference in final morphology. However, the specificity of lower vs. upper molar development is drowned among the rapid evolution of development, which is highly species-specific in term of expression levels and temporal profiles. Divergence in developmental systems is almost as high for lower as it is for upper molar, despite much lesser morphological changes in lower molar crown. Hence, our results point an extensive drift in this developmental system. Because serial organs are largely sharing gene networks, it supports previous theoretical work that suggest a causal link between pleiotropy and DSD.","NA"

However, the precise mechanism for this improvement is not known. Studies have shown greater WM gains after a period of sleep than a similar period of wake (Kuriyama et al. 2008a; Zinke, Noack, and Born 2018), with WM improvement correlated with slow wave activity (SWA; 0.5-1Hz) during slow wave sleep (SWS) (Sattari et al. 2019; Pugin et al. 2015; Ferrarelli et al. 2019). A different body of literature has suggested an important role for autonomic activity during wake for WM (Hansen et al. 2004; Mosley, Laborde, and Kavanagh 2018). A recent study from our group reported that the temporal coupling of autonomic and central events (ACEs) during sleep was associated with memory consolidation (Naji et al. 2019). We found that heart rate bursts (HR bursts) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are accompanied by increases in SWA and sigma (12-15Hz) power, as well as increases in the high-frequency (HF) component of the RR interval, reflecting vagal rebound. In addition, ACEs predict long-term, episodic memory improvement. Building on these previous results, we examined whether ACEs may also contribute to gains in WM. We tested 104 young adults in an operation span task (OSPAN) in the morning and evening, with either a nap (with electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG)) or wake between testing sessions. We identified HR bursts in the ECG and replicated the increases in SWA and sigma prior to peak of the HR burst, as well as vagal rebound after the peak. Furthermore, we showed sleep-dependent WM improvement, which was predicted by ACE activity. Using regression analyses, we discovered that significantly more variance in WM improvement could be explained with ACE variables than with overall sleep activity not time-locked with ECG. These results provide the first evidence that coordinated autonomic and central events play a significant role in sleep-related WM improvement and implicate the potential of autonomic interventions during sleep for cognitive enhancement.","NA"

The envelope glycoproteins of HCV are heavily glycosylated with a high proportion of high-mannose glycans (HMGs), which serve as a shield against neutralizing antibodies and assist in the interaction with cell-entry receptors. However, currently there is no approved therapeutic targeting this potentially druggable biomarker. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the lectibody Avaren-Fc (AvFc), a HMG-binding lectin-Fc fusion protein. In vitro assays showed AvFcs capacity to neutralize cell culture-derived HCV in a genotype independent manner with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. A histidine buffer-based AvFc formulation was developed for in vivo studies using the PXB human liver chimeric mouse model. Systemic administration of AvFc was well tolerated; after 11 consecutive doses every other day at 25 mg/kg, there were no significant changes in body or liver weights, nor any impact noted in blood human albumin levels or serum alanine aminotransferase activity. Gross necropsy and liver pathology further confirmed the lack of discernible toxicity. This treatment regimen successfully prevented genotype 1a HCV infection in all animals, while an AvFc mutant lacking HMG binding activity failed to block the infection. These results suggest that targeting envelope HMGs is a promising therapeutic approach against HCV infection. In particular, AvFc may provide a safe and efficacious means to prevent recurrent infection upon liver transplantation in HCV-related end-stage liver disease patients.","NA"

Unlike the biosynthetic pathway, the transporters involved in metabolite secretion remain unknown. The developmental regulation of isoflavone and soyasaponin secretions has been recently reported, but the diurnal regulation of their biosynthesis and secretion still needs to be further studied. To address these challenges, we conducted transcriptome and metabolite analysis using hydroponically grown soybean plants at 6-hour intervals for 48 hours in a 12-h-light/12-h-dark condition. Isoflavone and soyasaponin biosynthetic genes showed opposite patterns in the root tissues; that is, the former genes are highly expressed in daytime, while the latter ones are strongly induced at nighttime. GmMYB176 encoding a transcription factor of isoflavone biosynthesis was upregulated from ZT0 (6:00 am) to ZT6 (12:00 am), followed by the induction of isoflavone biosynthetic genes at ZT6. The isoflavone aglycone content in the roots accordingly increased from ZT6 to ZT18 (0:00 am), accompanied by an increase in glucoside levels that peaked at ZT0. The isoflavone aglycone content in root exudates was kept consistent throughout the day, whereas that of glucosides increased at ZT6, which reflected the decreased expression of the gene encoding beta-glucosidase involved in the hydrolysis of apoplast-localized isoflavone conjugates. Co-expression analysis revealed that those isoflavone and soyasaponin biosynthetic genes formed separate clusters, which exhibited a correlation to ABC and MATE transporter genes. As summary, the results in this study indicated the diurnal regulation of isoflavone biosynthesis in soybean roots and the putative transporter genes responsible for isoflavone and soyasaponin transport.","NA"

Additionally, we determined that the N-terminus including the HMG domain of xSox11 is necessary for interaction with Pou3f2 and Ngn2, and established a novel role for the N-terminal 46 amino acids in the establishment of placodal progenitors.

Residence times in actively-moving and inactive states were distributed in a power law-based scale-free manner. Multifractal analysis showed that temporal correlation and temporal clusterization were distinct between the actively-moving state and the inactive state.

To date, three different SSU1 associated CR events have been described, including translocations XV-t-XVI and VIII-t-XVI and inversion inv-XVI. In the present study, we developed a multiplex PCR method (SSU1 check-up) that allows a rapid characterization of these three chromosomal configurations in a single experiment. Nearly 600 S. cerevisiae strains collected from fermented grape juice were genotyped by microsatellite markers. We demonstrated that alleles of the SSU1 promoter are differently distributed according to the wine environment (cellar versus vineyard) and the nature of the grape juice. Moreover, rearranged SSU1 promoters are significantly enriched among commercial starters. In addition, nearly isogenic strains collected in similar environments show different CR suggesting that translocation events occur with a non-negligible frequency in clonal populations likely due to mitotic recombination events. Finally, the link between the nature of SSU1 promoter and the tolerance to sulfite was statistically validated in natural grape juice containing various SO2 concentrations. The SSU1 check-up is therefore a convenient new tool for addressing population genetics questions and for selecting yeast strains by using molecular markers.","NA"

Unfortunately, efforts to design and engineer microbial cell factories are challenging because design-built-test cycles, iterations of re-engineering organisms to test and optimize new sets of enzymes, are slow. To alleviate this challenge, we demonstrate a cell-free approach termed in vitro Prototyping and Rapid Optimization of Biosynthetic Enzymes (or iPROBE). In iPROBE, a large number of pathway combinations can be rapidly built and optimized. The key idea is to use cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) to manufacture pathway enzymes in separate reactions that are then mixed to modularly assemble multiple, distinct biosynthetic pathways. As a model, we apply our approach to the 9-step heterologous enzyme pathway to limonene in extracts from Escherichia coli. In iterative cycles of design, we studied the impact of 54 enzyme homologs, multiple enzyme levels, and cofactor concentrations on pathway performance. In total, we screened over 150 unique sets of enzymes in 580 unique pathway conditions to increase limonene production in 24 hours from 0.2 to 4.5 mM (23 to 610 mg/L). Finally, to demonstrate the modularity of this pathway, we also synthesized the biofuel precursors pinene and bisabolene. We anticipate that iPROBE will accelerate design-build-test cycles for metabolic engineering, enabling data-driven multiplexed cell-free methods for testing large combinations of biosynthetic enzymes to inform cellular design.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility to copper of L. pneumophila isolates recovered from various sites: two clinical and seven environmental from hot water systems biofilm & water, and from cooling tower water. After one-week acclimation in simulated drinking water, strains were exposed to various copper concentrations (0.8 to 5 mg/L) for over 672 hours. Complete loss of culturability was observed for three isolates, following copper exposure to 5 mg/L for 672h. Two ST1427-like isolates were highly sensitive to copper, while the other two, isolated from biofilm samples, were resistant. The expression of the copper resistance gene copA evaluated by RT-qPCR was significantly higher for the biofilm isolates. All four ST1427-like isolates were recovered from the same water system during an outbreak. Whole genome sequencing results confirmed that the four isolates are very close phylogenetically, differing by only 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms, suggesting in situ adaptation to microenvironmental conditions, possibly due to epigenetic regulation. These results indicate that the immediate environment within a building water distribution system influences the tolerance of L. pneumophila to copper. Increased contact of L. pneumophila biofilm strains with copper piping or copper alloys in the heat exchanger might lead to local adaptation. The phenotypic differences observed between water and biofilm isolates from the hot water system of a healthcare facility warrants further investigation to assess the relevance of evaluating disinfection performances based on water sampling alone.

ImportanceLegionella pneumophila is a pathogen indigenous to natural and large building water systems in the bulk and the biofilm phases. The immediate environment within a system can impact the tolerance of L. pneumophila to environmental stressors, including copper. In healthcare facilities, copper levels in water can vary, depending on water quality, plumbing materials and age. This study evaluated the impact of the isolation site (water vs biofilm, hot water system vs cooling tower) within building water systems. Closely related strains isolated from a healthcare facility hot water system exhibited variable tolerance to copper stress shown by differential expression of copA, with biofilm isolates displaying highest expression and tolerance. Relying on the detection of L. pneumophila in water samples following exposure to environmental stressor such as copper may underestimate the prevalence of L. pneumophila, leading to inappropriate risk management strategies and increasing the risk of exposure for vulnerable patients.","NA"

Their transcriptome reflects an individuals physiological and pathological state, consequently bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing have been used to assess health and disease. As RNA is dynamic and could be affected by ex vivo conditions before RNA stabilization, we have assessed the influence of temporary storage on the transcriptome.

MethodsWe collected peripheral blood from six healthy donors and processed it immediately or stored it either at 4{square} or room temperature (RT, 18-22{square}) for 2h, 6h and 24h. Total cellular RNA was extracted from leukocytes after red blood cells lysis and the transcriptome analyzed using RNA sequencing.

ResultsWe identified 152 up-regulated and 12 down-regulated coding genes in samples stored at 4{square} for 24h with most of the up-regulated genes related to nucleosome assembly. More coding genes changed expression at RT, with 1218 increased and 1480 decreased. The increased genes were particularly related to mRNA processing and apoptosis, while the decreased genes were associated with neutrophil activation and cytokine production, implying a reduced proportion of neutrophils, which was confirmed by leukocyte subsets analysis. Most house-keeping genes changed expression during storage, but genes such as TUBB and C1orf43 were relatively stable and could serve as reference genes.

ConclusionTemporary storage conditions profoundly affect leukocyte gene expression profiles and change leukocyte subset proportions. Blood samples stored at 4{square} for 6h largely maintain their original transcriptome.","NA"

The combination of biophysical characterization, high-resolution proton-less NMR spectroscopy and molecular simulations revealed, at an atomistic level, how the same general mechanism was adapted to specific habitats and lifestyles. In particular, we demonstrate how environment-sensing characteristics arise from specifically positioned intra- or intermolecular electrostatic interactions. Our integrative approach clarified the mechanism for H-NS-mediated environmental sensing and suggests that it resulted from the exaptation of an ancestral protein feature.","NA"

First, results show that we could reproduce experimental object displacement with high accuracy via the simulated embodiment in the virtual world by feeding a spinal cord model with experimental registration of the cortical activity. Second, by using computational models of multiple granularities, our preliminary results show the possibility of simulating several features of the brain after stroke, from the local alteration in neuronal activity to long-range connectivity remodeling.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, root hairs are distributed in the epidermis in a specific pattern, regularly alternating with non-root hair cells in continuous cell files. This patterning is regulated by internal factors such as a number of hormones, as well as external factors like nutrient availability. Thus, root-hair patterning is an excellent model for studying the plasticity of cell fate determination in response to environmental changes. Here, we report that loss-of-function mutants in the Protein O-Fucosyltransferase SPINDLY (SPY) form ectopic root hairs. Using a number of transcriptional reporters, we show that patterning in spy-22 is affected upstream of the central regulators GLABRA2 (GL2) and WEREWOLF (WER). O-fucosylation of nuclear and cytosolic proteins is an important post-translational modification that is still not very well understood. So far, SPY is best characterized for its role in gibberellin signalling via fucosylation of the growth-repressing DELLA protein REPRESSOR OF GA (RGA).

Previous studies have reported that Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 function is regulated by SUMOylation that is catalyzed by the Smc5-Smc6-Mms21 complex. These studies used strains in which SGS1 was C-terminally tagged with three or six copies of a human influenza hemagglutinin-derived epitope tag (3HA and 6HA). They identified SGS1 mutants that affect its SUMOylation, which we will refer to as SGS1 SUMO-site mutants. In previous work, these mutants showed phenotypes consistent with substantial loss of Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 function during the mitotic cell cycle. We find that the reported phenotypes are largely due to the presence of the HA epitope tags. Untagged SGS1 SUMO-site mutants show either wild-type or weak hypomorphic phenotypes, depending on the assay. These phenotypes are exacerbated by both 6HA and 3HA epitope tags in two different S. cerevisiae strain backgrounds. Importantly, a C-terminal 6HA tag confers strong hypomorphic or null phenotypes on an otherwise wild-type Sgs1 protein. Taken together, these results suggest that the HA epitope tags used in previous studies seriously compromise Sgs1 function. Furthermore, they raise the possibilities either that sufficient SUMOylation of the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex might still occur in the SUMO-site mutants isolated, or that Smc5-Smc6-Mms21-mediated SUMOylation plays a minor role in the regulation of Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 during recombination.","NA"

Moreover, a prerequisite for mutp53 stabilization is loss of the remaining wildtype (WT) p53 allele (loss-of-heterozygosity, p53LOH) in mutp53/+ tumors. Thus, GOF, mutp53 stabilization and p53LOH are strictly linked. However, the driving force for p53LOH is unknown. Typically, heterozygous tumors are an instable transition state. Here we identify the repressive WTp53-HSF1 axis as the driver of p53LOH.

We find that the WTp53 allele in AOM/DSS-induced colorectal tumors (CRC) of p53R248Q/+ mice retains its haploid transcriptional activity. Notably, WTp53 represses heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1) activity, the master transcription factor of the proteotoxic stress defense response (HSR) that is ubiquitously and constitutively activated in cancer tissues. HSR is critical for stabilizing oncogenic proteins including mutp53. WTp53-retaining murine CRC tumors and tumor-derived organoids and human CRC cells all suppress the tumor-promoting HSF1 transcriptional program.

Mechanistically, the retained WTp53 allele activates CDKN1A/p21, leading to cell cycle inhibition and suppression of the E2F target gene MLK3. MLK3 links cell cycle to the MAPK stress pathway to activate the HSR response. We show that in p53R248Q/+ tumors WTp53 activation by constitutive stress (emanating from proliferative/metabolic stresses and genomic instability) represses MLK3, consequently inactivating the MAPK-HSF1 response necessary to ensure tumor survival. This creates strong selection pressure for p53LOH which eliminates the repressive WTp53-HSF1 axis and unleashes the tumor-promoting HSF1 functions, inducing mutp53 stabilization and enabling invasion.

However, the mechanism by which YAP/TAZ signaling becomes hyperactive and drives prostate cancer progression is currently unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that CCM1 induces the metastasis of multiple types of prostate cancer cells by regulating YAP/TAZ signaling. Mechanistically, CCM1, a gene mutated in cerebral cavernous malformation, suppresses DDX5, which regulates the PLK1-mediated suppression of YAP/TAZ signaling, indicating that CCM1 and DDX5 are novel upstream regulators of YAP/TAZ signaling. We also revealed that higher expression of CCM1, which is uniquely found in advanced prostate cancer, is inversely correlated with metastasis-free and overall survival in patients with prostate cancer. Our findings highlight the importance of CCM1-DDX5-PLK1-YAP/TAZ signaling in the metastasis of prostate cancer cells.

We built gene expression prediction models using the PrediXcan method in 681 breast and 295 ovarian tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 211 breast and 99 ovarian normal tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project and integrated these with GWAS meta-analysis data from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (122,977 cases/105,974 controls) and the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (22,406 cases/40,941 controls). The integration was achieved through novel application of a pleiotropy-guided conditional/conjunction false discovery rate approach for the first time in the setting of a TWAS. This identified 14 new candidate breast cancer susceptibility genes spanning 11 genomic regions and 8 new candidate ovarian cancer susceptibility genes spanning 5 genomic regions at conjunction FDR < 0.05 that were > 1 Mb away from known breast and/or ovarian cancer susceptibility loci.

Samples were either immediately processed or stored at room temperature for 24 or 72 hours before plasma preparation. DNA fragment size was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was performed on the cell-free DNA isolated from these plasma samples.

These viruses bud from the plasma membrane of infected cells after the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) is transported from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane via Rab11a-marked recycling endosomes. The viral proteins that are critical for mediating this important initial step in viral assembly are unknown. Here we use the model paramyxovirus, murine parainfluenza virus 1, or Sendai virus (SeV), to investigate the roles of viral proteins in Rab11a-driven virion assembly. We previously reported that infection with SeV containing high levels of copy-back defective viral genomes (DVGs) generates heterogenous populations of cells. Cells enriched in full-length virus produce viral particles containing standard or defective viral genomes, while cells enriched in DVGs do not, despite high levels of defective viral genome replication. Here we take advantage of this heterogenous cell phenotype to identify proteins that mediate interaction of vRNPs with Rab11a. We examine the role of matrix protein and nucleoprotein and determine that they are not sufficient to drive interaction of vRNPs with recycling endosomes. Using a combination of mass spectrometry and comparative protein abundance and localization in DVG- and FL-high cells, we identify viral polymerase complex components L and, specifically, its cofactor C proteins as interactors with Rab11a. We find that accumulation of these proteins within the cell is the defining feature that differentiates cells that proceed to viral egress from cells which remain in replication phases.

IMPORTANCEParamyxoviruses are a family of viruses that include a number of pathogens with significant burdens on human health. Particularly, human parainfluenza viruses are an important cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in children for which there are no vaccines or direct acting antivirals. These cytoplasmic replicating viruses bud from the plasma membrane and coopt cellular endosomal recycling pathways to traffic viral ribonucleoprotein complexes from the cytoplasm to the membrane of infected cells. The viral proteins required for viral engagement with the recycling endosome pathway are still not known. Here we use the model paramyxovirus Sendai virus, or murine parainfluenza virus 1, to investigate the role of viral proteins in this initial step of viral assembly. We find that viral polymerase components large protein L and accessory C proteins are necessary for engagement with recycling endosomes. These findings are important in identifying viral proteins as potential targets for development of antivirals.","NA"

MethodsTwo complementary multivariate analyses - genomic structural equation modelling (SEM) and colocalization analysis - were exploited to identify the shared SNPs for ASD and ADHD, using summary data from two independent GWAS of ASD (N=46,350) and ADHD individuals (N=55,374).

ResultsGenomic SEM identified 7 novel SNPs shared between ASD and ADHD (pgenome-wide<5e-8), including three SNPs that were not identified in any of the original univariate GWAS of ASD and ADHD (rs227378, rs2391769 and rs325506). We also mapped 4 novel genes (MANBA, DPYD, INSM1, and PAX1) to SNPs shared by ASD and ADHD, as well as 4 genes that had already been mapped to SNPs identified in either ASD or ADHD GWAS (SORCS3, XRN2, PTBP2 and NKX2-4). All the shared genes between ADHD and ASD were more prominently expressed in the brain than the genes mapped to SNPs specific to ASD or ADHD. Colocalization analyses revealed that 44% percent of the SNPs associated with ASD (p<1e-6) colocalized with ADHD SNPs and 26% of the SNPs associated with ADHD (p<1e-6) colocalized with ASD SNPs.

Our study showed that in vivo, premature senescence occurred, with decrease of SIRT1, during CCl4-induced defenestration in HSECs and liver fibrogenesis; whereas overexpressing SIRT1 with adenovirus vector lessened progerin-associated premature senescence to relieve CCl4-induced defenestration and liver fibrosis. In vitro, fenestrae in HSECs disappeared, with progerin-associated premature senescence; these effects aggravated by H2O2-induced oxidative damage. Nevertheless, knockdown of NOX2 or overexpression of SIRT1 with adenovirus vector reduced progerin-associated premature senescence to maintain fenestrae through deacetylating p53. Furthermore, more Ac p53 K381 and progerin co-localized with accumulation of actin filament (F-actin) in the nuclear envelope of H2O2-treated HSECs; in contrast, these effects were rescued by overexpressing SIRT1.

This remedy also had bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in a chronic mouse wound. However, the safety profile of Balds eyesalve has not yet been demonstrated, and this is vital before testing in humans. Here, we determined the safety potential of Balds eyesalve using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models representative of skin or eye infections. We also confirmed that Balds eyesalve is active against an important eye pathogen, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Low levels of cytotoxicity were observed in eyesalve-treated cell lines representative of skin and immune cells. Results from a bovine corneal opacity and permeability test demonstrated slight irritation to the cornea that resolved within 10 minutes. The slug mucosal irritation assay revealed that a low level of mucus was secreted by slugs exposed to eyesalve, indicating mild mucosal irritation. We obtained promising results from mouse wound closure experiments; no visible signs of irritation or inflammation were observed. Our results suggest that Balds eyesalve could be tested further on human volunteers to assess safety for topical application against bacterial infections.

ImportanceAlternative treatment for bacterial infections are needed to combat the ever increasing repertoire of bacteria resistant to antibiotics. A medieval plant-based remedy, Balds eyesalve, shows promise as a substitute for the treatment of these infections. For any substance to be effective in the treatment of bacterial infections in humans, it is important to consider the safety profile. This is a key consideration in order to have the necessary regulatory approval. We demonstrate the safety profile of Balds eyesalve using a variety of models, including whole-organ and whole-animal models. Our results show that Balds eyesalve is mildly toxic to cultured human cells, but potentially suitable for patch tests on healthy human volunteers to assess safety for later clinical trials. Our work has the potential to transform the management of diseases caused by bacterial infections, such as diabetic foot ulcers, through topical application of a natural product cocktail based on Balds eyesalve.","NA"

In insects, the Mushroom Body Output Neurons (MBONs) and the Lateral Horn Neurons (LHNs) are thought to provide the learnt and innate drives, respectively. However their patterns of convergence and the mechanisms by which their outputs are used to select actions are not well understood. We used electron microscopy reconstruction to comprehensively map the downstream targets of all MBONs in Drosophila larva and characterise their patterns of convergence with LHNs. We discovered convergence neurons that receive direct input from MBONs and LHNs and compare opposite behaviour drives. Functional imaging and optogenetic manipulation suggest these convergence neurons compute the overall predicted value of approaching or avoiding an odor and mediate action selection.

By individually mutating residues to tryptophan within the putative trajectory of gating charges, we observed that the charge pathway during activation is a rotation and a tilted translation that differs between R1 and R2 and is distinct from their deactivation pathway. Tryptophan-induced quenching of qBBr also indicates that a crucial residue of the hydrophobic plug is linked to the Cole-Moore shift through its interaction with R1.

In the vertebrate retina, endothelial cells are guided by astrocytes migrating along the inner surface, and the two processes are coupled by a tightly regulated cross-talk between the two cell types. Here, we investigated how the FAT1 Cadherin, a regulator of tissue morphogenesis governing tissue cross-talks, influences retinal vascular development. Through late-onset inactivation in the neural lineage in mice, we bypassed an early contribution of Fat1 to eye development, and assessed its requirement for postnatal retina angiogenesis. We found that neural Fat1 expression, by controlling the polarity of astrocyte progenitor migration, regulates astrocyte maturation. By interfering with astrocyte migration and maturation, neural Fat1 deletion deregulates the astrocyte/endothelial cell coupling, and delays retinal angiogenesis. Mice with neural-Fat1 ablation exhibit persistent abnormalities of the retinal vascular architecture, such as an increased vascular density in deep layers. Altogether, this study identifies Fat1 as a regulator of neurovascular communication, essential for retinal vascular development and integrity.","NA"

SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and employs the cellular serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming. TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host. Understanding how TMPRSS2 protein expression in the lung varies in the population could reveal important insights into differential susceptibility to influenza and coronavirus infections. Here, we systematically analyzed coding-region variants in TMPRSS2 and the eQTL variants, which may affect the gene expression, to compare the genomic characteristics of TMPRSS2 among different populations. Our findings suggest that the lung-specific eQTL variants may confer different susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from different populations under the similar conditions. In particular, we found that the eQTL variant rs35074065 is associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 but with a low expression of the interferon (IFN)-/{beta}-inducible gene, MX1, splicing isoform.

Knowing their interactions with biomacromolecular targets demands a deep understanding of binding mechanisms. Dozens of papers have suggested that discovering of the binding event by means of conventional unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulation urges considerable amount of computational resources, therefore, only one who holds a cluster or a supercomputer can afford such extensive simulations. Thus, many researchers who do not own such resources are reluctant to take the benefits of running unbiased molecular dynamics simulation, in full atomistic details, when studying a ligand binding pathway. Many researchers are impelled to be content with biased molecular dynamics simulations which seek its validation due to its intrinsic preconceived framework. In this work, we have presented a workable stratagem to encourage everyone to perform unbiased (unguided) molecular dynamics simulations, in this case a protein-ligand binding process, by typical desktop computers and so achieve valuable results in nanosecond time scale. Here, we have described a dynamical bindings process of an anticancer drug, the dasatinib, to the c-Src kinase in full atomistic details for the first time, without applying any biasing force or potential which may lead the drug to artificial interactions with the protein.

Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed.

The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene).

We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95% limit of detection (LOD95%). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n=16) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n=6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity.

PCR efficiency was [&ge;]96% for all assays and the estimated LOD95% varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene.

We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.","NA"

The current SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic has caused more than 2,000,000 infections globally and nearly 200,000 deaths. Coronaviruses enter susceptible cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after endocytosis of the virus into endosomes. Previous results with SARS and MERS CoV have shown that the Spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity and immunogenicity. Herein, we show that expression of SARS CoV-2 S (S-n) glycoprotein after transient transfection of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells caused extensive cell fusion in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S (S-o) glycoprotein. S-n expression was detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces and caused the formation of very large multinucleated cells (syncytia) by 48 hours post transfection. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytial formation in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients. This differential S-n versus S-o-mediated cell fusion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is able to spread from cell-to-cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular spaces and neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs for ability to inhibit S-n and S-o cell fusion revealed that the FDA approved HIV-protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S-n and S-o-mediated cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of cell fusion was observed at a 10 micromolar concentration. Computational modeling and in silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S-n and S-o-mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir mesylate acts on cellular processes to inhibit S proteolytic processing. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate as an antiviral drug, especially at early times after SARS-CoV-2 symptoms appear.","NA"

The similarity of integrated gene expression signatures between irradiated eIF4G1-silenced breast cancer cells and known drugs was measured by enrichment scores. Drugs with positive enrichment scores were selected as potential radiosensitizers. The radiosensitizing effects of the candidate radiosensitizers were analyzed in breast cancer cells (MCF-7, MX-1, and MDA-MB-231) by CCK-8 assays and colony-forming capability after exposure to ionizing radiation. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Expressions of eIF4G1 and a series of DNA damage response proteins were analyzed by Western blot assays. Bosutinib was proposed to be a promising radiosensitizer as its administration markedly reduced the dosages of both the drug and ionizing radiation and was associated with fewer adverse drug reactions. The combined treatment with ionizing radiation and bosutinib significantly increased the cells killing potency in all three cell lines as compared to ionizing radiation or bosutinib alone. MX-1 cells were revealed to be the most sensitive to both ionizing radiation and bosutinib among the three cell lines. Bosutinib noticeably downregulated the expression of eIF4G1 in a dose-dependent manner and also reduced the expression of DNA damage response proteins (including ATM, XRCC4, ATRIP, and GADD45a). Moreover, eIF4G1 could be a key target of bosutinib through which it regulates DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation.

In the present study isolated male and female CKO-cardiomyocytes exhibit increased prostaglandin (PG)-generating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. The PG-degrading hydroxyprostaglandin-dehydrogenase-15 (HPGD) expression is only reduced in male cardiomyocytes, which is associated with increased PGD2 secretion from isolated male but not female CKO-cardiomyocytes. Reduced HPGD expression in male cardiomyocytes derive from impaired androgen-receptor-(AR)-signaling due to loss of its co-factor STAT3. Elevated PGD2 secretion in males is associated with increased white adipocyte accumulation in aged male but not female hearts. Adipocyte differentiation is enhanced in isolated SCA-1+-cardiac-progenitor-cells (CPC) from young male CKO-mice compared to the adipocyte differentiation of male wildtype (WT)-CPC and CPC isolated from female mice. Epigenetic analysis in freshly isolated male CKO-CPC display hypermethylation in pro-angiogenic genes (Fgfr2, Epas1) and hypomethylation in the white adipocyte differentiation gene Zfp423 associated with upregulated ZFP423 expression and a shift from endothelial to white adipocyte differentiation compared to WT-CPC. The expression of the histone-methyltransferase EZH2 is reduced in male CKO-CPC compared to male WT-CPC whereas no differences in the EZH2 expression in female CPC were observed. Clonally expanded CPC can differentiate into endothelial cells or into adipocytes depending on the differentiation conditions. ZFP423 overexpression is sufficient to induce white adipocyte differentiation of clonal CPC. In isolated WT-CPC, PGD2 stimulation reduces the expression of EZH2 thereby upregulating ZFP423 expression and promoting white adipocyte differentiation.

Thus, cardiomyocyte STAT3-deficiency leads to age-related and sex-specific cardiac remodeling and failure in part due to sex-specific alterations in PGD2 secretion and subsequent epigenetic impairment of the differentiation potential of CPC. Causally involved is the impaired AR signaling in absence of STAT3, which reduces the expression of the PG degrading enzyme HPGD.","NA"

To help detoxify these defensive chemicals, several insect herbivores are known to harbor gut microbiota with the metabolic capacity to degrade PSCs. Leaf-cutter ants are generalist herbivores, obtaining sustenance from specialized fungus gardens that act as external digestive systems, degrading the diverse collection of plants foraged by the ants. There is in vitro evidence that certain PSCs harm Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, the fungal cultivar of leaf-cutter ants, suggesting a role for the Proteobacteria-dominant bacterial community present within fungus gardens. Here, we investigate the ability of symbiotic bacteria present within fungus gardens of leaf-cutter ants to degrade PSCs. We cultured fungus garden bacteria, sequenced the genomes of 42 isolates, and identified genes involved in PSC degradation, including genes encoding cytochrome p450s and genes in geraniol, cumate, cinnamate, and -pinene/limonene degradation pathways. Using metatranscriptomic analysis, we show that some of these degradation genes are expressed in situ. Most of the bacterial isolates grew unhindered in the presence of PSCs and, using GC-MS, we determined that isolates from the genera Bacillus, Burkholderia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas degrade -pinene, {beta}-caryophyllene, or linalool. Using a headspace sampler, we show that sub-colonies of fungus gardens reduced -pinene and linalool over a 36-hour period, while L. gongylophorus strains alone only reduced linalool. Overall, our results reveal that the bacterial community in fungus gardens play a pivotal role in alleviating the effect of PSCs on the leaf-cutter ant system.

ImportanceLeaf-cutter ants are dominant neotropical herbivores capable of deriving energy from a wide range of plant substrates. The success of leaf-cutter ants is largely due to their external gut composed of key microbial symbionts, specifically, the fungal mutualist L. gongylophorus and a consistent bacterial community. Both symbionts are known to have critical roles in extracting energy from plant material, yet comparatively little is known about their role in the detoxification of plant secondary compounds. Here, we assess if the bacterial community associated with leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens can degrade harmful plant chemicals. We identify plant secondary compound detoxification in leaf-cutter ant gardens as a process that depends on the degradative potential of both the bacterial community and L. gongylophorus. Our findings suggest the fungus garden and its associated microbial community influences the generalist foraging abilities of the ants, underscoring the importance of microbial symbionts in plant substrate suitability for herbivores.","NA"

Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn), a fungal pathogen that causes fatal infection, subverts the host autophagy initiation complex (AIC) and its upstream regulatory proteins, to promote its phagocytosis and intracellular parasitism of host cells. The mechanisms by which the pathogen engages host AIC proteins remain obscure. Here, we show that the recruitment of host AIC proteins to forming phagosomes is dependent upon the activity of CD44, a host cell surface receptor that engages fungal hyaluronic acid (HA). This interaction elevates intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and activates CaMKK{beta} and its downstream target AMPK, which results in activation of ULK1 and the recruitment of AIC components. Moreover, we demonstrate that HA-coated beads efficiently recruit AIC components to phagosomes. Taken together, these findings show that fungal HA plays a critical role in directing the internalization and productive intracellular membrane trafficking of a fungal pathogen of global importance.

Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets cells of the lung epithelium causing respiratory infection and pathologies, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected. However, the importance of the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 for virus-induced pathologies, spreading and prognosis remains unknown. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle in human intestinal epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication and production of infectious de-novo virus particles. Importantly, we identified intestinal epithelial cells as the best culture model to propagate SARS-CoV-2. We found that viral infection elicited an extremely robust intrinsic immune response where, interestingly, type III interferon mediated response was significantly more efficient at controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread compared to type I interferon. Taken together, our data demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells are a productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggest that the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 may participate in the pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients by contributing in increasing patient viremia and by fueling an exacerbated cytokine response.","NA"

Discovered a few years ago, they are proposed as key players in the evolution of several groups of DNA viruses and virus-host interaction machinery. Pipolins are the most recent addition to the group, are integrated in the genomes of bacteria from diverse phyla and also present as circular plasmids in mitochondria. Remarkably, pipolins-encoded PolBs are proficient DNA polymerases endowed with DNA priming capacity, hence the name, primer-independent PolB (piPolB).

We have now surveyed the presence of pipolins in a collection of 2238 human and animal pathogenic Escherichia coli strains and found that, although detected in only 25 new isolates (1.1%), they are present in E. coli strains from a wide variety of pathotypes, serotypes, phylogenetic groups and sequence types. Overall, the pangenome of strains carrying pipolins is highly diverse, despite the fact that a considerable number of strains belongs to only three clonal complexes (CC10, CC23 and CC32). Comparative analysis with a set of 67 additional pipolin-harboring strains from GenBank further confirmed these results. The genetic structure of pipolins shows great flexibility and variability, with the piPolB gene and the attachment sites being the only common features. Most pipolins contain one or more recombinases that would be involved in excision/integration of the element in the same conserved tRNA gene. This mobilization mechanism might explain the apparent incompatibility of pipolins with other integrative MGEs such as integrons.

In addition, analysis of cophylogeny between pipolins and pipolin-harboring strains showed a lack of congruence between several pipolins and their host strains, in agreement with horizontal transfer between hosts. Overall, these results indicate that pipolins can serve as a vehicle for genetic transfer among circulating E. coli and possibly also among other pathogenic bacteria.","NA"

MethodsThe case-control studies on the association between AGT/EL gene polymorphism and CAD were collected through searching PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, CNKI and Wanfang database up to March 1, 2020. Stata 15.0 software was used for analysis.

ResultsA total of 29 articles met the inclusion criteria. After analyzing, it was found that the M235T polymorphism of AGT gene was associated with the occurrence of CAD. In the allele model (T vs. M), OR=1.38 (P < 0.05). In other heredity, there was also statistically significant. Subgroup analysis indicated that except the heterozygous genetic model of the Chinese population, other genetic models of the Caucasian and Chinese population were also statistically significant. The 584C/T polymorphism of EL gene was associated with the occurrence of CAD, with OR=0.83 (P < 0.05) in the allele model (T vs. C) and OR=0.80 (P < 0.05) in the dominant gene model. Also, in the allele model of Caucasian subgroup, OR=0.83 (P < 0.05), while in Asian subgroup, there was no statistically significant genetic model.

ConclusionAGT M235 and EL 584C/T polymorphisms are associated with CAD susceptibility. The genotype TT, TC or allele T of AGT M235T and genotype CC or allele C of EL 584C/T might be the genetic risk factors for the development of CAD.","NA"

The issue emerges from previous studies reporting inhibitory and attentional demands both elicit rIFG activation. Here, we address this issue based on the proposition that inhibitory and attentional control are predicated on different network mechanisms. We derived and causally tested network mechanisms using EEG, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) and focused ultrasound stimulation in humans performing a Stop-Signal task. rIFG stimulation increased inhibitory performance and speed. DCM of evoked responses linked behavioral inhibition to rIFG top-down gain modulation of pre-SMA inhibitory populations. These results reconcile competing accounts of prefrontal cognitive control function, by identifying rIFG-based inhibitory mechanisms as distinct from other top-down cognitive control processes.","NA"

This allows to distinguish facies-dependent vegetational changes from those that were climate induced. Cluster analyses and NMDS of well-preserved palynomorph assemblages reveal four successional stages in the vegetation during peat accumulation: (1) a near-coastal vegetation, (2) a lowland mire, (3) a transitional mire, and (4) a terminal mire. Biodiversity measures show that plant diversity decreased significantly in the successive stages. The highly diverse vegetation at the coast and in the adjacent lowland mire was replaced by low diversity communities adapted to wet acidic environments and nutrient deficiency. The palynomorph assemblages are dominated by elements such as Alnus or Sphagnum. Typical tropical elements which are characteristic for the Middle Eocene part of the succession are missing.

The ""Wattle and Daub"" model of cyst wall formation of Entamoeba invadens had already been reported. In this study, we demonstrate in more detail the morphological stages of chitin wall formation in E. invadens using fluorescent chitin-binding dyes and immunolocalization of the cyst wall proteins. Here, the expression and localization of chitin synthase and the importance of actin cytoskeleton dynamics at cellular level, during encystations have been demonstrated for the first time. Chitin deposition was found to be initiated on the cell surface mostly from one distinct point, though multipoint initiation was also observed sometimes. From these points, the wall grew outwards and gradually covered the entire cyst surface with time. The initiation of chitin deposition was guided by the localization of chitin synthase 1 on the plasma membrane. The gradual formation of the cyst wall follows the Wattle and daub model. The chitin deposition occurred on the foundation of Jacob lectin at the cell membrane, and the other cyst wall components, like chitinase, and Jessie were also found to be present in the growing incomplete walls. In contrary to the Wattle and daub model, Jessie was found to be expressed and localized in the growing wall at the early hours of encystations. During encystation, F-actin was reorganized into the cortical region within an hour encystation initiation and remained intact until the completion of the chitin wall. Disruption of cortical actin polymerization with 2, 3-Butanedione monoxime inhibited proper wall formation but produced wall-less cysts or cysts with defective chitin wall. Malformations of cyst-walls were mainly due to improper localization and activity of chitin synthases, which indicates the indispensability of cortical actin cytoskeleton for the proper cyst wall formation.

Author SummaryEntamoeba parasites reach new hosts using the resistant cyst form, so preventing its formation can stop the spread of amoebiasis. The resistant nature of the cyst is due to the chitin wall, and thus identifying the critical steps of wall formation could provide targets for designing new drugs. Here we studied the morphological stages of the cyst wall formation by observing how the chitin and other cell wall components were deposited on the cell surface using fluorescent chitin-binding dyes and antibodies against cyst wall proteins. In most cases, the chitin wall was found to start from one distinct point from which it spread all over the cell surface, guided by chitin synthase. The composition of these incomplete walls was the same as a mature cyst wall indicating that the wall may be a result of extracellular self-assembly of its constituents from one starting point. We have also observed that F-actin polymerized in the cortex of encysting cells and its disruption resulted in wall-less cysts or cysts with aberrant walls showing the importance of actin cytoskeleton in proper chitin deposition.","NA"

We have solved structures of ribosomes purified from in vivo tissues by cryo-EM, revealing differences in precise ribosomal arrangement for testis and ovary 80S ribosomes. Differences in the amino acid composition of paralog pairs and their localisation on the ribosome exterior indicate paralog-switching could alter the ribosome surface, enabling different proteins to regulate translation.

While ubiquitous in the bacterial world, they have seldom been described among endosymbiotic bacteria. One notable exception in the APSE phage that is found associated with the gammaproteobacterial Hamiltonella defensa, hosted by several insect species. This secondary facultative endosymbiont is not necessary for the survival of its hosts but can infect certain individuals or even whole populations. Its infection in aphids is often associated with protection against parasitoid wasps. This protective phenotype has actually been linked to the infection of the symbiont strain with an APSE, which carries a toxin cassette that varies among so-called ""types"". In the present work, we seek to expand our understanding of the diversity of APSE phages as well as the relations of their Hamiltonella hosts. For this, we assembled and annotated the full genomes of 16 APSE phages infecting Hamiltonella symbionts across 10 insect species. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses suggest that recombination has occurred repeatedly among lineages. Comparative genomics of the phage genomes revealed two variable regions that are useful for phage typing. Additionally, we find that mobile elements could play a role in the acquisition of new genes in the toxin cassette. Altogether, we provide an unprecedented view of APSE diversity and their genome evolution across aphids.

We explored the influence of minor allele frequency and data completion filters on h2: GRMs derived from fewer SNPs had reduced h2 estimates and the relatedness coefficients significantly deviated from those generated with more SNPs. As a corollary, we discussed limitations to the application of GRMs in the wild, notably how skewed GRMs increase variance around h2 estimates. This is the first study to estimate h2 on a free-ranging population of white-tailed deer and should be informative for breeding designs and management.","NA"

The resulting linear assembly lacks diversity because it does not contain allelic variation. Lack of diversity is a drawback of linear references that causes reference allele bias. High nucleotide diversity and the separation of individuals by hundreds of breeds make cattle ideally suited to investigate the optimal composition of variation-aware references.

ResultsWe augment the bovine linear reference sequence (ARS-UCD1.2) with variants filtered for allele frequency in dairy (Brown Swiss, Holstein) and dual-purpose (Fleckvieh, Original Braunvieh) cattle breeds to construct either breed-specific or pan-genome reference graphs using the vg toolkit. We find that read mapping is more accurate to variation-aware than linear references if pre-selected variants are used to construct the genome graphs. Graphs that contain random variants do not improve read mapping over the linear reference sequence. Breed-specific augmented and pan-genome graphs enable almost similar mapping accuracy improvements over the linear reference. We construct a whole-genome graph that contains the Hereford-based reference sequence and 14 million alleles that have alternate allele frequency greater than 0.03 in the Brown Swiss cattle breed. We show that our novel variation-aware reference facilitates accurate read mapping and unbiased sequence variant genotyping for SNPs and Indels.

ConclusionsWe developed the first variation-aware reference graph for an agricultural animal: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3759712. Our novel reference structure improves sequence read mapping and variant genotyping over the linear reference. Our work is a first step towards the transition from linear to variation-aware reference structures in species with high genetic diversity and many sub-populations.","NA"

A range of diverse subtractive proteomics approaches - namely, identification of human non-homologous and pathogen-specific essential proteins, druggability and  anti-target analysis, prediction of subcellular localization, human microbiome non-homology screening, analysis of virulence factors, protein-protein interactions studies. Among 16 novel cytoplasmic proteins,  VIBPA Type II secretion system protein L and  VIBPA Putative fimbrial protein Z were allowed to molecular docking with 350 human metabolites, which revealed that Eliglustat, Simvastatin and Hydroxocobalamin were the top drug molecules considering free binding energy. On the contrary,  Sensor histidine protein kinase UhpB and  Flagellar hook-associated protein of 25 novel membrane proteins were subjected to T and B cell epitope prediction, antigenicity testing, transmembrane topology screening, allergenicity and toxicity assessment, population coverage analysis and molecular docking were adopted to generate the most immunogenic epitopes. Three subunit vaccines were constructed by the combination of highly antigenic epitopes along with suitable adjuvant, PADRE sequence and linkers. The designed vaccine constructs (V1, V2, V3) were analyzed by their physiochemical properties and molecular docking with MHC molecules that suggested the superiority of construct V1. Besides, the binding affinity of human TLR1/2 heterodimer and construct V1 was also biologically significant. The vaccine-receptor complex exhibited deformability at a minimum level that also strengthened our prediction.

Its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, has evolved rapidly since its first emergence in December 2019. Mutations in the viral genome have critical impacts on the adaptation of viral strains to the local environment, and may alter the characteristics of viral transmission, disease manifestation, and the efficacy of treatment and vaccination. Using the complete sequences of 1,932 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we examined the genomic, geographic and temporal distributions of aged, new, and frequent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, and identified six phylogenetic clusters of the strains, which also exhibit a geographic preference in different continents. Mutations in the form of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) provide a direct interpretation for the six phylogenetic clusters. Linkage disequilibrium, haplotype structure, evolutionary process, global distribution of mutations unveiled a sketch of the mutational history. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the average mutation count and case fatality, and this correlation had strengthened with time, suggesting an important role of SNVs on disease outcomes. This study suggests that SNVs may become an important consideration in virus detection, clinical treatment, drug design, and vaccine development to avoid target shifting, and that continued isolation and sequencing is a crucial component in the fight against this pandemic.

Significance StatementMutation is the driving force of evolution for viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19. In this study, we discovered that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is changing rapidly from the originally isolated form. These mutations have been spreading around the world and caused more than 2.5 million of infected cases and 170 thousands of deaths. We found that fourteen frequent mutations identified in this study can characterize the six main clusters of SARS-CoV-2 strains. In addition, we found the mutation burden is positively correlated with the fatality of COVID-19 patients. Understanding mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome will provide useful insight for the design of treatment and vaccination.","NA"

The paleotemperature proxy TEX86 is built on the observation that archaea alter the number of five- and six-membered rings in the hydrophobic core of their glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) membrane lipids when growing at different temperatures. However, recent work with these archaea also highlights a role for other factors, such as pH or energy availability in determining the degree of core lipid cyclization. To better understand the role of these variables we cultivated a model Crenarchaeon, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, over a range in temperature, pH, oxygen flux, or agitation speed, and quantified the changes in growth rate, biomass yield, and core lipid compositions. The average degree of cyclization in core lipids correlated with growth rate under most conditions. When considered alongside other experimental findings from both the thermoacidophilic and mesoneutrophilic archaea, the results suggest the cyclization of archaeal lipids records a universal response to energy availability at the cellular level. Although we isolated the effects of individual parameters, there remains a need for multi-factor experiments (e.g., pH + temperature + redox) to establish a robust framework to interpret biomarker records of environmental change.","NA"

RSC1 and RSC2 are orthologs of mammalian PBRM1 (polybromo) which define two separate RSC sub-complexes.

Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor drugs like imatinib are the mainstay of treatment and cases resistant to these drugs have a poor prognosis in the absence of a compatible stem-cell donor. However, with rapid advancements in gene-editing technologies, most studies are now focusing on developing a translational model targeting single-gene disorders with a prospective permanent cure. The present study explores the potential application of the RNA targeting CRISPR-Cas13a system for effective knockdown of BCR-ABL fusion transcript in a CML cell line, K562. The CRISPR system was successfully able to lower the expression of downstream genes (pCRKL and pCRK) dependent on the activated BCR-ABL kinase signal by up-to 4.3 folds. The viability of the CRISPR treated cells were also significantly lowered by 373.83-fold (p-value= 0.000891196). The time-dependent kinetics also highlighted the significant in-vitro suppressive activity to last up to 8 weeks (p-value: 0.025). As per the cDNA sequencing data from Oxford MinION next-generation sequencer, the CRISPR treated cells show 62.37% suspected cleaved reads.

Hippocampal injury - which compromises neurofunctional outcome - occurs as apoptosis of progenitor cells and immature neurons of the hippocampal dentate granule cell layer thereby impairing the regenerative capacity of the hippocampal stem cell niche. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) harbours the potential to modulate the proliferative activity of this neuronal stem cell niche. In this study, specific rTMS protocols - namely continuous and intermittent theta burst stimulation (cTBS and iTBS) - were applied on infant rats microbiologically cured from PM by five days of antibiotic treatment. Following two days of exposure to TBS, differential gene expression was analysed by whole transcriptome analysis using RNAseq. cTBS provoked a prominent effect in inducing differential gene expression in the cortex and the hippocampus, whereas iTBS only affect gene expression in the cortex. TBS induced polarisation of microglia and astrocytes towards an inflammatory phenotype, while reducing neurogenesis, neuroplasticity and regeneration. cTBS was further found to induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. We conclude that cTBS intensified neuroinflammation after PM, which translated into increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators thereby inhibiting neuroregeneration.","NA"

At any given moment in time, only a fraction of this information is available to the eyes and the brain, rendering naturalistic vision a collection of incomplete snapshots. Previous research suggests that in order to successfully contextualize this fragmented information, the visual system sorts inputs according to spatial schemata, that is knowledge about the typical composition of the visual world. Here, we used a large set of 840 different natural scene fragments to investigate whether this sorting mechanism can operate across the diverse visual environments encountered during real-world vision. We recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants viewed incomplete scene fragments at fixation. Using representational similarity analysis on the EEG data, we tracked the fragments cortical representations across time. We found that the fragments typical vertical location within the environment (top or bottom) predicted their cortical representations, indexing a sorting of information according to spatial schemata. The fragments cortical representations were most strongly organized by their vertical location at around 200ms after image onset, suggesting rapid perceptual sorting of information according to spatial schemata. In control analyses, we show that this sorting is flexible with respect to visual features: it is neither explained by commonalities between visually similar indoor and outdoor scenes, nor by the feature organization emerging from a deep neural network trained on scene categorization. Demonstrating such a flexible sorting across a wide range of visually diverse scenes suggests a contextualization mechanism suitable for complex and variable real-world environments.","NA"

However, they also display high error rates that can reach 10 to 30%, for basic ONT and non-CCS PacBio reads. As a result, error correction is often the first step of projects dealing with long reads. As first long reads sequencing experiments produced reads displaying error rates higher than 15% on average, most methods relied on the complementary use of short reads data to perform correction, in a hybrid approach. However, these sequencing technologies evolve fast, and the error rate of the long reads now reaches 10 to 12%. As a result, self-correction is now frequently used as the first step of third-generation sequencing data analysis projects. As of today, efficient tools allowing to perform self-correction of the long reads are available, and recent observations suggest that avoiding the use of second-generation sequencing reads could bypass their inherent bias.

ResultsWe introduce CONSENT, a new method for the self-correction of long reads that combines different strategies from the state-of-the-art. More precisely, we combine a multiple sequence alignment strategy with the use of local de Bruijn graphs. Moreover, the multiple sequence alignment benefits from an efficient segmentation strategy based on k-mer chaining, which allows a considerable speed improvement. Our experiments show that CONSENT compares well to the latest state-of-the-art self-correction methods, and even outperforms them on real Oxford Nanopore datasets. In particular, they show that CONSENT is the only method able to efficiently scale to the correction of Oxford Nanopore ultra-long reads, and is able to process a full human dataset, containing reads reaching lengths up to 1.5 Mbp, in 15 days. Additionally, CONSENT also implements an assembly polishing feature, and is thus able to correct errors directly from raw long read assemblies. Our experiments show that CONSENT outperforms state-of-the-art polishing tools in terms of resource consumption, and provides comparable results. Moreover, we also show that, for a full human dataset, assembling the raw data and polishing the assembly afterwards is less time consuming than assembling the corrected reads, while providing better quality results.

For this study, we used replicate populations of D. melanogaster that have been selected for increased resistance to non lethal cold-shock and their control populations. We have previously reported that the selected populations have evolved faster reproductive recovery and higher egg-viability post cold shock. In this study we investigated the potential life-history costs of these evolved traits. To assess life-history cost, we measured longevity and life time fecundity with and without cold-shock. Development time and dry body weight were measured from the progeny of parents that were given cold-shock or no-shock treatments.

We found that there were no significant differences in longevity, life time fecundity, and male body weight between the selected and control populations. However, females from the selected populations were bigger in size compared to the control populations.

We find that the terminology used to describe the various manifestations of asexual apicomplexan cell division emphasizes either the number of offspring or site of budding, which are not directly comparable features and has led to confusion in the literature. Division modes have been primarily studied in two human pathogenic Apicomplexa, malaria-causing Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii, a major cause of opportunistic infections. Plasmodium spp. divide asexually by schizogony, producing multiple daughters per division round through a cortical budding process, though at several life-cycle nuclear amplifications are not followed by karyokinesis. T. gondii divides by endodyogeny producing two internally budding daughters per division round. Here we add to this diversity in replication mechanisms by considering the cattle parasite Babesia bigemina and the pig parasite Cystoisospora suis. B. bigemina produces two daughters per division round by a  binary fission mechanism whereas C. suis produces daughters through both endodyogeny and multiple internal budding known as endopolygeny. In addition, we provide new data from the causative agent of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM), Sarcocystis neurona, which also undergoes endopolygeny but differs from C. suis by maintaining a single multiploid nucleus. Overall, we operationally define two principally different division modes: internal budding found in cyst-forming Coccidia (comprising endodyogeny and two forms of endopolygeny) and external budding found in the other parasites studied (comprising the two forms of schizogony, binary fission and multiple fission). Progressive insights into the principles defining the molecular and cellular requirements for internal versus external budding, as well as variations encountered in sexual stages are discussed. The evolutionary pressures and mechanisms underlying apicomplexan cell division diversification carries relevance across Eukaryota.

Contribution to the FieldMechanisms of cell division vary dramatically across the Tree of Life, but the mechanistic basis has only been mapped for several model organisms. Here we present cell division strategies across Apicomplexa, a group of obligate intracellular parasites with significant impact on humans and domesticated animals. Asexual apicomplexan cell division is organized around assembly of daughter buds, but division forms differ in the cellular site of budding, number of offspring per division round, whether each S-phase follows karyokinesis and if mitotic rounds progress synchronously. This varies not just between parasites, but also between different life-cycle stages of a given species. We discuss the historical context of terminology describing division modes, which has led to confusion on how different modes relate to each other. Innovations in cell culture and genetics together with light microscopy advances have opened up cell biological studies that can shed light on this puzzle. We present new data for three division modes barely studied before. Together with existing data, we show how division modes are organized along phylogenetic lines and differentiate along external and internal budding mechanisms. We also discuss new insights into how the variations in division mode are regulated at the molecular level, and possess unique cell biological requirements.","NA"

The released parasites re-infect neighboring red blood cells and undergo another asexual cycle of differentiation and proliferation for 48 hours, before again bursting synchronously. The synchrony of bursting is lost during in vitro culturing of the parasite outside the human body, presumably because the asexual cycle is no longer entrained by host-specific circadian cues. Therefore, most in vitro malaria studies have relied on the artificial synchronization of the parasite population. However, much remains unknown about the degree of timing heterogeneity of asexual cycles and how artificial synchronization may affect this timing. Here, we combined time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and long-term culturing to follow single cells and directly measure the heterogeneous timing of in vitro asexual cycles. We first demonstrate that unsynchronized laboratory cultures are not fully asynchronous and the parasites exhibit a bimodal distribution in their first burst times. We then show that synchronized and unsynchronized cultures had similar asexual cycle periods, which indicates that artificial synchronization does not fundamentally perturb asexual cycle dynamics. Last, we demonstrate that sibling parasites descended from the same schizont exhibited significant variation in asexual cycle period, although smaller than the variation between non-siblings. The additional variance between non-siblings likely arises from the variable environments and/or developmental programs experienced in different host cells.","NA"

In the swarming state, bacterial films display several characteristics of active matter including intense and persistent long-ranged flocks and strong fluctuating velocity fields with significant vorticity. Additionally, swarm fronts are typically dynamically evolving interfaces. Many of these fronts separate motile active domains from passive frictional regions comprised of dead or non-motile bacteria. Here, we study the dynamics and structural features of a model active-passive interface in swarming Serratia marcescens. We expose localized regions of the swarm to high intensity wide-spectrum light thereby creating large domains of tightly packed immotile bacteria. When the light source is turned off, swarming bacteria outside this passivated region advance into this highly frictional domain and continuously reshape the interphase boundary. Combining results from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and intensity based image analysis, we find that the evolving interface has both a width and a characterizable roughness. Correlations between spatially separated surface fluctuations and damping of the same are influenced by the interaction of the interphase region with adjacently located and emergent collective flows. Dynamical growth exponents characterizing the spatiotemporal features of the surface are extracted and are found to differ from classically expected values for passive growth or erosion. To isolate the effects of hydrodynamic interactions generated by collective flows and that arising from steric interactions, we propose and analyze agent-based simulations with full hydrodynamics of rod-shaped, self-propelled particles. Our computations capture qualitative features of the swarm and predict correlation lengths consistent with experiments. Combining experiments with simulations, we conclude that hydrodynamic and steric interactions enable different modes of surface dynamics, morphology and thus front invasion.","NA"

However, little is known about how each cycle impacts downstream analyses, due to a lack of study and known limitations in common RNA quality metrics, e.g., RIN, at quantifying RNA degradation following repeated freeze-thaws. Here we quantify the impact of repeated freeze-thaw on the reliability of downstream RNA-Seq analysis. To do so, we developed a method to estimate the relative noise between technical replicates independently of RIN. Using this approach we inferred the effect of both RIN and the number of freeze-thaw cycles on sample noise. We find that RIN is unable to fully account for the change in sample noise due to freeze-thaw cycles. Additionally, freeze-thaw is detrimental to sample quality and differential expression (DE) reproducibility, approaching zero after three cycles for poly(A)-enriched samples, wherein the inherent 3 bias in read coverage is more exacerbated by freeze-thaw cycles, while ribosome-depleted samples are less affected by freeze-thaws. The use of poly(A)-enrichment for RNA sequencing is pervasive in library preparation of frozen tissue, and thus, it is important during experimental design and data analysis to consider the impact of repeated freeze-thaw cycles on reproducibility.

Peck","Brigham Young University","2020-04-24",4,"cc_no","new results","ecology","Since the inception of the discipline, understanding causal complexity in ecological communities has been a challenge. Here we draw insights from recent work on constraint closure that suggests ways of grappling with ecological complexity that yield generalizable theoretical insights. Using a set of evolutionary constraints on species flow through ecological communities, which include: selection, species drift, dispersal, and speciation, combined with multispecies interactions such as mutualistic interactions, and abiotic constraints, we demonstrate how constraint closure allows communities to emerge as semi-autonomous structures. Here we develop an agent-based model to explore how evolutionary constraints provide stability to ecological communities. The model is written in Netlogo, an agent based-modeling system, with advanced tools for manipulating spatially structured models and tools for tracking pattern formation. We articulate ways that ecological pattern formation, viewed through the lens of constraint closure, informs questions about stability and turnover in community ecology. The role of the chosen constraints was clear from the simulation results. It took the shape of both inducing stability and creating conditions for a more dynamic community with increases in species turnover through time. Key ecological and evolutionary variables showed overall stability in the landscape structure when plotted against the number of constraints, suggesting that these evolutionary forces act as constraints to the flow of species in such a way that constraint closure is achieved effecting semi-autonomy.

Author SummaryEcosystems are among the most complex structures studied. They comprise elements that seem both stable and contingent. The stability of these systems depends on interactions among their evolutionary history, including the accidents of organisms moving through the landscape and microhabitats of the earth, and the biotic and abiotic conditions in which they occur. When ecosystems are stable, how is that achieved? Here we look at ecosystem stability through a computer simulation model that suggests that it may depend on what constrains the system and how those constraints are structured. Specifically, if the constraints found in an ecological community form a closed loop, that allows particular kinds of feedback may give structure to the ecosystem processes for a period of time. In this simulation model, we look at how evolutionary forces act in such a way these closed constraint loops may form. This may explain some kinds of ecosystem stability. This work will also be valuable to ecological theorists in understanding general ideas of stability in such systems.","NA"

Previous studies have reported that Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 function is regulated by SUMOylation that is catalyzed by the Smc5-Smc6-Mms21 complex. These studies used strains in which SGS1 was C-terminally tagged with three or six copies of a human influenza hemagglutinin-derived epitope tag (3HA and 6HA). They identified SGS1 mutants that affect its SUMOylation, which we will refer to as SGS1 SUMO-site mutants. In previous work, these mutants showed phenotypes consistent with substantial loss of Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 function during the mitotic cell cycle. We find that the reported phenotypes are largely due to the presence of the HA epitope tags. Untagged SGS1 SUMO-site mutants show either wild-type or weak hypomorphic phenotypes, depending on the assay. These phenotypes are exacerbated by both 6HA and 3HA epitope tags in two different S. cerevisiae strain backgrounds. Importantly, a C-terminal 6HA tag confers strong hypomorphic or null phenotypes on an otherwise wild-type Sgs1 protein. Taken together, these results suggest that the HA epitope tags used in previous studies seriously compromise Sgs1 function. Furthermore, they raise the possibilities either that sufficient SUMOylation of the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex might still occur in the SUMO-site mutants isolated, or that Smc5-Smc6-Mms21-mediated SUMOylation plays a minor role in the regulation of Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 during recombination.","NA"

In spite of restoring hearing sensitivity, difficulties with understanding speech in noisy environments often remain. One main reason is that sensorineural hearing loss not only causes loss of audibility but also other deficits, including peripheral distortion but also central temporal processing deficits. To investigate the neural consequences of hearing impairment in the brain underlying speech-in-noise difficulties, we compared EEG responses to natural speech of 14 hearing impaired adults with those of 14 age-matched normal-hearing adults. We measured neural envelope tracking to sentences and a story masked by different levels of a stationary noise or competing talker. Despite their sensorineural hearing loss, hearing impaired adults showed higher neural envelope tracking of the target than the competing talker, similar to their normal-hearing peers. Furthermore, hearing impairment was related to an additional increase in neural envelope tracking of the target talker, suggesting that hearing impaired adults may have an enhanced sensitivity to envelope modulations or require a larger differential tracking of target versus competing talker to neurally segregate speech from noise. Lastly, both normal-hearing and hearing impaired participants showed an increase in neural envelope tracking with increasing speech understanding. Hence, our results open avenues towards new clinical applications, such as neuro-steered prostheses as well as objective and automatic measurements of speech understanding performance.

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently COVID19 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been seen. We provide evidences based on analyses of existing public datasets and by using various in-silico approaches to explain some of these as factors that may explain population level differences. One of the key factors might be entry of virus in host cells due to differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that higher expression of ACE2 facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and with different frequencies in different populations, results in ACE2 homo-dimerization which is disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2 and becomes more difficult in presence of broad neutral amino acid transporter, B0AT1 (coded by SLC6A19), that usually does not express in Lungs. We also propose that the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest some other potential key host genes like ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as Cathepsins, that might have a critical role.

SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe pneumonia, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases. As reported, SARS-CoV-2 is 80% genetically identical to the 2003 SARS-CoV virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main receptor for entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. ACE2 is normally expressed in cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial cells, where it positively modulates the RAS system that regulates blood flow, pressure, and fluid homeostasis. Thus, virus-induced reduction of ACE2 gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe acute respiratory failure. Chromatin remodeling plays a significant role in the regulation of ACE2 gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome.

MethodsHere, we integrated data on physical chromatin interactions within the genome organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data to identify spatial expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and thus regulatory elements located within the ACE2 gene.

ResultsWe identified regulatory elements within ACE2 that control the expression of PIR, CA5B, and VPS13C in the lung. The gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses, de novo pyrimidine and polyamine synthesis, and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.

ConclusionOur study, although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory interactions is putative until proven by targeted experiments, supports the hypothesis that viral silencing of ACE2 alters the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra-cellular environment suitable for viral replication.","NA"

We established rapid and reversible optogenetic control for Set2, the sole H3K36 methyltransferase in yeast, by fusing the enzyme with the light activated nuclear shuttle (LANS) domain. Early H3K36me3 dynamics identified rapid methylation in vivo, with total H3K36me3 levels correlating with RNA abundance. Although genes exhibited disparate levels of H3K36 methylation, relative rates of H3K36me3 accumulation were largely linear and consistent across genes, suggesting a rate-limiting mechanism for H3K36me3 deposition. Removal H3K36me2/3 was also rapid and highly dependent on the demethylase Rph1. However, the per-gene rate of H3K36me3 loss weakly correlated with RNA abundance and followed exponential decay, suggesting H3K36 demethylases act in a global, stochastic manner.","NA"

Clinically, these patients are described with different terms, such as semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), semantic dementia (SD), or right temporal variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) depending on whether the predominant symptoms affect language, semantic knowledge for object or people, or socio-emotional behaviors. ATL atrophy presents with various degrees of lateralization, with right-sided cases considered rarer even though estimation of their prevalence is hampered by the paucity of studies on well-characterized, pathology-proven cohorts. Moreover, it is not clear whether left and right variants show a similar distribution of atrophy within the ATL cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

Here we study the largest cohort to-date of pathology-proven TDP-43-C cases diagnosed during life as svPPA, SD or right temporal variant FTD. We analyzed clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging data from 30 cases, a subset of which was followed longitudinally. Guided by recent structural and functional parcellation studies, we constructed four bilateral ATL regions of interest (ROIs). The computation of an atrophy lateralization index allowed the comparison of atrophy patterns between the two hemispheres. This led to an automatic, imaging-based classification of the cases as left-predominant or right-predominant. We then compared the two groups in terms of regional atrophy patterns within the ATL ROIs (cross-sectionally) and atrophy progression (longitudinally).

Results showed that 40% of pathology proven cases of TDP-43-C diagnosed with a temporal variant presented with right-lateralized atrophy. Moreover, the findings of our ATL ROI analysis indicated that, irrespective of atrophy lateralization, atrophy distribution within both ATLs follows a medial-to-lateral gradient. Finally, in both left and right cases, atrophy appeared to progress to the contralateral ATL, and from the anterior temporal pole to posterior temporal and orbitofrontal regions.

Taken together, our findings indicate that incipient right predominant ATL atrophy is common in TDP-43-C pathology, and that distribution of damage within the ATLs appears to be the same in left- and right-sided variants. Thus, regardless of differences in clinical phenotype and atrophy lateralization, both temporal variants of FTD should be viewed as a spectrum presentation of the same disease.

At the end of this stage, the parasites exit the host cell, after which the progeny invade a new host cell. These processes are rapid and occur in a time-dependent manner. Of particular importance, egress and invasion of erythrocytes by the parasite are difficult to capture in an unsynchronized culture, or even a culture that has been synchronized to within hours. Therefore, precise synchronization of parasite cultures is of paramount importance for the investigation of these processes. Here we describe a method for synchronizing Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi asexual blood stage parasites with ML10, a highly specific inhibitor of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) that arrests parasite growth approximately 15 minutes prior to egress. This inhibitor allows parasite cultures to be synchronized to within minutes, with a simple wash step. Furthermore, we show that parasites remain viable for several hours after becoming arrested by the compound and that ML10 has advantages over the previously used PKG inhibitor Compound 2.

We show that PG editing increases the competitiveness of A. baumannii during bacterial warfare by providing immunity against peptidoglycan-targeting T6SS effectors from various bacterial competitors. We propose that PG editing has evolved as an effective strategy for bacteria to overcome T6SS attacks. In contrast, we found that D-Lys production is detrimental to pathogenesis due, at least in part, to the activity of the human enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), which degrades D-Lys producing H2O2 toxic to bacteria. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the last common ancestor of A. baumannii possessed the ability to produce D-Lys. However, this trait was independently lost multiple times, likely reflecting the evolution of A. baumannii as a human pathogen.

However, functions of the development-specific c-di-GMP diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) CdgB and CdgC, and the phosphodiesterases (PDEs) RmdA and RmdB, are poorly understood. Here, we provide biochemical evidence that the GGDEF-EAL domain protein RmdB from S. venezuelae is a monofunctional PDE that hydrolyzes c-di-GMP to 5pGpG. Despite having an equivalent GGDEF-EAL domain arrangement, RmdA cleaves c-di-GMP to GMP and exhibits residual DGC activity. We show that an intact EAL motif is crucial for the in vivo function of both enzymes since strains expressing protein variants with an AAA motif instead of EAL are delayed in development, similar to null mutants. Global transcriptome analysis of {Delta}cdgB, {Delta}cdgC, {Delta}rmdA and {Delta}rmdB strains revealed that the c-di-GMP specified by these enzymes has a global regulatory role, with about 20 % of all S. venezuelae genes being differentially expressed in the cdgC mutant. Our data suggest that the major c-di-GMP-controlled targets determining the timing and mode of sporulation are genes involved cell division and the production of the hydrophobic sheath that covers Streptomyces aerial hyphae and spores. Altogether, this study provides a global view of the c-di-GMP-dependent genes that contribute to the hyphae-to-spores transition and sheds light on the shared and specific functions of the key enzymes involved in c-di-GMP metabolism in S. venezuelae.

ImportanceStreptomyces are important producers of clinical antibiotics. The ability to synthesize these natural products is connected to their developmental biology, which includes a transition from filamentous cells to spores. The widespread bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP controls this complex switch and is a promising tool to improve antibiotic production. Here, we analyzed the enzymes that make and break c-di-GMP in S. venezuelae by studying the genome-wide transcriptional effects of the DGCs CdgB and CdgC and the PDEs RmdA and RmdB. We found that the c-di-GMP specified by these enzymes has a global regulatory role. However, despite shared enzymatic activities, the four c-di-GMP enzymes have specialized inputs into differentiation. Altogether, we demonstrate that altering c-di-GMP levels through the action of selected enzymes yields characteristically distinct transcriptional profiles; this can be an important consideration when modulating c-di-GMP for the purposes of natural product synthesis in Streptomyces.","NA"

To investigate this, we compared side-by-side sidestream and mainstream PNA biofilms using amplicon sequencing of 16S rDNA and rRNA, hzsB DNA and mRNA, and the genes nxrB, and amoA. The two communities were different to each other with relatively more heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and less anammox bacteria in the mainstream.

However, in both environments Brocadia sapporoensis represented most of the hzsB DNA and mRNA reads, despite the different environmental conditions and nitrogen removal rates. All of those populations present in both sidestream and mainstream had no differences in their 16S rRNA:rDNA ratios, supporting recent findings that rRNA:rDNA ratios are poor indicators of bacterial activity. The observed diversity within functional groups and composition differences between sidestream and mainstream add complexity to our view of PNA communities with possible implication for reactor function.","NA"

Furthermore, outer membrane protein TolB was identified as potential vaccine target with better antigenicity score and allowed for further in silico analysis to design a unique multiepitope subunit vaccine against it. Antigenicity and transmembrane topology screening, allergenicity and toxicity assessment, population coverage analysis, and molecular docking approach were adopted to generate the most potent epitopes.

During meiotic G2/prophase, recombination and chromosome synapsis are monitored by what are considered distinct checkpoints [1-3]. In budding yeast, the AAA+ ATPase Pch2 is thought to specifically promote cell cycle delay in response to synapsis defects [4-6]. However, unperturbed pch2{Delta} cells are delayed in meiotic G2/prophase [6], suggesting paradoxical roles for Pch2 in cell cycle progression. Here, we provide insight into the checkpoint roles of Pch2 and its connection to Hop1, a HORMA domain-containing client protein. Contrary to current understanding, we find that the Pch2-Hop1 module is crucial for checkpoint function in response to both recombination and synapsis defects, thus revealing a shared meiotic checkpoint cascade. Meiotic checkpoint responses are transduced by DNA break-dependent phosphorylation of Hop1 [7, 8]. Based on our data and on the effect of Pch2 on HORMA topology [9-11], we propose that Pch2 promotes checkpoint proficiency by catalyzing the availability of signaling-competent Hop1. Conversely, we demonstrate that Pch2 can act as a checkpoint silencer, also in the face of persistent DNA repair defects. We establish a framework in which Pch2 and Hop1 form a homeostatic module that governs general meiotic checkpoint function. We show that this module can - depending on the cellular context - fuel or extinguish meiotic checkpoint function, which explains the contradictory roles of Pch2 in cell cycle control. Within the meiotic checkpoint, the Pch2-Hop1 module thus operates analogous to the Pch2/TRIP13-Mad2 module in the spindle assembly checkpoint that monitors chromosome segregation [12-16].","NA"

Evidence from post-mortem brain studies using adult brains have indicated that early prenatal development may be altered in autism. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from autistic individuals with macrocephaly also indicate prenatal development as a critical period for this condition. But little is known about early altered cellular events during prenatal stages in autism.

MethodsIPSCs were generated from 9 unrelated autistic individuals without macrocephaly and with heterogeneous genetic backgrounds, and 6 typically developing, control, individuals. IPSCs were differentiated towards either cortical or midbrain fates. Gene expression and high throughput cellular phenotyping was used to characterise iPSCs at different stage of differentiation.

ResultsA subset of autism-iPSC cortical neurons were RNA-sequenced to reveal autism-specific signatures similar to post-mortem brain studies, indicating a potential common biological mechanism. Autism-iPSCs differentiated towards a cortical fate displayed impairments in the ability to self-form into neural rosettes. In addition, autism-iPSCs demonstrated significant differences in rate of cell type assignment of cortical precursors, and dorsal and ventral forebrain precursors. These cellular phenotypes occurred in the absence of alterations in cell proliferation during cortical differentiation, differing from previous studies. Acquisition of cell fate during midbrain differentiation was not different between control- and autism-iPSCs.

ConclusionsTaken together, our data indicate that autism-iPSCs diverge from control-iPSCs at a cellular level during early stage of neurodevelopment. This suggests that unique developmental differences associated with autism may be established at early prenatal stages.","NA"

The experimental discovery of miRNAs is complicated because both miRNAs and their targets need to be expressed for the confirmation of functional interactions, but expression is under spatiotemporal control. This has motivated the development of computational methods for miRNA detection. This typically involves feature design by domain experts followed by machine learning. While handcrafted features can encode domain knowledge, feature engineering is a time-consuming task. Additionally, some of the currently most successful features for pre-miRNA detection, such as p-value based ones, require comparably large computations. In contrast, advances of representation learning methods such as deep learning can discover relevant features directly from data. Here, we propose a method that uses domain knowledge to create an efficient graphical representation of pre-miRNAs, encoding sequence, structure, and implicitly some thermodynamic information.

These effector responses have been hypothesised to exhibit different antigen dose and affinity thresholds, suggesting that pathogen-specific information may be encoded within the nature of the antigen. Here, using systematic experiments in a reductionist system, where primary human CD8+ T cell blasts are stimulated by recombinant pMHC antigen alone, we show that different inflammatory cytokines have comparable antigen dose thresholds across a 25,000-fold variation in affinity. Although co-stimulation by CD28, CD2, and CD27 increased cytokine production in this system, the antigen threshold remained comparable across different cytokines. When using primary human memory CD8+ T cells responding to autologous antigen presenting cells equivalent thresholds were also observed for cytokine production and killing. These findings imply a simple phenotypic model of TCR signalling where multiple T cell responses share a common rate-limiting threshold and a conceptually simple model of antigen recognition, where the chance factor of antigen dose and affinity do not provide any additional response-specific information.","NA"

Previous work has identified components required for the expansion of the ring canal actin cytoskeleton but has not identified the proteins responsible for F-actin recruitment or accumulation. Using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutagenesis and UAS-Gal4 overexpression, we show that HtsRC, a component specific to female germline ring canals, is both necessary and sufficient to drive F-actin accumulation. Absence of HtsRC in the germline resulted in ring canals lacking inner rim F-actin, while overexpression of HtsRC led to larger ring canals. HtsRC functions in combination with Filamin to recruit F-actin to ring-canal-like ectopic actin structures in somatic follicle cells. Finally, we present findings which indicate that HtsRC expression and robust female germline ring canal expansion are important for high fecundity in fruit flies but dispensable for their fertility, a result which is consistent with our understanding of HtsRC as a newly evolved gene specific to female germline ring canals.","NA"

Amongst other features, NF1 patients frequently show reduced muscle mass and strength, impairing patients mobility and increasing the risk of fall. The role of Nf1 in muscle and the cause for the NF1-associated myopathy is mostly unknown.

MethodsTo dissect the function of Nf1 in muscle, we created muscle-specific knockout mouse models for Nf1, inactivating Nf1 in the prenatal myogenic lineage either under the Lbx1 promoter or under the Myf5 promoter. Mice were analyzed during pre-and postnatal myogenesis and muscle growth.

ResultsNf1Lbx1 and Nf1Myf5 animals showed only mild defects in prenatal myogenesis. Nf1Lbx1 animals were perinatally lethal, while Nf1Myf5 animals survived only up to approx. 25 weeks. A comprehensive phenotypic characterization of Nf1Myf5 animals showed decreased postnatal growth, reduced muscle size, and fast fiber atrophy. Proteome and transcriptome analysis of muscle tissue indicated decreased protein synthesis and increased proteasomal degradation, and decreased glycolytic and increased oxidative activity in muscle tissue. High-resolution respirometry confirmed enhanced oxidative metabolism in Nf1Myf5 muscles, which was concomitant to a fiber type shift from type 2B to type 2A and type 1. Moreover, Nf1Myf5 muscles showed hallmarks of decreased activation of mTORC1 and increased expression of atrogenes. Remarkably, loss of Nf1 promoted a robust activation of AMPK with a gene expression profile indicative of increased fatty acid catabolism. Additionally, we observed a strong induction of genes encoding catabolic cytokines in muscle Nf1Myf5 animals, in line with a drastic reduction of white, but not brown adipose tissue.

ConclusionsOur results demonstrate a cell-autonomous role for Nf1 in myogenic cells during postnatal muscle growth required for metabolic and proteostatic homeostasis. Furthermore, Nf1 deficiency in muscle drives cross-tissue communication and mobilization of lipid reserves.","NA"

Despite the widespread observation on the osteogenic effects of Mg2+, the diverse roles played by Mg2+ in the complex biological process of bone healing have not been systematically dissected. Here, we reveal a previously unknown biphasic mode of action of Mg2+ in bone repair. In the early inflammation phase, Mg2+ primarily targets the monocyte-macrophage lineage to promote their recruitment, activation, and polarization. We showed that an increase in extracellular Mg2+ contributes to an upregulated expression of transient receptor potential cation channel member 7 (TRPM7) and a TRPM7-dependent influx of Mg2+ in the monocyte-macrophage lineage, resulting in the cleavage and nuclear accumulation of TRPM7-cleaved kinase fragments (M7CKs). This then triggers the phosphorylation of Histone H3 at serine 10, in a TRPM7-dependent manner at the promoters of inflammatory cytokines like IL-8, leading to the formation of a pro-osteogenic immune microenvironment. In the later active repair/remodeling phase of bone healing, however, continued exposure of Mg2+ and IL-8 leads to over activation of NF-{kappa}B signaling in macrophages, turning the immune microenvironment into pro-osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, the presence of Mg2+ at this stage also decelerates bone maturation through the suppression of hydroxyapatite precipitation. The negative effects of Mg2+ on osteogenesis can override the initial pro-osteogenic benefits of Mg2+, as we found prolonged delivery of Mg2+ compromises overall bone formation. Taken together, this study establishes a paradigm shift in understanding the diverse and multifaceted roles of Mg2+ in bone healing.","NA"

A genome-wide screen now revealed that Art2/Ecm21, a member of the -arrestin family of Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase adaptors, is required for the simultaneous endocytosis of four AATs and induced during starvation by the general amino acid control pathway. Art2 uses a basic patch to recognize C-terminal acidic sorting motifs in these AATs and instructs Rsp5 to ubiquitinate proximal lysine residues. In response to amino acid excess, Rsp5 instead uses TORC1-activated Art1 to detect N-terminal acidic sorting motifs within the same AATs, which initiates exclusive substrate-induced endocytosis of individual AATs. Thus, amino acid availability activates complementary -arrestin-Rsp5-complexes to control selective endocytosis for nutrient acquisition.","NA"

While X-ray and cryo-EM snapshots of MHC-I in complex with TAPBPR and tapasin, respectively, have provided important insights into the peptide-deficient MHC-I groove structure, the molecular mechanism through which these chaperones influence the selection of specific amino acid sequences remains incompletely characterized. Of particular importance is a 16 residue loop in TAPBPR (corresponding to 11 residues in tapasin), which has been proposed to actively compete with incoming peptides by forming direct contacts in the F-pocket of the empty MHC-I groove. Using a deep mutational scanning functional analysis of TAPBPR, we find that important residues for the chaperoning activity are located on the major interaction surfaces with nascent MHC-I molecules, excluding the loop. However, interactions with properly conformed molecules toward peptide editing are influenced by loop mutations, in an MHC-I allele- and peptide-dependent manner. Detailed biophysical characterization by ITC, FP and NMR reveals that the loop does not interact with the peptide-deficient MHC-I groove to compete with incoming peptides, but instead promotes peptide loading by acting as a kinetic trap. Our results suggest that the longer loop of TAPBPR lowers the affinity threshold for peptide selection, to promote loading within subcellular compartments of reduced peptide concentration and to prevent disassembly of high affinity peptide-MHC-I complexes that are transiently interrogated by TAPBPR during editing.","NA"

To better understand the ecology of bacteria important for C. difficile colonization resistance, we developed an experimental platform to simplify complex communities of fecal bacteria through dilution and rapidly screen for their ability to inhibit C. difficile in vitro. We simplified complex communities from six fecal donors and found that 17% of simplified communities inhibited C. difficile growth when initially isolated and when re-cultured from frozen stocks. Composition varied between simplified communities based upon fecal donor used for dilution; complexity ranged from 19-67 OTUs. One simplified community could be further simplified through dilution and retain the ability to inhibit C. difficile. We tested efficacy of seven simplified communities in a humanized microbiota mouse model and found that four communities were able to significantly reduce the severity of the initial C. difficile infection and limit susceptibility to disease relapse. Analysis of fecal microbiomes from treated mice demonstrated that simplified communities accelerated recovery of endogenous bacteria and led to stable engraftment of at least 20% of bacteria from simplified communities. Overall, the insights gained through the identification and characterization of these simplified communities increase our understanding of the microbial dynamics of C. difficile infection and recovery.

ImportanceClostridioides difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and a significant healthcare burden. While fecal microbiota transplantation is highly effective at treating recurrent C. difficile disease, uncertainties about the undefined composition of fecal material and potential long-term unintended health consequences have motivated studies to identify new communities of simple microbes that will be effective at treating disease. This work describes a platform for rapidly identifying and screening new simplified communities of microbes for efficacy in treating C. difficile infection and identifies four new simplified communities of microbes with potential for development of new therapies to treat C. difficile disease in humans. While this platform was developed and validated to model infection with C. difficile, the underlying principles described in the paper could be easily modified to develop therapeutics to treat other gastrointestinal diseases.","NA"

The ability of drug cues to trigger relapse is believed to be a consequence of incentive salience attribution, a process in which the incentive value of reward is transferred to the reward-paired cue. Sign-tracker (ST) rats that attribute enhanced incentive value to reward cues are more prone to relapse compared to goal-tracker (GT) rats that primarily attribute predictive value to such cues. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this individual variation in relapse propensity remains largely unexplored. The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) has been identified as a critical node in the regulation of cue-elicited behaviors in STs and GTs, including cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. Here we used a chemogenetic approach to assess whether ""top-down"" cortical input from the prelimbic cortex (PrL) to the PVT plays a role in mediating individual differences in relapse propensity. Chemogenetic inhibition of the PrL-PVT pathway differentially affected neuronal activity (i.e. Fos) in the PVT in STs compared to GTs. This manipulation also selectively decreased cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior in STs, without affecting behavior in GTs. In contrast, cocaine-primed drug-seeking behavior was unaffected in both phenotypes. These results highlight an important role for the PrL-PVT circuit in mediating individual differences in cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior, or relapse propensity.","NA"

By virtue of a branched N-acylamide side chain, GalNAzMe is not interconverted by epimerization to the corresponding N-acetylglucosamine analog like conventional GalNAc-based probes. GalNAzMe enters O-GalNAc glycosylation but does not enter other major cell surface glycan types including Asn (N)-linked glycans. We equip cells with the capacity to biosynthesize the nucleotide-sugar donor UDP-GalNAzMe from a caged precursor. Tagged with a bioorthogonal azide group, GalNAzMe serves as an O-glycan specific reporter in superresolution microscopy, chemical glycoproteomics, a genome-wide CRISPR knock-out (KO) screen, and imaging of intestinal organoids. GalNAzMe is a precision tool that allows a detailed view into the biology of a major type of cancer-relevant protein glycosylation.

Significance statementA large portion of all secreted and cell surface proteins in humans are modified by Ser/Thr(O)-linked glycosylation with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). While of fundamental importance in health and disease, O-GalNAc glycosylation is technically challenging to study because of a lack of specific tools to be used in biological assays. Here, we design an O-GalNAc specific reporter molecule termed GalNAzMe to selectively label O-GalNAc glycoproteins in living human cells. GalNAzMe is compatible with a range of experiments in quantitative biology to broaden our understanding of glycosylation. We further demonstrate that labeling is genetically programmable by expression of a mutant glycosyltransferase, allowing application even to experiments with low inherent sensitivity.","NA"

In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, Sex Peptide (SP) is the best-characterised protein mediator of these effects. It is secreted from the paired male accessory glands (AGs), which, like the mammalian prostate and seminal vesicles, generate most of the seminal fluid contents. After mating, SP binds to spermatozoa and is retained in the female sperm storage organs. It is gradually released by proteolytic cleavage and induces several long-term post-mating responses including ovulation, elevated feeding and reduced receptivity to remating, primarily signalling through the SP receptor (SPR). Here, we demonstrate a previously unsuspected SPR-independent function for SP. We show that, in the AG lumen, SP and secreted proteins with membrane-binding anchors are carried on abundant, large neutral lipid-containing microcarriers, also found in other SP-expressing Drosophila species. These microcarriers are transferred to females during mating, where they rapidly disassemble. Remarkably, SP is a key assembly factor for microcarriers and is also required for the female disassembly process to occur normally. Males expressing non-functional SP mutant proteins that affect SPs binding to and release from sperm in females also do not produce normal microcarriers, suggesting that this male-specific defect contributes to the resulting widespread defects in ejaculate function. Our data therefore reveal a novel role for SP in formation of seminal macromolecular assemblies, which may explain the presence of SP in Drosophila species, which lack the signalling functions seen in D. melanogaster.

Significance StatementSeminal fluid plays a critical role in reprogramming female physiology and behaviour to promote male reproductive success. We show in the fruit fly that specific seminal proteins, including the archetypal  female-reprogramming molecule Sex Peptide, are stored in male seminal secretions in association with large neutral lipid-containing microcarriers, which rapidly disperse in females. Related structures are also observed in other Sex Peptide-expressing Drosophila species. Males lacking Sex Peptide have structurally defective microcarriers, leading to abnormal cargo loading and transfer to females. Our data reveal that this key signalling molecule in Drosophila seminal fluid is also a microcarrier assembly factor that controls transfer of other seminal factors, and that this may be a more evolutionarily ancient role of this protein.","NA"

Currently, there are no vaccines or drugs available for nCovid-19, hence early detection is crucial to help and manage the outbreak. Here, we report an in-house built biosensor device (eCovSens) and compare it with a commercial potentiostat for the detection of nCovid-19 spike antigen (nCovid-19Ag) in spiked saliva samples. A potentiostat based sensor was fabricated using fluorine doped tin oxide electrode (FTO) with gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) and immobilized with nCovid-19 monoclonal antibody (nCovid-19Ab) to measure change in the electrical conductivity. Similarly, eCovSens was used to measure change in electrical conductivity by immobilizing nCovid-19 Ab on screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The performances of both sensors were recorded upon interaction of nCovid-19Ab with its specific nCovid-19Ag. Under optimum conditions, the FTO based immunosensor and eCovSens displayed high sensitivity for detection of nCovid-19Ag, ranging from 1 fM to 1 M. Our in-house developed device can successfully detect nCovid-19Ag at 10 fM concentration in standard buffer that is in close agreement with FTO/AuNPs sensor. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 90 fM with eCovSens and 120 fM with potentiostst in case of spiked saliva samples. The proposed portable eCovSens device can be used as a diagnostic tool for the rapid (within 10-30 s) detection of nCovid-19Ag traces directly in patient saliva in a non-invasive manner.","NA"

However, experimental identification of these potential antibiotic target proteins can be labor-intensive and challenging, as these proteins are likely to be poorly characterized and specific to few bacteria. In order to identify these novel proteins, we established a Large-Scale Transcriptomic Analysis Pipeline in Crowd (LSTrAP-Crowd), where 285 individuals processed 26 terabytes of RNA-sequencing data of the 17 most notorious bacterial pathogens. In total, the crowd processed 26,269 RNA-seq experiments and used the data to construct gene co-expression networks, which were used to identify more than a hundred uncharacterized genes that were transcriptionally associated with protein synthesis.

Here, focusing on Rabies lyssavirus, a globally important zoonosis, we developed a pseudotype micro-neutralization rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (pmRFFIT) that overcomes these limitations. Specifically, we adapted an existing micro-neutralization test to use a green fluorescent protein-tagged murine leukemia virus pseudotype in lieu of pathogenic rabies virus, reducing the need for specialized reagents for antigen detection and enabling use in low-containment laboratories. We further used statistical analysis to generate rapid, quantitative predictions of the probability and titer of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies from microscopic imaging of neutralization outcomes. Using 47 serum samples from domestic dogs with neutralizing antibody titers estimated using the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVN), pmRFFIT showed moderate sensitivity (78.79%) and high specificity (84.62%). Despite small conflicts, titer predictions were correlated across tests repeated on different dates both for dog samples (r = 0.93), and for a second dataset of sera from wild common vampire bats (r = 0.72, N = 41), indicating repeatability. Our test uses a starting volume of 3.5 L of serum, estimates titers from a single dilution of serum rather than requiring multiple dilutions and end point titration, and may be adapted to target neutralizing antibodies against alternative lyssavirus species. The pmRFFIT enables high-throughput detection of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies in low-biocontainment settings and is suited to studies in wild or captive animals where large serum volumes cannot be obtained.","NA"

Fast identification of virus-host interactions can reveal mechanistic insights of infectious diseases and shed light on potential treatments and drug discoveries. Current computational prediction methods for novel viruses are based only on protein sequences. Yet, it is not clear to what extent other important features, such as the symptoms caused by the viruses, could contribute to a predictor. Disease phenotypes (i.e., symptoms) are readily accessible from clinical diagnosis and we hypothesize that they may act as a potential proxy and an additional source of information for the underlying molecular interactions between the pathogens and hosts.

ResultsWe developed DeepViral, a deep learning method that predicts potential protein-protein interactions between human and viruses. First, human proteins and viruses were embedded in a shared space using their associated phenotypes, functions, taxonomic classification, as well as formalized background knowledge from biomedical ontologies. By extending a sequence learning model with phenotype features, our model can not only significantly improve over previous sequence-based approaches for inter-species interaction prediction, but also identify pathways of viral targets under a realistic experimental setup for novel viruses.

In this study, we collected rhizosphere samples from Fujian province, the microbiota in the root and mycorrhizal rhizosphere were identified by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. First, we compared three types of fungal communities: root tips infected with ECM Russula (type 1), tips with Russula sporocarp (type 2) and tips without ECM (type 3). Our results showed that the fungal richness was negatively correlated with Russula. Russula, Tomentella and Lactarius were common in Fagaceae ECM roots. As to the mycorrhizal interactions, Boletus may be considered as an indicator species for sporocarp-producing Russula, and Acremonium, Cladophialophora were associated with Russula symbiosis. Second, we analyzed the fungal and bacterial communities in rhizosphere soils from the corresponding to previously three types (type 1, 2, 3). Dacryobolus and Acidocella may be considered as an indicator species for sporocarp-producing Russula. Fungi Tomentella, Saitozyma, Elaphomyces and bacteria Acidicaldus, Bryobacter, Sorangium and Acidobacterium occurred more frequently in the ECM Russula rhizosphere.

Biologically functional interactions are expected to occur more frequently than random (background) interactions. To identify biologically relevant interactions, several background models that take biases such as distance, GC content and mappability into account have been proposed. Here we introduce MaxHiC, a background correction tool that deals with these complex biases and robustly identifies statistically significant interactions in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments. MaxHiC uses a negative binomial distribution model and a maximum likelihood technique to correct biases in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C libraries. We systematically benchmark MaxHiC against major Hi-C background correction tools and demonstrate using published Hi-C and capture Hi-C datasets that 1) Interacting regions identified by MaxHiC have significantly greater levels of overlap with known regulatory features (e.g. active chromatin histone marks, CTCF binding sites, DNase sensitivity) and also disease-associated genome-wide association SNPs than those identified by currently existing models, and 2) the pairs of interacting regions are more likely to be linked by eQTL pairs and more likely to identify known enhancer-promoter pairs than any of the existing methods.

According to the social complexity hypothesis, communication complexity tends to increase with an increase in social complexity. While several studies on mammalian systems exist supporting this, evidence from avian systems is comparatively limited. Towards this, we present evidence for complex acoustic communication in a cooperatively breeding passerine, Jungle Babbler, based on three aspects of complexity: an extensive repertoire of acoustically-distinct calls, within-call structural complexity and the diverse behavioural contexts in which these calls are used. Jungle Babblers were found to possess a structurally and functionally diverse vocal repertoire comprising 15 different calls. Detailed acoustic analyses of multisyllabic calls revealed that these calls are composed of different notes. Further, despite a large number of notes present in the repertoire, the number of calls were limited to 15. This implies that there may be underlying rules that determine call composition to give rise to functional calls to which receivers respond. We also found that these calls were produced in a variety of affiliative and agonistic contexts and were employed towards coordination of diverse social behaviours including group movement, foraging, brood care, aggression and vigilance. Yet, 7 out of 15 vocalizations were produced in the context of vigilance. This disproportionate investment of vocalizations towards co-ordinated acoustic vigilance is characteristic of many cooperatively breeding birds. Our study extends support for the social complexity hypothesis and also lays the foundation for future investigations on combinatorial and syntactical rules underlying call structure and function in bird vocalizations.

Significance statementStudies on vocal complexity in birds have focussed mainly on repertoire size, structure and function. However, fine temporal and spectral features of elements that constitute a call/song are rarely examined to evaluate vocal complexity. We examined complex communication in a cooperatively breeding social passerine, Jungle Babbler for which we assessed repertoire size, function, acoustic features of calls and of their constituent elements. Jungle Babblers were found to possess a structurally and functionally diverse vocal repertoire comprising of 15 calls, 46% of which were in the context of vigilance, thereby extending support to the social complexity hypothesis. We also found that several calls were composed of multiple, acoustically distinct notes. These findings will be foundational in understanding the interrelations between sociality and communicative complexity and underlying combinatorial rules that determine call structure and function.","NA"

The Asgard genome encodes a variety of eukaryotic signature proteins previously unseen in prokaryotes. Functional and structural characterization of these proteins is beginning to shed light on the complexity and pedigree of the ancestral eukaryotic cell5,6. In eukaryotes, the key cytoskeletal protein actin is important for diverse cellular processes such as membrane remodeling and cell motility7. Dynamic polymerization of actin provides both structure and generates the force which drives motility and membrane remodeling. These processes demand rapid filament assembly and disassembly on microsecond timescales. In eukaryotes, a variety of highly adapted proteins including gelsolin, profilin, VASP, ARP2/3 and signaling molecules (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)) are crucial for organizing cellular cytoskeleton dynamics. Amongst others, the Asgard genomes encode predicted putative profilin homologues that regulate eukaryotic actin polymerization in vitro5,8. Interestingly, Asgard profilins appear to be regulated by PIP2, but not by polyproline rich motifs which are important for recruitment of actin:profilin complexes in eukaryotes5,9. These findings indicate that the Asgard archaea may have possessed analogous membrane organization to present-day eukaryotes, but that polyproline-mediated profilin regulation may have emerge later in the eukaryotic lineage5. Here, we show that Heimdallarchaeota, a candidate phylum within the Asgard superphylum, encodes a putative profilin (heimProfilin) that interacts with PIP2 and is regulated by polyproline motifs, implicative of an origin predating the rise of the eukaryotes. Additionally, we provide evidence for a novel regulatory mechanism whereby an extended N-terminal loop abolishes PIP2 and polyproline interactions. Lastly, we provide the first evidence for actin polymerization of an Asgard actin homologue. In context, these findings provide further evidence for the existence of a complex cytoskeleton already in Last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA).","NA"

We have proposed that these component accept-reject decisions may have some kinship with stopping decisions. One prediction of this idea is that stopping and choice may reflect similar neural processes occurring in overlapping brain circuits. To test the idea, we recorded neuronal activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) Area 13 while macaques performed a stop signal task interleaved with a structurally matched choice task. Using neural network decoders, we find that OFC ensembles have overlapping codes for stopping and choice: the decoder that was only trained to identify accept vs. reject trials performed with higher efficiency even when tested on the stop trials. These results provide tentative support for the idea that mechanisms underlying inhibitory control and choice selection may be subject to theoretical unification.","NA"

Using a contextual fear conditioning procedure in rats and midazolam as amnestic agent, we recently demonstrated that drug-induced amnesia can also be obtained when memories are reactivated through exposure to a generalization stimulus (GS, context B) and later tested for that same generalization stimulus (ABB design). However, this amnestic intervention leaves fear expression intact when at test animals are instead presented with the original training stimulus (ABA design) or a novel generalization stimulus (ABC design). The underlying mechanisms of post-reactivation memory malleability and of MDZ-induced amnesia for a generalization context remain largely unknown. Here, we evaluated whether, like typical CS-mediated (or AAA) post-reactivation amnesia, GS-mediated (ABB) post-reactivation amnesia displays key features of a destabilization-based phenomenon. We first show that ABB post-reactivation amnesia is critically dependent on prediction error at the time of memory reactivation and provide evidence for its temporally graded nature. In line with the known role of GluN2B-NMDA receptor activation in memory destabilization, we further demonstrate that pre-reactivation administration of ifenprodil, a selective antagonist of GluN2B-NMDA receptors, prevents MDZ-induced ABB amnesia.

To flexibly influence offspring, mothers should be able to transmit the hormonal signals independent of their own hormonal status. However, the ability to regulate hormone transfer to the next generation is under debate. We studied the transfer of thyroid hormones (THs) to eggs in a bird model. We elevated thyroxine (T4, the prohormone for the biological active triiodothyronine, T3) during egg-laying using T4 implants on females of a wild population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), and measured plasma and yolk T4 and T3 as a response. To our knowledge, studies that manipulated a prohormone and measured the change in its active metabolites have rarely been conducted. We found an increase in plasma and yolk T4 and no change in T3 concentrations leading to a similar decrease in yolk T3/T4 ratio in response to the T4 treatment in plasma and yolk. This suggests that mothers are able to regulate the conversion of T4 in T3 to avoid potential costs of elevated exposure to the active hormone to herself and to her progeny. Finally, contrary to our predictions, we found no evidence of regulatory mechanisms at the follicle level, which is essential for independent regulation of yolk hormone transfer.

Summary statementThyroid hormones have been overlooked in the context of hormone-mediated maternal effects. We found that mothers may regulate yolk thyroid hormone transfer by regulating the conversion of the active form of the hormone.","NA"

Extrusion of the chloroplast membrane with amoeboid-shaped appearance was observed in infected mesophyll cells. These alterations were associated with lower relative chlorophyll content, and reduced PSII efficiency and CO2 fixation. Moreover, an oxidative stress process was observed in CsCMV-infected plants. Strong declines in the maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry (Fv/Fm) were observed in infected plants. Furthermore, the analysis of Chlorophyll-a fluorescence (ChlF) evidenced a progressive loss of both oxygen evolving complex activity and ""connectivity"" within the tripartite system (core antenna-LHCII-Reaction Centre). Other effects of the pathogen included reduction of starch and maltose content in source leaves, and a significant increase of the sucrose/starch ratio, which indicates alteration pattern of carbon. Our results suggest that CsCMV induces chloroplast distortion associated with progressive chloroplast function loss and diversion of carbon flux in source leaf tissue, which should be key in inducing yield losses of infected crops.

Their biomonitoring has been progressively supported by DNA-based tools whose performance and accuracy rely on validated reference datasets that, in some cases, are lacking or do not cover important biogeographical centres of diversification. This study reports the results of a DNA barcoding campaign on Odonata, involving the collection of 812 specimens (448 of which barcoded) from Italy and its main islands (328 localities), belonging to the 88 species (31 Zygoptera and 57 Anisoptera) inhabiting the country. Additional BOLD and GenBank data from Holarctic samples of the same taxa expanded the dataset to 1294 DNA barcodes. An integrative species delimitation analysis involving two distance (OT and ABGD) and four tree-based (PTP, MPTP, GMYC, bGMYC) approaches identified warnings of possible taxonomic relevance. Of the 88 investigated species, 85% could be successfully identified by their DNA barcodes, with damselflies showing a percentage of warnings (29%) higher than dragonflies (7%), contrasting with the other available DNA barcoding studies on Odonata (showing up to 95% of identification success). The species causing warnings were grouped in three categories depending on if they showed low, high or mixed genetic divergence patterns. Moreover, for the second class of warnings, the analysis of haplotypes revealed unexpected structure at the Italian, Palearctic and Holarctic scale. Overall, the DNA barcoding inventory assembled in this study will provide valuable insights into the systematics and conservation of many odonate species with implications for future DNA and eDNA monitoring-based studies.","NA"

For computational prediction, due to the lack of detailed knowledge on the folding driving forces, how to design an energy function is still an open question. Furthermore, an effective criterion to evaluate the performance of the energy function is also lacking. Here we present a novel knowledge-based-energy scoring function, simply considering the interactions of peptide bonds, rather than, as conventionally, the residues or atoms as the most important energy contribution. This energy scoring was evaluated by selecting the X-ray structure from a large number of possibilities. It not only outperforms the best of the previously published statistical potentials, but also has very low computational expense. Besides, we suggest an alternative criterion to evaluate the performance of the energy scoring function, measured by the template modeling score of the selected rank-one. We argue that the comparison should allow for some deviation between the x-ray and predicted structures. Collectively, this accurate and simple energy scoring function, together with the optimized criterion, will significantly advance the computational protein structure prediction.","NA"

On the other hand, energy limits computation, be it neural and probabilistic or digital and logical. After establishing an energy-efficient viewpoint, we define computation and construct an energy-constrained, computational function that can be optimized. This function implies a specific distinction between ATP-consuming processes, especially computation per se vs action potentials and other costs of communication. As a result, the partitioning of ATP-consumption here differs from earlier work. A bits/J optimization of computation requires an energy audit of the human brain. Instead of using the oft-quoted 20 watts of glucose available to the brain (1, 2), the partitioning and audit reveals that cortical computation consumes 0.2 watts of ATP while long-distance communication costs are over 20-fold greater. The bits/joule computational optimization implies a transient information rate of more than 7 bits/sec/neuron.

Significance StatementEngineers hold up the human brain as a low energy form of computation. However from the simplest physical viewpoint, a neurons computation cost is remarkably larger than the best possible bits/joule - off by a factor of 108. Here we explicate, in the context of energy consumption, a definition of neural computation that is optimal given explicit constraints. The plausibility of this definition as Natures perspective is supported by an energy-audit of the human brain. The audit itself requires certain novel perspectives and calculations revealing that communication costs are 20-fold computational costs.","NA"

This task is complicated by the fact that many diseases are heterogeneous at the molecular level and samples representing distinct disease subtypes may demonstrate different patterns of dysregulation. Biclustering methods are capable of identifying genes that follow a similar expression pattern only in a subset of samples and hence can consider disease heterogeneity. However, identifying biologically significant and reproducible sets of genes and samples remains challenging for the existing tools. Many recent studies have shown that the integration of gene expression and protein interaction data improves the robustness of prediction and classification and advances biomarker discovery.

ResultsHere we present DESMOND, a new method for identification of Differentially ExpreSsed gene MOdules iN Diseases. DESMOND performs network-constrained biclustering on gene expression data and identifies gene modules -- connected sets of genes up- or down-regulated in subsets of samples. We applied DESMOND on expression profiles of samples from two large breast cancer cohorts and have shown that the capability of DESMOND to incorporate protein interactions allows identifying the biologically meaningful gene and sample subsets and improves the reproducibility of the results.

Recent research on mammals found that neutrophil concentrations scaled hypermetrically with body mass, a result not predicted by any existing theory. Although this mammalian model might predict how leukocyte concentrations scale with body mass in other vertebrates, vertebrate classes are distinct in many ways that might affect their current and historic interactions with parasites and hence the evolution of their immune systems. Subsequently, here, we asked which existing scaling hypothesis best-predicted relationships between body mass and lymphocyte, eosinophil, and heterophil concentrations--the avian functional equivalent of neutrophils--among >100 species of birds. We then examined the predictive power of body mass relative to life-history variation, as an extensive literature indicates that the scheduling of key life events has influenced immune system variation among species. Finally, we ask whether these scaling patterns differ from the patterns we observed in mammals. We found that an intercept-only model best-explained lymphocyte and eosinophil concentrations among birds; body mass minimally influenced these two cell types. For heterophils, however, body mass explained over 30% of the variation in concentrations among species, much more than life-history variation (~8%). As with mammalian neutrophils, avian heterophils scaled hypermetrically (b=0.19 {+/-} 0.05), but significantly steeper than mammals (~1.5x). As such, we discuss why birds might require more broadly-protective cells compared to mammals of the same body size. Body mass appears to have strong influences on the architecture of immune systems, which could impact host-parasite coevolution and even zoonotic disease risk for humans.","NA"

Here we show conpopulation sperm precedence between Drosophila montana populations. Using genomic data to estimate divergence times and patterns of gene flow between populations, we show gene flow has played a considerable role during divergence. We find conpopulation sperm precedence is asymmetric and is concordant with asymmetry in non-competitive postmating prezygotic reproductive isolation. These results suggest these phenomena have a shared mechanism, but we show that this asymmetry is unrelated to the strength of postcopulatory sexual selection acting within populations. We tested whether overlapping foreign and coevolved ejaculates within the female reproductive tract altered fertilisation success but found no effect. Our results show that neither time since divergence nor sperm competitiveness predicts the strength of postmating prezygotic reproductive isolation.

CIPN can have a prolonged effect on quality of life. Chemotherapy treatment is often reduced or stopped altogether because of the severe pain. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for CIPN partially due to its complex pathogenesis in multiple pathways involving a variety of channels, specifically, voltage-gated ion channels. A surrogate of neuropathic pain in an in vitro setting is hyperexcitability in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) peripheral sensory neurons. Our study employs bifurcation theory to investigate the role of voltage-gated ion channels in inducing hyperexcitability as a consequence of spontaneous firing, due to the common chemotherapy agent paclitaxel. Our mathematical investigation suggests that the sodium channel Nav1.8 and the delayed rectifier potassium channel conductances are the most critical for hyperexcitability in normal firing small DRG neurons. Introducing paclitaxel into the model, our bifurcation analysis predicts that hyperexcitability is extreme for a medium dose of paclitaxel, which is validated by multi-electrode array recordings. Our findings using multi-electrode array experiments reveal that the Nav1.8 blocker A-803467 and the delayed rectifier potassium enhancer L-alpha-phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol 4,5-diphosphate, dioctanoyl (PIP2) have a protective effect on the firing rate of DRG when administered separately together with paclitaxel as suggested by our bifurcation analysis.","NA"

However, the action of the ECM on synaptic plasticity remains controversial. Here, we employed serial section electron microscopy to show that enzymatic attenuation of ECM with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) triggers the appearance of new glutamatergic synapses onto thin dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons. The appearance of new synapses increased the ratio of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) to presynaptic fiber volley (PrV), suggesting that these new synapses are formed on existing axonal fibers. However, both the mean miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude and AMPA/NMDA ratio were decreased, suggesting that ECM attenuation increased the proportion of 'unpotentiated' synapses. A higher proportion of unpotentiated synapses would be expected to promote long-term potentiation (LTP). Surprisingly, theta-burst induced LTP was suppressed by ChABC treatment. The suppression of LTP was accompanied by decreased excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons due to the upregulation of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels. A pharmacological blockade of SK channels restored cell excitability and, expectedly, enhanced LTP above the level of control. This enhancement of LTP was abolished by a blockade of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), which is involved in the maturation of dendritic spines. Thus, ECM attenuation enables the appearance of new synapses in the hippocampus, which is compensated for by a reduction in the excitability of postsynaptic neurons, thereby preventing network overexcitation at the expense of synaptic plasticity.","NA"

Notably, marine heat waves are producing widespread coral bleaching events with increased frequency, with projections for annual bleaching events on many reefs by mid-century. The response of corals to elevated seawater temperatures is, however, influenced by a combination of environmental legacies, the biology of the host, and the resident symbiont community, each of which have the capacity to modulate resistance and resilience to environmental stress. It is critical, therefore, to evaluate the potential for shifting physiological and molecular baselines driven by these factors in back-to-back in situ bleaching (and recovery) events given the potential for mortality of corals in response to episodic bleaching episodes and increased ocean warming. Here, we use the regional bleaching events of 2014 and 2015 in the Hawaiian Islands and subsequent recovery periods to test the hypothesis that coral multivariate responses (physiotypes) differed in back-to-back bleaching events, modulated by both environmental histories and symbiotic partnerships (Symbiodiniaceaea). Bleaching severity was greater in the first-bleaching event, and concomitantly, environmental history effects were more pronounced. Melanin, an immune cytotoxic response, provided an initial defense during the first-bleaching event and primed antioxidant activity, which peaked in the second-bleaching event. While magnitude of bleaching differed, immune response patterns were shared among corals harboring heat-sensitive and heat-tolerant Symbiodiniaceae. This supports a pattern of increased constitutive immunity in corals during repeat bleaching events, demonstrated by greater specialized enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase) and attenuated melanin synthesis. This study demonstrates bleaching events trigger cumulative and interactive physiotypes driven by environmental legacy and cellular memory. Quantifying baseline and altered coral physiotypes (multivariate phenotype) will be critical to understanding and forecasting the effects of increased bleaching frequency on coral biology and ecology in the Anthropocene.","NA"

Using measures of phase-amplitude coupling, we show respiration-modulated brain oscillations (RMBOs) across all major frequency bands. Sources of these modulations spanned a widespread network of cortical and subcortical brain areas which formed clusters with distinct spectro-temporal modulation profiles. Globally, gamma modulation increased with distance to the head centre, whereas delta and theta modulation decreased with height in the sagittal plane. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive mapping of RMBOs across the entire brain, highlighting respiration-brain coupling as a fundamental mechanism to shape neural processing within canonical resting-state and respiratory control networks.","NA"

Activity in sternocleidomastoid (SCM) electromyogram is suggested to indicate activation of this pathway. We evaluated whether SCM activity can accurately identify trials which may differ in their neurophysiological triggering and assessed the use of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of reaction time (RT) data to identify trials with the shortest RTs for analysis. Using recent datasets from the StartReact literature, we examined the relationship between RT and SCM activity. We categorised data into short/longer RT bins using CDFs and used linear mixed effects models to compare potential conclusions that can be drawn when categorising data on the basis of RT versus on the basis of SCM activity. The capacity of SCM to predict RT is task-specific, making it an unreliable indicator of distinct neurophysiological mechanisms. Classification of trials using CDFs is capable of capturing potential task- or muscle-related differences in triggering whilst avoiding the pitfalls of the traditional SCM activity based classification method. We conclude that SCM activity is not always evident on trials that show the early triggering of movements seen in the StartReact phenomenon. We further propose that a more comprehensive analysis of data may be achieved through the inclusion of CDF analyses. These findings have implications for future research investigating movement triggering as well as for potential therapeutic applications of StartReact.","NA"

Early diagnosis and detection of the disease would allow for more effective crop management practices to prevent outbreaks in field or greenhouse settings. Furthermore, having a simple, non-invasive way to quantify the extent of gray mold disease is important for plant pathologists interested in quantifying infection rates. In this paper, we design and build a multispectral imaging system for discriminating between leaf regions, infected with gray mold, and those that remain unharmed on a lettuce (Lactuca spp.) host. First, we describe a method to select two optimal (high contrast) spectral bands from continuous hyperspectral imagery (450-800 nm). We then built a system based on these two spectral bands, located at 540 and 670 nm. The resultant system uses two cameras, with a narrow band-pass spectral filter mounted on each, to measure the multispectral reflectance of a lettuce leaf. The two resulting images are combined using a normalized difference calculation that produces a single image with high contrast between the leaves infected and healthy regions. A classifier was then created based on the thresholding of single pixel values. We demonstrate that this simple classification produces a true positive rate of 95.25% with a false positive rate of 9.316%.","NA"

Accurate identification of the m6A sites is fundamental to deeply understand the biological functions and mechanisms of the modification. However, the experimental methods for detecting m6A sites are usually time-consuming and expensive, and various computational methods have been developed to identify m6A sites in RNA. This paper proposes a novel cross-species computational method StackRAM using machine learning algorithms to identify the m6A sites in S. cerevisiaeH. sapiens and A. thaliana. First, the RNA sequences features are extracted through binary encoding, chemical property, nucleotide frequency, k-mer nucleotide frequency, pseudo dinucleotide composition, and position-specific trinucleotide propensity, and the initial feature set is obtained by feature fusion. Secondly, the Elastic Net is used for the first time to filter redundant and noisy information and retain important features for m6A sites classification. Finally, the base-classifiers output probabilities are combined with the optimal feature subset corresponding to the Elastic Net, and the combination feature input the second-stage meta-classifier SVM. The jackknife test on training dataset S. cerevisiae indicates that the prediction performance of StackRAM is superior to the current state-of-the-art methods. StackRAM prediction accuracy for independent test datasets H. sapiens and A. thaliana reach 92.30% and 87.06%, respectively. Therefore, StackRAM has development potential in cross-species prediction and can be a useful method for identifying m6A sites.

Two main factors that affect the statistical power of detecting eQTLs are: 1) relatively small size of samples available, and 2) heavy burden of multiple testing due to a very large number of variants to be tested. The later issue is particularly severe when one tries to identify trans-eQTLs that are far away from the genes they influence. If one can exploit co-expressed genes jointly in eQTL-mapping, effective sample size can be increased. Furthermore, using the structure of the gene regulatory network (GRN) may help to identify trans-eQTLs without increasing multiple testing burden.

ResultsIn this paper, we employ the structure equation model (SEM) to model both GRN and effect of eQTLs on gene expression, and then develop a novel algorithm, named sparse SEM, for eQTL mapping (SSEMQ) to conduct joint eQTL mapping and GRN inference. The SEM can exploit co-expressed genes jointly in eQTL mapping and also use GRN to determine trans-eQTLs. Computer simulations demonstrate that our SSEMQ significantly outperforms eight existing eQTL mapping methods. SSEMQ is further employed to analyze a real dataset of human breast tissues, yielding a number of cis- and trans-eQTLs.

A better understanding of the conditions and processes determining epidemic outbreaks caused by the emergence of a new pathogen, or pathogen strain, is needed to develop strategies and inform decisions to manage emerging diseases. A polyetic process-based model is developed to analyse conditions of disease emergence. This model simulates polycyclic epidemics during successive growing seasons, the yield losses they cause, and the pathogen survival between growing seasons. This framework considers an immigrant strain coming into a system where a resident strain is already established. Outcomes are formulated in terms of probability of emergence, time to emergence, and yield loss, resulting from deterministic and stochastic simulations. An analytical solution to determine a threshold for emergence is also derived. Analyses focus on the effects of two fitness parameters on emergence: the relative rate of reproduction (speed of epidemics), and the relative rate of mortality (decay of population between seasons). Analyses revealed that stochasticity is a critical feature of disease emergence. The simulations suggests that: (1) emergence may require a series of independent immigration events before a successful invasion takes place; (2) an explosion in the population size of the new pathogen (or strain) may be preceded by many successive growing seasons of cryptic presence following an immigration event, and; (3) survival between growing seasons is as important as reproduction during the growing season in determining disease emergence.","NA"

The identification of synergistic drug combinations, however, is challenging. Detailed understanding of antibiotic mechanisms can address this issue by facilitating the rational design of improved combination therapies. Here, using diverse biochemical and genetic assays, we reveal the molecular mechanisms of niclosamide, a clinically-approved salicylanilide compound, and demonstrate its potential for Gram-negative combination therapies. We discovered that Gram-negative bacteria possess two innate resistance mechanisms that reduce their niclosamide susceptibility: a primary mechanism mediated by multidrug efflux pumps and a secondary mechanism of nitroreduction. When efflux was compromised, niclosamide became a potent antibiotic, dissipating the proton motive force (PMF), increasing oxidative stress and reducing ATP production to cause cell death. These insights guided the identification of diverse compounds that synergized with salicylanilides when co-administered (efflux inhibitors, membrane permeabilizers, and antibiotics that are expelled by PMF-dependent efflux), thus suggesting that salicylanilide compounds may have broad utility in combination therapies. We validate these findings in vivo using a murine abscess model, where we show that niclosamide synergizes with the membrane permeabilizing antibiotic colistin against high-density infections of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates. We further demonstrate that enhanced nitroreductase activity is a potential route to adaptive niclosamide resistance but show that this causes collateral susceptibility to clinical nitro-prodrug antibiotics. Thus, we highlight how mechanistic understanding of mode of action, innate/adaptive resistance, and synergy can rationally guide the discovery, development and stewardship of novel combination therapies.

ImportanceThere is a critical need for more effective treatments to combat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. Combination therapies are a promising strategy, especially when these enable existing clinical drugs to be repurposed as antibiotics. We reveal the mechanisms of action and basis of innate Gram-negative resistance for the anthelmintic drug niclosamide, and subsequently exploit this information to demonstrate that niclosamide and analogs kill Gram-negative bacteria when combined with antibiotics that inhibit drug efflux or permeabilize membranes. We confirm the synergistic potential of niclosamide in vitro against a diverse range of recalcitrant Gram-negative clinical isolates, and in vivo in a mouse abscess model. We also demonstrate that nitroreductases can confer resistance to niclosamide, but show that evolution of these enzymes for enhanced niclosamide resistance confers a collateral sensitivity to other clinical antibiotics. Our results highlight how detailed mechanistic understanding can accelerate the evaluation and implementation of new combination therapies.","NA"

Calcium imaging indicates that olfactory sensory neurons innervating a lateral glomerulus detect the substance. Several telencephalic regions including the entopeduncular nucleus are also activated, with sustained activity outlasting stimulus delivery observable in the lateral habenula, posterior tuberculum, superior raphe, locus coeruleus, and periaqueductal gray. Consistent with the idea that these changes are related to an increased sensitivity to threats, larvae show increased dark avoidance after Schreckstoff removal.

Language provides a fertile testing ground for examining predictive mechanisms, as comprehenders use context to predict different features of upcoming words. Although there is a substantive body of research on prediction in language, many aspects of the mechanisms of prediction remain elusive, in part due to a lack of methodological tools to probe prediction formation in the moment. To elucidate what features are neurally pre-activated and when, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA) on data from a sentence reading task (Federmeier et al., 2007). We compared EEG activity patterns elicited by expected and unexpected sentence final words to patterns from the preceding words of the sentence, in both strongly and weakly constraining sentences. Pattern similarity with the final word was increased in an early time window (suggestive of visual feature activation) following the presentation of the pre-final word, and this increase was modulated by both expectancy and constraint (greatest for strongly constrained expected words). This was not seen at earlier words, suggesting that predictions are precisely timed. Additionally, pre-final word activity - the predicted representation - had negative similarity with later final word activity, but only for strongly expected words. Together, these findings shed light on the mechanisms of prediction in the brain: features of upcoming stimuli are rapidly pre-activated following related cues, but the predicted information may receive reduced subsequent processing upon confirmation.","NA"

Most exisiting methods are focused on individual cancer drivers which regulate biological processes leading to cancer. However, the effect of a single gene may not be sufficient to drive cancer progression. Here, we hypothesise that there are driver gene groups that work in concert to regulate cancer and we develop a novel computational method to detect those driver gene groups.

ResultsWe develop a novel method named DriverGroup to detect driver gene groups by using gene expression and gene interaction data. The proposed method has three stages: (1) Constructing the gene network, (2) Discovering critical nodes of the constructed network, and (3) Identifying driver gene groups based on the discovered critical nodes. Before evaluating the performance of DriverGroup in detecting cancer driver groups, we firstly assess its performance in detecting the influence of gene groups, a key step of DriverGroup. The application of DriverGroup to DREAM4 data demonstrates that it is more effective than other methods in detecting the regulation of gene groups. We then apply DriverGroup to the BRCA dataset to identify coding and non-coding driver groups for breast cancer. The identified driver groups are promising as several group members are confirmed to be related to cancer in literature. We further use the predicted driver groups in survival analysis and the results show that the survival curves of patient subpopulations classified using the predicted driver groups are significantly differentiated, indicating the usefulness of DriverGroup.

Of particular importance, egress and invasion of erythrocytes by the parasite are difficult to capture in an unsynchronized culture, or even a culture that has been synchronized to within hours. Therefore, precise synchronization of parasite cultures is of paramount importance for the investigation of these processes. Here we describe a method for synchronizing Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi asexual blood stage parasites with ML10, a highly specific inhibitor of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) that arrests parasite growth approximately 15 minutes prior to egress. This inhibitor allows parasite cultures to be synchronized to within minutes, with a simple wash step. Furthermore, we show that parasites remain viable for several hours after becoming arrested by the compound and that ML10 has advantages over the previously used PKG inhibitor Compound 2.

Yet, the majority (105 of 106) of the Ensifer strains with the nodABC and nifHDK nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes were found within a single, monophyletic clade. Comparative genomics highlighted several differences between the ""symbiotic"" and ""non-symbiotic"" clades, including divergences in their pangenome content. Additionally, strains of the symbiotic clade carried 325 fewer genes, on average, and appeared to have fewer rRNA operons than strains of the non-symbiotic clade.

Our key observation - that holds for both FitzHugh-Nagumo and Hodgkin-Huxley neuron models - is that for neuron models that do exhibit TI stimulation, a high frequency pure sinusoidal input results in a current balance between inward and outward currents. This current balance leads to a subthreshold periodic orbit that keeps the membrane potential from spiking for sinusoidal inputs. However, the balance is disturbed when the envelope of the sinusoids is modulated with a high slope: the fast-changing envelope activates fast depolarizing currents without giving slow outward currents time to respond. This imbalance causes the membrane potential to build up, causing the neuron to fire. This mechanistic understanding can help design current waveforms for neurons that exhibit TI stimulation.","NA"

The law is observed across the perception of weight, light intensity, and sound intensity and pitch. Two models of perception have been proposed to explain Webers law, namely the logarithmic and the linear model. This paper argues in favour of the linear model, which requires the sensory perception system to generate linear signal-response relationship over several orders of magnitude. To this end, a four-node motif is constructed from first principles which in series provides linear relationship between signal and response over arbitrary range of signal. The motif also reproduces the neuronal data of numerosity detection studies on monkeys. The series of this motif provides a general mechanism to sensitively detect signal over arbitrary range. The series also provides a general basis for a class of bow-tie architecture where the number of receptors is much lower than the range of signal and response. Besides numerosity processing, another example of this class of bow-tie architecture that the series of this motif is able to produce is absorption spectra of cone opsins of humans. Further, the series can also compute logarithm over arbitrary range of signal.","NA"

We present a novel deep-forest-based method for PPIs prediction. First, pseudo amino acid composition (PAAC), autocorrelation descriptor (Auto), multivariate mutual information (MMI), composition-transition-distribution (CTD), and amino acid composition PSSM (AAC-PSSM), and dipeptide composition PSSM (DPC-PSSM) are adopted to extract and construct the pattern of PPIs. Secondly, elastic net is utilized to optimize the initial feature vectors and boost the predictive performance. Finally, GcForest-PPI model based on deep forest is built up. Benchmark experiments reveal that the accuracy values of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Helicobacter pylori are 95.44% and 89.26%. We also apply GcForest-PPI on independent test sets and CD9-core network, crossover network, and cancer-specific network.

ResultsHere we present a stack of two C++ libraries, libbdsg and libhandlegraph, which use a simple, field-proven interface, designed to expose elementary features of these graphs while preventing common graph manipulation mistakes. The libraries also provide a Python binding. Using a diverse collection of pangenome graphs, we demonstrate that these tools allow for efficient construction and manipulation of large genome graphs with dense variation.

A robust fibro-inflammatory and desmoplastic stroma, characteristic of pancreatic cancer, contributes to the challenges in developing viable therapeutic strategies in this disease. Apart from constricting blood vessels and preventing efficient drug delivery to the tumor, the stroma also contributes to aggressive biology of the cancer along with its immune-evasive microenvironment. In this study, we show that in pancreatic tumors, the developing stroma increases tumor initiation frequency in pancreatic cancer cells in vivo by enriching for CD133+ aggressive ""stem-like"" cells. Additionally, the stromal fibroblasts secrete IL6 as the major cytokine, increases glycolytic flux in the pancreatic tumor cells and increases lactate efflux in the microenvironment via activation of the STAT signaling pathway. We also show that the secreted lactate favors activation of M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, which excludes CD8+ T-cells in the tumor. Our data additionally confirms that treatment of pancreatic tumors with anti-IL6 antibody results in tumor regression as well as decreased CD133+ population within the tumor. Furthermore, inhibiting the lactate efflux in the microenvironment reduces M2 macrophages, and makes pancreatic tumors more responsive to anti-PD1 therapy. This suggests that stromal IL6 driven metabolic reprogramming plays a significant role in the development of an immune evasive microenvironment. In conclusion, our study shows that targeting the metabolic pathways affected by stromal IL6 can make pancreatic tumors amenable to checkpoint inhibitor therapy.","NA"

Among all dinucleotides, we found that CpG is the most unevenly distributed and the distributions of all dinucleotides are correlated and organized in blocks in high species, suggesting their biological impact on regulation. By comparing the local density fluctuations and the hierarchical distribution of CpG at different scales of genomic lengths, we found that CpG distributions of different species have distinct characteristics.

We aimed to assess the reproducibility and network- and cognitive-specificity of these effects following multi-day rTMS. Participants received four days of 20 Hz rTMS to a subject-specific region of left lateral parietal cortex exhibiting peak functional connectivity to the left hippocampus. In a separate week, the same stimulation protocol was applied to a subject-specific region of pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) exhibiting peak functional connectivity to the left putamen.

Although computational methods have been developed to identify cancer drivers, most of them detect cancer drivers at population level. However, two patients who have the same cancer type and receive the same treatment may have different outcomes because each patient has a different genome and their disease might be driven by different driver genes. Therefore new methods are being developed for discovering cancer drivers at individual level, but existing personalised methods only focus on coding drivers while microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to drive cancer progression as well. Thus, novel methods are required to discover both coding and miRNA cancer drivers at individual level.

ResultsWe propose the novel method, pDriver, to discover personalised cancer drivers. pDriver includes two stages: (1) Constructing gene networks for each cancer patient and (2) Discovering cancer drivers for each patient based on the constructed gene networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of pDriver, we have applied it to five TCGA cancer datasets and compared it with the state-of-the-art methods. The result indicates that pDriver is more effective than other methods. Furthermore, pDriver can also detect miRNA cancer drivers and most of them have been confirmed to be associated with cancer by literature. We further analyse the predicted personalised drivers for breast cancer patients and the result shows that they are significantly enriched in many GO processes and KEGG pathways involved in breast cancer.

One of the main roles of ontologies is to provide structured background knowledge within a domain as well as a set of labels, synonyms, and definitions for the classes within a domain. The two types of information provided by ontologies have been extensively exploited in natural language processing and machine learning applications. However, they are commonly used separately, and thus it is unknown if joining the two sources of information can further benefit data analysis tasks.

ResultsWe developed a novel method that applies named entity recognition and normalization methods on texts to connect the structured information in biomedical ontologies with the information contained in natural language. We apply this normalization both to literature and to the natural language information contained within ontologies themselves. The normalized ontologies and text are then used to generate embeddings, and relations between entities are predicted using a deep Siamese neural network model that takes these embeddings as input. We demonstrate that our novel embedding and prediction method using self-normalized biomedical ontologies significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in embedding ontologies on two benchmark tasks: prediction of interactions between proteins and prediction of gene-disease associations. Our method also allows us to apply ontology-based annotations and axioms to the prediction of toxicological effects of chemicals where our method shows superior performance. Our method is generic and can be applied in scenarios where ontologies consisting of both structured information and natural language labels or synonyms are used.

COSMOS provides mechanistic hypotheses for experimental observations across multi-omics datasets.

ResultsWe present a novel pipeline (CamCNV) with a series of steps to reduce noise and detect more reliably rare CNVs covering as few as three probes. The method uses the information from all samples to convert intensities to z-scores, thus adjusting for variance between probes. We tested the sensitivity of our pipeline by looking for known CNVs from the 1000 Genomes project in our genotyping of 1000 Genomes samples. We also compared the CNV calls for 1,661 pairs of genotyped replicate samples. At the chosen mean z-score cut-off, sensitivity to detect the 1000 Genomes CNVs was approximately 85% for deletions and 65% for duplications. From the replicates we estimate the false discovery rate is controlled at [~]10% for deletions (falling to below 3% with more than five probes) and [~]28% for duplications. The pipeline demonstrates improved sensitivity when compared to calling with PennCNV, particularly for short deletions covering only a few probes

Many emerging technologies are attempting to convey complex spatiotemporal information via tactile percepts shown to be effective in the visual domain, such as shape and motion. Despite the intuitive appeal of touch as a method of feedback, we do not know to what extent the hand can substitute for the retina in this way. Here we ask whether the tactile system can be used to perceive complex whole hand motion stimuli, and whether it exhibits the same kind of established perceptual biases as reported in the visual domain. Using ultrasound stimulation, we were able to project complex moving dot percepts onto the palm in mid-air, over 30cm above an emitter device. We generated dot kinetogram stimuli involving motion in three different directional axes ( Horizontal,  Vertical, and  Oblique) on the ventral surface of the hand. We found clear evidence that participants were able to discriminate tactile motion direction. Furthermore, there was a marked directional bias in motion perception: participants were better and more confident at discriminating motion in the vertical and horizontal axes of the hand, compared to those stimuli moving obliquely. This pattern directly mirrors the perceptional biases that have been robustly reported in the visual field, termed the  Oblique Effect. These data show the existence of biases in motion perception that transcend sensory modality. Furthermore, we extend the Oblique Effect to a whole hand scale, using motion stimuli presented on the broad and relatively low acuity surface of the palm, away from the densely innervated and much studied fingertips. These findings also highlight targeted ultrasound stimulation as a versatile means by which to convey potentially complex spatial and temporal information without the need for a user to wear or touch a device. This ability is particularly attractive as a potential feedback mechanism for application in contact-free human machine interfaces.","NA"

Understanding these interactions is crucial for studying the mechanisms in cell differentiation, growth and development. Computational methods are needed to infer these networks from measured data. Although the availability of single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data provides unprecedented scale and resolution of gene-expression data, the inference of GRNs remains a challenge, mainly due to the complexity of the regulatory relationships and the noise in the data.

ResultsWe propose GRNUlar, a novel deep learning architecture based on the unrolled algorithms idea for GRN inference from scRNA-Seq data. Like some existing methods which use prior information of which genes are TFs, GRNUlar also incorporates this TF information using a sparse multi-task deep learning architecture. We also demonstrate the application of a recently developed unrolled architecture GLAD to recover undirected GRNs in the absence of TF information. These unrolled architectures require supervision to train, for which we leverage the existing synthetic data simulators which generate scRNA-Seq data guided by a GRN. We show that unrolled algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods on synthetic data as well as real datasets in both the settings of TF information being absent or available.

Further analysis reveals a refinement of neuron differentiation that occurred in human but not in mouse, suggesting that excitatory neurons in human undergo refined transcriptional states in later development stage. By contrast, for glial cells and inhibitory neurons we detected conserved developmental trajectories in human and mouse.

ConclusionsTaken together, our study integrates scRNA-seq data of cerebral cortex development in human and mouse, and uncovers distinct developing models in neocortical projection neurons. The earlier activation of cognition -related genes in human may explain the differences in behavior, learning or memory abilities between the two species.","NA"

Here we use field data collected across 15 lowland Amazon smallholder properties to examine the relationships between forest structure, mammal diversity, regrowth type, regrowth age, topography and hydrography. Forest structure was quantified together with mammal diversity in 30 paired regrowth-control plots. Forest regrowth stage was classified into three groups: late second-regrowth, early second-regrowth and abandoned pasture. Basal area in regrowth plots remained less than half that recorded in control plots even after 20-25 years. Although basal area did increase in sequence from pasture, early to late-regrowth plots, there was a significant decline in basal area of late-regrowth control plots associated with a decline in the proportion of large trees. There was also contrasting support for different non-mutually exclusive hypotheses, with proportion of small trees (DBH <20cm) most strongly supported by topography (altitude and slope) whereas the proportion of large trees (DBH >60cm) supported by plot type and regrowth class. These findings support calls for increased efforts to actively conserve large trees to avoid retrogressive succession around edges of degraded Amazon forests.","NA"

Here, we addressed the effects of simvastatin (SIM), one of the most prescribed human pharmaceuticals, in epigenetic regulators of the amphipod Gammarus locusta, as a proxy to support its integration in hazard and environmental risk assessment. SIM is a known modulator of epigenome in mammalian cell lines, and has been reported to impact G. locusta ecological endpoints at environmentally relevant levels. G. locusta juveniles were exposed to three SIM concentrations (0.32, 1.6 and 8 {micro}g.L-1), for 15 days. The basal expression of selected epigenetic regulators was determined, along with the quantification of DNA methylation levels and the assessment of key ecological endpoints. Exposure to 0.32 and 8 {micro}g.L-1 SIM induced significant downregulation of DNA methyltransferase1 (dnmt1), concomitantly with Global DNA hypomethylation and impact on growth.

In the field of tissue engineering, WJ-MSCs have a wide therapeutic potential, due to their multipotential capacity, which can be reinforced if cells are genetically modified to direct their differentiation towards a specific lineage; unfortunately, as primary cells, WJ-MSC are difficult to transfect. Therefore, the objective of the present work was to standardize a protocol for the transfection of WJ-MSCs using a cationic polymer. Such protocol is important for future developments that contemplate the genetic modification of WJ-MSCs for therapeutic purposes.

MethodsIn this work, WJ-MSCs were genetically modified using polyethylenimine (PEI) and a lentiviral plasmid that encodes for green fluorescent protein (pGFP). To achieve WJ-MSCs transfection, complexes between PEI and pGFP, varying its composition (N/P ratio), were evaluated and characterized by size, zeta potential and cytotoxicity. At the N/P ratio condition where the highest transfection efficiencies were obtained, immunophenotype, immunomodulation properties and multipotential capacity of WJ-MSCs were evaluated.

ResultsHere, we present the standardization of the transfection conditions of the WJ-MSCs in a monolayer culture with PEI. The concentrations of plasmid and PEI that have the best transfection efficiencies were established

InsP6 is also the precursor of higher phosphorylated forms called inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs), such as InsP7 and InsP8, which are characterized by a diphosphate moiety and are also ubiquitously found in eukaryotic cells. While PP-InsPs regulate various cellular processes in animals and yeast, their biosynthesis and functions in plants has remained largely elusive because plant genomes do not encode canonical InsP6 kinases. Recently, it was shown that Arabidopsis ITPK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of InsP6 to the natural 5-InsP7 isomer in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 contributes to the synthesis of InsP7 in planta. We further find a critical role of ITPK1 in auxin-related processes including primary root elongation, leaf venation, thermomorphogenic and gravitropic responses, and sensitivity towards exogenously applied auxin. Notably, 5-InsP7 binds to recombinant auxin receptor complex, consisting of the F-Box protein TIR1, ASK1 and the transcriptional repressor IAA7, with high affinity. Furthermore, a specific increase in 5-InsP7 in a heterologous yeast expression system results in elevated interaction of the TIR1 homologs AFB1 and AFB2 with various AUX/IAA-type transcriptional repressors. We also identified a physical interaction between ITPK1 and TIR1, suggesting a dedicated channeling of an activating factor, such as 5-InsP7, to the auxin receptor complex.

The multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF) provides a defence mechanism for bacteria against a broad range of AMPs. MprF reduces the negative charge of both Gram-positive and Gram--negative bacterial membranes through enzymatic conversion of the anionic lipid phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) to either zwitterionic alanyl-phosphatidyl glycerol (Ala-PG) or cationic lysylphosphatidyl glycerol (Lys-PG). The resulting change in membrane charge is suggested to reduce AMP-membrane binding and hinder downstream AMP activity. Using molecular dynamics to investigate the effects of these modified lipids on AMP-binding to model membranes, we show that AMPs have substantially reduced affinity for model membranes containing Ala-PG or Lys-PG. A total of ~7000 simulations are used to define the relationship between bilayer composition and binding for 5 different membrane active peptides. The reduction of degree of interaction of a peptide with the membrane is shown to correlate with the change in membrane surface charge density. Free energy profile (potential of mean force) calculations reveal that these lipid modifications alter the energy barrier to peptide helix penetration of the bilayer. These results will enable us to guide design of novel peptides which address the issue of resistance via MprF-mediated membrane modification.","NA"

Here, we develop a computational approach to implement Hi-C, GAM and SPRITE in-silico to compare the three methods in a simplified, yet controlled framework against known polymer 3D structures. We test our approach on models of three 6-Mb genomic regions, around the Sox9 and the HoxD genes in mouse ES cells, and around the Epha4 gene in mouse CHLX-12 cells. The model-derived contact matrices consistently match Hi-C, GAM and SPRITE experiments. We show that in-silico Hi-C, GAM and SPRITE average data are overall faithful to the 3D structures of the polymer models. We find that the inherent variability of model single-molecule 3D conformations and experimental efficiency differently affect the contact data of the different methods. Similarly, the noise-to-signal levels vary with genomic distance differently in in-silico Hi-C, SPRITE and GAM. We benchmark the performance of each technology in bulk and in single-cell experiments, and identify the minimal number of cells required for replicates to return statistically consistent chromatin contact measures. Under the same experimental conditions, SPRITE requires the lowest number of cells, Hi-C is close to SPRITE, while GAM is the most reproducible method to capture interactions at large genomic distances.","NA"

The indispensable regulator of RP biosynthesis is the 5-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif, spanning the transcription start site of all RP genes. Here we show that the Microprocessor complex, previously linked to the first step of processing microRNAs (miRNAs), coregulates RP expression by binding the TOP motif of nascent RP mRNAs and stimulating transcription elongation via resolution of DNA/RNA hybrids. Cell growth arrest triggers nuclear export and degradation of the Microprocessor protein Drosha by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, accumulation of DNA/RNA hybrids at RP gene loci, decreased RP synthesis, and ribosome deficiency, hence synchronizing ribosome production with cell growth. Conditional deletion of Drosha in erythroid progenitors phenocopies human ribosomopathies, in which ribosomal insufficiency leads to anemia. Outlining a miRNA-independent role of the Microprocessor complex at the interphase between cell growth and ribosome biogenesis offers a new paradigm by which cells alter their protein biosynthetic capacity and cellular metabolism.","NA"

Although many methods have been proposed for taxonomic classification, to the best of our knowledge, none of them consider the taxonomic tree hierarchy when building their models. This in turn, leads to lower generalization power and higher risk of committing classification errors.

Current state-of-the-art approaches solve this design problem sequentially. Consequently, such approaches are unable to capture the inter-dependencies between the two design steps, usually emphasizing theoretical immunogenicity over correct vaccine processing and resulting in vaccines with less effective immunogencity.

We demonstrate that the histone core exerts important mechanical restraints that largely decrease global DNA structural fluctuations. However, we also show that local DNA flexibility at the damaged site is enhanced, due to imperfect structural adaptation to restraints imposed by the histone core. In particular, if 64-PP faces the histone core and is therefore not directly accessible by the repair protein, the complementary strand facing the solvent exhibits higher flexibility than the corresponding strand in a naked, undamaged DNA. This may serve as an initial recognition signal for repair. Our simulations also pinpoint the structural role of proximal residues from the truncated histone tails.","NA"

A sentinel system assumes that sentinels are located at raised positions, alarm signal, and alternate vigilance bouts. However, many species with a described sentinel system have not been tested yet for coordination. We set out to study coordinated behavior and the reasons for this behavior in the invasive Barbary ground squirrel, Atlantoxerus getulus, using behavioral observations and genetic analyses. This species performs a type of vigilance ( perch behavior) seemingly similar to sentinel behavior as individuals performed high-quality vigilance at raised locations for over 30 s, but alternating coordination is unknown. Perch behavior was coordinated but synchronized instead of taking turns (sentinel). Both sexes performed perch behavior and individuals performed perch behavior in the absence and presence of kin and offspring. We found that survival or time spent foraging did not decrease for perched individuals, nor that individual survival increased. Perch behavior in the invasive population of A. getulus may be synchronized 1) to perform an optimal activity when satiated (low costs), and, 2) may be an adaptation to habitat structure (large benefits).

We evaluated osmotic and ionic regulatory ability in the semi-terrestrial mangrove crab Ucides cordatus after 10-days acclimation to different salinities. We also analyzed modulation by exogenous FXYD2 peptide and by endogenous protein kinases A and C, and Ca2+- calmodulin-dependent kinase of (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity. Hemolymph osmolality was strongly hyper-/hypo-regulated in crabs acclimated at 2 to 35 {per thousand}S. Cl- was well hyper-/hypo- regulated although Na+ much less so, becoming iso-natremic at high salinity. (Na+, K+)- ATPase activity was greatest in isosmotic crabs (26 {per thousand}S), diminishing progressively from 18 and 8 {per thousand}S ({approx}0.5 fold) to 2 {per thousand}S (0.04-fold), and decreasing notably at 35 {per thousand}S (0.07-fold). At low salinity, the (Na+, K+)-ATPase exhibited a low affinity ATP-binding site that showed Michaelis-Menten behavior. Above 18 {per thousand}S, an additional, high affinity ATP-binding site, corresponding to 10-20% of total (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity appeared. Activity is stimulated by exogenous pig kidney FXYD2 peptide, while endogenous protein kinases A and C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase all inhibit activity. This is the first demonstration of inhibitory phosphorylation of a crustacean (Na+, K+)-ATPase by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase. Curiously, hyper-osmoregulation in U. cordatus shows little dependence on gill (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity, suggesting a role for other ion transporters. These findings reveal that the salinity acclimation response in U. cordatus consists of a suite of osmoregulatory and enzymatic adjustments that maintain its osmotic homeostasis in a challenging, mangrove forest environment.

Overwinter microbial activity has important effects on global carbon (C) budgets2, nutrient cycling and vegetation community composition3. Microbial respiration is highly temperature sensitive in frozen soils, as liquid water and solute availability decrease rapidly with declining temperature4. Thus, temperature is considered the ultimate control on overwinter soil microbial activity in the Arctic. Warmer winter soils are thought to yield greater microbial respiration of available C, greater overwinter CO2 efflux and a flush of nutrients that could be available for plant uptake at thaw3. Rising air temperature, combined with changes in timing and/or depth of snowpack development, is leading to warmer Arctic winter soils5. Using observational and experimental approaches in the field and in the laboratory, we demonstrate that persistently warm winter soils can lead to labile C starvation of the microbial community and reduced respiration rates, despite the high C content of most arctic soils. If Arctic winter soil temperatures continue to rise, microbial C limitation will reduce cold season CO2 emissions and alter soil nutrient cycling, if not countered by greater labile C inputs.","NA"

Lately, this traditional method is declining due to modernization, its unhygienic conditions and social apprehensions. Reduction in the age-old traditional practice has led to excessive usage of chemical fertilizers and shortage of water in the eco-sensitive region. Microbiological intervention was attempted to obtain bacterial consortia for accelerated degradation of human faeces in cold climate to improvise this traditional knowledge. Glutamicibacter arilaitensis LJH19, a psychrotrophic bacteria was identified as one such potential candidate for the proposed consortia. The bacterium was isolated from NSC of Lahaul valley and exhibited potential hydrolytic activities, the specific activities of amylase, cellulase and xylanase was observed as 186.76 U/mg, 21.85 U/mg and 11.31 U/mg respectively. Additionally, the strain possessed multiple plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits. The bacterium produced 166.11 {micro}g/ml indole acetic acid and 85.72 % siderophore units, and solubilized 44.76 {micro}g/ml phosphate. Whole genome sequence (3,602,821 bps) endorsed the cold adaptation, polysaccharide metabolism, PGP potential of the bacterium. Genome mining revealed biosynthetic gene clusters for type III polyketide synthase (PKS), terpene, and siderophore in agreement with its potential PGP traits. Comparative genomics within the genus revealed 217 unique genes specific to hydrolytic and PGP activity. Negative haemolysis and biofilm production and susceptibility towards all 12 tested antibiotics indicated the bacterium to be a safe bioinoculant. Genomic investigation supported the bacterium safety with absence of any virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. We propose the strain LJH19 to be a potentially safe bioinoculant candidate for efficient degradation of night soil owing to its survivability in cold and its efficient hydrolytic and PGP potential.","NA"

Anatomical and electrophysiological analyses show PV input to L2/3, but not L5, pyramidal (Pyr) neurons is rapidly suppressed during early stages of sensory training, effects that are reversed after longer training periods. Importantly, sensory stimulation without reward does not alter PV-mediated inhibition. Computational modeling indicates that reduced PV inhibition in L2/3 selectively enables an increase in translaminar recurrent activity, also observed during SAT. PV disinhibition in superficial layers of the neocortex may be one of the earliest changes in learning-dependent rewiring of the cortical column.

Leukocytes synthesize the endogenous opioid, {beta}-endorphin ({beta}-END), within their endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When released into plasma, {beta}-END dampens nociceptive transmission by binding to opioid receptors on sensory neurons. In the present study, we hypothesized that heme-induced ER stress attenuates leukocyte levels/release of {beta}-END, thereby increasing pain sensitivity in PWH. Results demonstrate that PWH with CWP have fragile erythrocytes, high plasma levels of cell-free heme, and impaired heme metabolism. Leukocytes from PWH with CWP also had high ER stress and low {beta}-END compared to PWH without CWP and HIV-negative individuals with or without pain. In vitro heme exposure decreased {beta}-END levels/secretion in murine monocytes/macrophages, which was prevented by treatment with sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, an ER stress inhibitor. To mimic hemolytic effects in a preclinical model in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were injected with phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (PHZ). PHZ increased cell-free heme and ER stress, decreased leukocyte {beta}-END levels and hindpaw mechanical sensitivity thresholds. Treatment of PHZ-injected mice with the heme scavenger, hemopexin, blocked these effects, suggesting that heme-induced ER stress and a subsequent decrease in leukocyte {beta}-END may contribute to CWP in PWH.","NA"

Heterotropa (genus Asarum; Aristolochiaceae) diverges here and shows high species diversity in insular systems (63 species) compared to continental areas (25 species). Heterotropa shows low dispersal ability with small distribution ranges, implying diversification by geographic events, and high floral diversity, implying pollinator-mediated diversification. To reveal how abiotic and biotic factors have shaped the diversity anomaly of Heterotropa, we conducted phylogenetic analysis using ddRAD-seq and chloroplast genome datasets including 79 species, estimation of floral trait evolution, and comparison of isolation factors within clades based on distribution range and floral trait analysis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Heterotropa originated in mainland China and expanded to the Japanese Archipelago in the Miocene, and the major clades almost correspond to geographic distributions. Floral traits evolved repeatedly in the tip nodes within the clades. Although the major clades include a high proportion of species pairs showing isolation by floral traits, there are no conditional relationships between two isolation factors, indicating that most species pairs with floral trait isolation are distributed allopatrically. The repeated exposure and submergence of land-bridges caused by climatic oscillations would have led to significant population fragmentation in insular systems. Thus, the diversity anomaly of Heterotropa would have resulted from geographic and climatic events during the Miocene, while subsequent repeated floral trait evolution would have followed geographic isolation during the Pleistocene.","NA"

Fishing Cats (Prionailurus viverrinus) persistence in the  semi-aquatic niche (Kitchener et al. 2010) despite felids being terrestrial carnivores in general (>95%) (Hunter 2019) suggests the evolution of a successful hunting strategy. Its further suggest selection for hunting in wetlands. What energy conserving strategies did the Fishing Cat borrow from its family and how were these adapted to optimize energy gained from hunting fish, its primary prey? We attempt to answer this by analyzing 197 video footages collected opportunistically from a participatory science initiative conducted over 2.5 years. We found that the felid switches between stationary and active modes of searching for prey depending on the depth of water and the corresponding loss of body heat/energy. For example, diving in deeper waters requires the submergence of the upper portions of the body and loss of more body heat/energy. Our analysis shows that the cat spent much of its time (~52%) sitting and waiting for prey (fish) to come nearer and then took limited attempts to dive into deeper water (2.78%). We suggest that this is a strategy to optimize the net energy gain. In shallow waters where the cat could forage without submerging the upper body it adopted a predominantly active mode of hunting (~96%) to flush out prey. Thus, prominent hunting strategies in the small cat lineage like  sit-and-wait and  active foraging is adapted to hunt in the water. We recorded a 60% hunting success in deeper waters but did not detect a successful hunt in shallow waters due to the low sample size of data from shallow water hunting. The major caveat in our study is the post-hoc analysis of opportunistically collected data as opposed to data derived from a structured design with predefined objectives. With more sampling from various seasons and landscapes, finer details can be explored which would have conservation implications. For example, we would expect variations in  attempts to hunt during cold seasons because heat loss might be less of a challenge in the latter. Quantifying  attempts to hunt and  successful hunts across seasons could help focus management interventions to minimize negative interactions between fish cultivators and Fishing Cat. The strictly nocturnal activity of fishing cat as demonstrated in our study could be a strategy taken by the cat to avoid humans. Our approach of using participatory-science is relevant for conducting research on mammal behavior in human dominated landscapes.","NA"

The amount of spectral space occupied by individuals and plant communities increased with plant growth and community productivity, respectively. Further, community productivity was better explained by inter-individual spectral complementarity than by productive individuals occupying large spectral niches.
C_LIO_LIThe degree of differentiation in spectral space provides the conceptual basis for identifying plant taxa spectrally. Moreover, our results indicate that the size and position of plant spectral niches reflect ecological strategies that shape community composition and ecosystem function, with the potential to reveal insight in niche partitioning over large areas with spectroscopy.

However, little is known about the precise molecular circuitry of NPY-mediated behaviors and physiological processes, which likely involve a complex interaction of multiple signal molecules in specific brain regions. Here we examined the expression of NPY throughout the Octopus central nervous system. The sequence analysis of Octopus NPY precursor confirmed the presence of both signal peptide and putative active peptides, which are highly conserved across bilaterians. In situ hybridization revealed distinct expression of NPY in specialized compartments, including potential ""integration centers,"" where visual, tactile, and other behavioral circuitries converge. These centers integrating separate circuits may maintain and modulate learning and memory or other behaviors not yet attributed to NPY-dependent modulation in Octopus. Extrasomatic localization of NPY mRNA in the neurites of specific neuron populations in the brain suggests a potential demand for immediate translation at synapses and a crucial temporal role for NPY in these cell populations. We also verified the presence of NPY mRNA in a small cell population in the olfactory lobe, which is a component of the Octopus feeding and reproductive control centers. However, the molecular mapping of NPY expression only partially overlapped with that produced by immunohistochemistry in previous studies. Our study provides a precise molecular map of NPY mRNA expression that can be used to design and test future hypotheses about molecular signaling in various Octopus behaviors.

Research Highlights/Graphical Abstract textNeuropeptide Y (NPY), an evolutionarily conserved neurosecretory molecule, is expressed in specialized regions of the Octopus brain controlling feeding, reproduction, and visual and tactile memory circuits. Extrasomatic mRNAs were found in neurites, suggesting synaptic synthesis of NPY.

The maintenance of a healthy cardiovascular system requires expression of genes that contribute to essential biological activities and repression of those that are associated with functions likely to be detrimental to cardiovascular homeostasis. In this study we have used the transcriptome of the sheep, which has been utilised extensively to model human physiology and disease, to explore genes implicated in the process of vascular calcification. Vascular calcification is a major disruption to cardiovascular homeostasis where tissues of the cardiovascular system undergo ectopic calcification and consequent dysfunction. We investigate the gene expression profiles of genes involved in vascular calcification in a wide array of cardiovascular tissues and across multiple developmental stages, using RT-qPCR. The majority of transcriptomic studies on the mammalian cardiovascular system to date have focused on regional expression of specific genes. Here we also use RNA sequencing results from the sheep heart and cardiac valves to further explore the transcriptome of the cardiovascular system in this large animal. Our results demonstrate that there is a balance between genes that promote and those that suppress mineralisation during development and across cardiovascular tissues. We show extensive expression of genes encoding proteins involved in formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix in cardiovascular tissues, and high expression of haematopoietic genes in the cardiac valves. Our analysis will support future research into the functions of implicated genes in the development of vascular calcification, and increase the utility of the sheep as a large animal model for understanding cardiovascular disease. This study provides a foundation to explore the transcriptome of the developing cardiovascular system and is a valuable resource for the fields of mammalian genomics and cardiovascular research.","NA"

Here, we generated a highly complete genome assembly of P. nigronervosa using a single PCR-free Illumina sequencing library. Using the same sequence data, we also generated complete genome assemblies of the P. nigronervosa symbiotic bacteria Buchnera aphidicola and Wolbachia. To improve our initial assembly of P. nigronervos a we developed a k-mer based deduplication pipeline to remove genomic scaffolds derived from the assembly of haplotigs (allelic variants assembled as separate scaffolds). To demonstrate the usefulness of this pipeline, we applied it to the recently generated assembly of the aphid Myzus cerasi, reducing the duplication of conserved BUSCO genes by 25%. Phylogenomic analysis of P. nigronervos a, our improved M. cerasi assembly, and seven previously published aphid genomes, spanning three aphid tribes and two subfamilies, reveals that P. nigronervos a falls within the tribe Macrosiphini, but is an outgroup to other Macrosiphini sequenced so far. As such, the genomic resources reported here will be useful for understanding both the evolution of Macrosphini and for the study of P. nigronervosa.

Surface motility is essential for exploring these habitats for food sources. However, many bacteria are found on surfaces, even though they lack features required for migrating along surfaces. How these canonical non-motile bacteria adapt to the environmental fluctuations on surfaces remains unknown. Recently, several cases of interspecies interaction were reported that induce surface motility of non-motile bacteria either by using  hitchhiking strategies or through  social spreading mechanisms. Here, we report a previously unknown mechanism for interaction-dependent surface motility of the canonical non-motile bacterium, Dietzia sp. DQ12-45-1b, which is induced by interaction with a dimorphic prosthecate bacterium, Glycocaulis alkaliphilus 6B-8T. Dietzia cells exhibits ""sliding""-like motility in an area where the strain Glycocaulis cells was pre-colonized with a sufficient density. Furthermore, we show that biosurfactants play a critical role in inducing the surface motility of Dietzia cells. Our analysis also demonstrates that Dietzia degrade n-alkanes and provide Glycocaulis with the resulting metabolites for survival, which in turn enabled directional migration of Dietzia towards nutrients in the environment. Such interaction-dependent migration was also found between Dietzia and Glycocaulis strains isolated from other habitats, suggesting that this mutualistic relationship ubiquitously occurs in natural environments. In conclusion, we propose a novel model for such a  win-win strategy, whereby non-motile bacteria pay metabolites to dimorphic prosthecate bacteria in return for migrating to reach environments otherwise inaccessible. We propose that this mechanism represents a common strategy for canonically non-motile bacteria living on a surface.

ImportanceCell motility provides a selective advantage for bacteria searching for nutrients. While a large body of evidence exists for how motile bacteria migrate on surface by virtue of different ways of motility, fewer studies concerned about how canonical non-motile bacteria adapted to those surface-associated habitats. Recent reports have proposed that interactions with other bacteria trigger the movement of those sessile bacteria. However, these interactions are limited to  hitchhiking or  social spreading modes. Here, we characterized a previously unknown interaction mode between Dietzia and Glycocaulis.

This interaction differs from previously described modes, thus advance our limited understanding of how sessile bacteria move on surfaces. We propose that this interaction mode represents a  win-win strategy for both strains, and this mode might be widely distributed across diverse environments. These novel insights should greatly assist in understanding the mechanisms responsible for the cellular interplay between microbes in complex microbiomes.","NA"

In this study, based on homology-detection screening on 305 Legionella effector proteins, we identified two Legionella OTU-like deubiquitinases (LOT; LotB (Lpg1621/Ceg23) and LotC (Lpg2529), LotA (Lpg2248/Lem21) is already known). A crystal structure of LotC catalytic core (LotC14-310) was determined at 2.4 [A] and compared with other OTU deubiquitinases, including LotB. Unlike the classical OTU-family, the structures of Legionella OTU-family (LotB and LotC) shows an extended helical lobe between the Cys-loop and the variable loop, which define a novel class of OTU-deubiquitinase. Despite structural differences in their helical lobes, both LotB and LotC interact with ubiquitin. LotB has an additional ubiquitin binding site (S1) enabling specific cleavage of Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. By contrast, LotC only contains the S1 site and cleaves different species of ubiquitin chains. MS analysis of catalytically inactive LotB and LotC identified different categories of host-substrates for these two related DUBs.

While pharmacological treatments for these disorders are ineffective for many individuals, physical activity is beneficial for stress-related symptoms. Galanin is highly expressed in the noradrenergic system, particularly the locus coeruleus (LC), which is dysregulated in stress-related disorders and activated by exercise. Galanin expression is elevated in the LC by chronic exercise, and blockade of galanin transmission attenuates exercise-induced stress resilience. However, most research on this topic has been done in rats, so it is unclear whether the relationship between exercise and galanin is species-specific. Moreover, use of intracerebroventricular galanin receptor antagonists in prior studies precluded defining a causal role for LC-derived galanin specifically. Therefore, the goals of this study were twofold. First, we investigated whether physical activity (chronic voluntary wheel running) increases stress resilience and galanin expression in the LC of mice. Next, we used transgenic mice that overexpress galanin in noradrenergic neurons (Gal OX) to determine how chronically elevated noradrenergic-derived galanin, alone, alters anxiogenic-like responses to stress. We found that three weeks of ad libitum access to a running wheel in their home cage increased galanin mRNA in the LC of mice and conferred resilience to a stressor. The effects of exercise were phenocopied by galanin overexpression in noradrenergic neurons, and Gal OX mice were resistant to the anxiogenic effect of optogenetic LC activation. Together, these findings support a role for chronically increased noradrenergic galanin in mediating resilience to stress.

Significance statementUnderstanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying behavioral responses to stress is necessary to improve treatments for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Increased physical activity is associated with stress resilience in humans, but the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this effect are not clear. Here we investigate the anxiolytic potential of the neuropeptide galanin from the main noradrenergic nucleus, the locus coeruleus (LC). We show that chronic voluntary wheel running in mice galanin expression in the LC and stress resilience. Furthermore, we show that genetic overexpression of galanin in noradrenergic neurons confers resilience to the anxiogenic effects of foot shock and optogenetic LC activation. These findings support a role for chronically increased noradrenergic galanin in mediating resilience to stress.","NA"

Our results highlight the decelerative phase of reach as important in driving successful outcome. Late-phase kinematic adjustments are yoked to mid-flight position and velocity of the limb, allowing dynamic correction of initial variability, with head-fixed reaches being less dependent on position.

However, when direct experience is unavailable, animals and humans can imagine or infer the future to make choices. Outcome expectations that are based on direct experience and inference may compete for guiding behavior [1, 2], and they may recruit distinct but overlapping brain circuits [3-5]. In rodents, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contains neural signatures of inferred outcomes and is necessary for behavior that requires inference, but it is not necessary when responding can be based on direct experience [6-10]. In humans, OFC activity is also correlated with inferred outcome expectations [11, 12], but it is unclear whether the human OFC is selectively required for inference-based behavior. To test this, here we used non-invasive targeted continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) [13] to inactivate the human OFC in a sensory preconditioning task designed to isolate inference-based behavior from responding that can be based on direct experience [6, 12, 14]. We show that OFC-targeted cTBS disrupts reward-related behavior only in conditions in which outcome expectations have to be mentally inferred, but that it does not impair behavior that can be based on stimulus-outcome associations that were directly experienced. These findings suggest that OFC is necessary for decision making when outcomes have to be mentally simulated, providing converging cross-species evidence for a critical role of OFC in model-based but not model-free behavior.","NA"

To aid interpretation of a given neural phenotype, gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) has become a standard statistical methodology to identify functionally related groups of genes, annotated using systems such as the Gene Ontology (GO), that are associated with a given phenotype. While GSEA has identified functional groups of genes related to diverse aspects of brain structure and function in mouse and human, here we show that these results are affected by substantial statistical biases. Quantifying the false-positive rates of individual GO categories across an ensemble of completely random phenotypic spatial maps, we found an average 875-fold inflation of significant findings relative to expectation in mouse, and a 582-fold inflation in human, with some categories being judged as significant for over 20% of random phenotypes. Concerningly, the probability of a GO category being reported as significant in the extant literature increases with its estimated false-positive rate, suggesting that published reports are strongly affected by the reporting of false-positive bias. We show that the bias is primarily driven by gene-gene coexpression and spatial autocorrelation in transcriptional data, which are not accounted for in conventional GSEA nulls, and we introduce flexible ensemble-based null models that properly account for these effects. Using case studies of structural connectivity degree in mouse and human, we demonstrate that many GO categories that would conventionally be judged as highly significant are in fact consistent with ensembles of random phenotypes. Our results highlight major pitfalls with applying standard GSEA to brain-wide transcriptomic data and outline a solution to this pervasive problem, which is made available as a toolbox.","NA"

To explore the role of cadherins in the etiology of autism, we investigated their expression patterns during mouse brain development and analyzed their functions using Cdh11 knockout mice. Expression of cadherin-8 and cadherin-11 was developmentally regulated and enriched in cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus/striatum during the peak of dendrite formation and synaptogenesis.

As meninges are an important tissue involved in the origin of migraine pain, we hypothesized that malfunctioning of a  cleaning lymphatic system should affect the functional properties of meningeal nociception. To test this hypothesis, we studied migraine-related nociceptive and inflammatory mechanisms in the meninges, in a mouse model of primary lymphedema (K14-VEGFR3-Ig mice) characterized by the lack of functional meningeal lymphatic system.

MethodsTo study the migraine-related nociceptive and inflammatory mechanisms we recorded spiking activity from meningeal fibers of the trigeminal nerve, estimated the local mast cells infiltration, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and cytokine levels (basal and under stimulating conditions), as well as the dura mater innervation in freshly-isolated hemiskull preparations from K14-VEGFR3-Ig (K14) or wild type C57BL/6 mice (WT).

ResultsWe found that the level of CGRP and the production of TNF, which both are implicated in migraine, were reduced in meninges of K14 mice. There was a trend of having a larger number of dural mast cells, consistent with the increased level of the mast cell activator MCP-1 found in these animals. In addition, we found an increased spontaneous and ATP-induced nociceptive firing in the meningeal afferents of mice lacking meningeal lymphatic system. However, the patterns of trigeminal innervation in meninges remained unchanged.

ConclusionsIn summary, the lack of meningeal lymphatic system leads to a new balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms implicated in peripheral nociception, affecting key cellular and humoral factors implicated in migraine.","NA"

An assumption underlying the compatibility is that plants are inert in mounting a defense response to non-pathogenic microbial factors. However, the mechanisms underlying this inertness in defense are unknown. Here a forward genetic screen led to the isolation of an Arabidopsis mutant displaying a new type of immunity which we named as latent defense response (LDR) to a beneficial rhizobacterium. The mutant, known as gp1 for Growth-Promotion 1, is impaired in rhizobacteria-induced plant growth-promotion due to disrupted oleic acid homeostasis and consequent activation of defense responses. Several bacterial volatile compounds trigger LDR in gp1 but not wild type plants. GP1 dysfunction strongly represses colonization of the beneficial rhizobacterium and alters root-associated microbiota. Our findings reveal a hidden layer of plant defense, LDR, which is suppressed by GP1 to allow mutualistic association between plants and beneficial rhizobacteria.

Wild and captive horseshoe crabs (5 months captivity) were bled in 6 anticoagulant formulations (A, B, C, D, E and F). No profound difference in cell density between captive and wild groups with the mean value of 0.883x107 a cells/mL and 0.917x107 cells/mL, respectively. while, the cell viability of the captive group was significantly lower than the wild crabs (F=808.075, p<0.001). Anticoagulant formulation significantly affected cell viability and cell morphology in both captive and wild groups (p<0.001). Amebocyte cells collected from the wild T. gigas using optimum anticoagulant (formula C) showed 0.6 x107 cells/mL cell density and 86.9% cell viability, while morphology analysis revealed the percentage of contracted, granular flattened and degranulated flattened cells were 14.62%, 71.39% and 14%, respectively. The anticoagulant formulations showed varying capabilities in maintaining cell viability due to its buffering and chelating capacity.

Reaching high resolution for a broader range of samples is uncommon due to beam-induced sample drift, poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of images, challenges in CTF correction, limited number of particles. Here we propose a strategy to address these issues, which consists of a tomographic data collection scheme and a processing workflow. Tilt series are collected with higher electron dose at zero-degree tilt in order to increase SNR. Next, after performing StA conventionally, we extract 2D projections of the particles of interest from the higher SNR images and use the single particle analysis tools to refine the particle alignment and generate a reconstruction.

Nevertheless, some species like Tubastraea coccinea and T. tagusensis have been spreading very fast replacing the native ones which affect the local environment and decrease biodiversity of corals and other organisms associated with them. Despite some focal efforts to understand the biology of these organisms, they remain understudied at the molecular level. This knowledge gap hinders the development of cost-effective strategies for both conservation and management of invasive species. In this circumstance, it is expected that genome sequencing would provide powerful insights that could lead to better strategies for prevention, management, and control of this and other invasive species. Here, we present three genomes of Tubastraea spp. in one of the most comprehensive biological studies of corals, that includes flow cytometry, karyotyping, transcriptomics, genomics, and phylogeny. The genome of T. tagusensis is organized in 23 chromosomes pairs and has 1.1 Gb, the T. coccinea genome is organized in 22 chromosome pairs and has 806 Mb, and the Tubastraea sp. genome is organized in 21 chromosome pairs and has 795 Mb. The hybrid assembly of T. tagusensis using short and long-reads has a N50 of 227,978 bp, 7,996 contigs and high completeness estimated as 91.6% of BUSCO complete genes, of T. coccinea has a N50 of 66,396 bp, 17,214 contigs and 88.1% of completeness, and of Tubastraea sp. has a N50 of 82,672 bp, 12,922 contigs and also 88.1% of completeness. We inferred that almost half of the genome consists of repetitive elements, mostly interspersed repeats. We provide evidence for exclusive Scleractinia and Tubastraea gene content related to adhesion and immunity. The Tubastraea spp. genomes are a fundamental study which promises to provide insights not only about the genetic basis for the extreme invasiveness of this particular coral genus, but to understand the adaptation flaws of some reef corals in the face of anthropic-induced environmental disturbances. We expect the data generated in this study will foster the development of efficient technologies for the management of coral species, whether invasive or threatened.","NA"

While the microglial receptor TREM2 and the soluble complement proteins C1q and C3 are recognized key players in this process, the neuronal molecular components that tag synapses to be eliminated are still undefined. Here we show that exposed phosphatidylserine (PS) represents a neuronal  eat-me signal enabling microglial-mediated synapse pruning. In hippocampal neuron and microglia co-cultures, synapse elimination can be prevented by blocking accessibility of exposed PS using Annexin V or through microglial loss of TREM2. In vivo, exposed PS is detectable at both hippocampal and retinogeniculate synapses, where exposure coincides with the onset of synapse elimination and increased PS engulfment by microglia. Mice deficient in C1q, which fail to properly refine retinogeniculate connections, display elevated exposed PS and reduced PS engulfment by microglia. These data provide mechanistic insight into microglial-mediated synapse pruning and identify a novel role of developmentally regulated PS exposure that is common among developing brain structures.","NA"

An emerging approach is ""brain decoding"", which consists of inferring a set of experimental conditions performed by a participant, using pattern classification of brain activity. Few works so far have attempted to train a brain decoding model that would generalize across many different cognitive tasks drawn from multiple cognitive domains. To tackle this problem, we proposed a domain-general brain decoder that automatically learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain response within a short time window using a deep learning approach. By leveraging our prior knowledge on network organization of human brain cognition, we constructed deep graph convolutional neural networks to annotate cognitive states by first mapping the task-evoked fMRI response onto a brain graph, propagating brain dynamics among interconnected brain regions and functional networks, and generating state-specific representations of recorded brain activity. We evaluated the decoding model on a large population of 1200 participants, under 21 different experimental conditions spanning 6 different cognitive domains, acquired from the Human Connectome Project task-fMRI database. Using a 10s window of fMRI response, the 21 cognitive states were identified with a test accuracy of 89% (chance level 4.8%). Performance remained good when using a 6s window (82%). It was even feasible to decode cognitive states from a single fMRI volume (720ms), with the performance following the shape of the hemodynamic response. Moreover, a saliency map analysis demonstrated that the high decoding performance was driven by the response of biologically meaningful brain regions. Together, we provide an automated tool to annotate human brain activity with fine temporal resolution and fine cognitive granularity. Our model shows potential applications as a reference model for domain adaptation, possibly making contributions in a variety of domains, including neurological and psychiatric disorders.","NA"

S-Lic is the main enantiomer responsible for anticonvulsant activity and this is proposed to be through the blockade of voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs). ESL and S-Lic both have a voltage-dependent inhibitory effect on the Na+ current in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells expressing neuronal VGSC subtypes including Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.6 and Nav1.7. ESL has not been associated with cardiotoxicity in healthy volunteers, although a prolongation of the electrocardiographic PR interval has been observed, suggesting that ESL may also inhibit cardiac Nav1.5 isoform. However, this has not previously been studied. Here, we investigated the electrophysiological effects of ESL and S-Lic on Nav1.5 using whole-cell patch clamp recording. We interrogated two model systems: (1) MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast carcinoma cells, which endogenously express the  neonatal Nav1.5 splice variant, and (2) HEK-293 cells stably over-expressing the  adult Nav1.5 splice variant. We show that both ESL and S-Lic inhibit transient and persistent Na+ current, hyperpolarise the voltage-dependence of slow inactivation, and slow the recovery from channel inactivation. These findings highlight, for the first time, the potent inhibitory effects of ESL and S-Lic on the Nav1.5 isoform, suggesting a possible explanation for the prolonged PR interval observed in patients on ESL treatment. Given that numerous cancer cells have also been shown to express Nav1.5, and that VGSCs potentiate invasion and metastasis, this study also paves the way for future investigations into ESL and S-Lic as potential invasion inhibitors.","NA"

We stimulated internal capsule/striatum in participants undergoing intracranial epilepsy monitoring as they performed a cognitive control task. Stimulation enhanced performance, with the strongest effects from dorsal capsule/striatum stimulation. We then developed a framework to detect control lapses and stimulate in response. This closed-loop approach was more effective than open-loop stimulation.

There exist effective experimental methods of accomplishing this, such as cell sorting and baiting; however they are time consuming and expensive. Next generation sequencing of B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires offers an additional source of sequences that could be tapped if we had a reliable method of selecting those coding for the best antibodies. In this paper we introduce a method that uses evolutionary information from the family of related sequences that share a naive ancestor to predict the affinity of each resulting antibody for its antigen. When combined with information on the identity of the antigen, this method should provide a source of effective new antibodies. We also introduce a method for a related task: given an antibody of interest and its inferred ancestral lineage, which branches in the tree are likely to harbor key affinity-increasing mutations?

This approach resulted in 154 hybrid scaffolds (N50 = 34.3 Mb) spanning 999.9 Mb and in 414.7 Mb of unscaffolded sequences. Anchoring 31 scaffolds with a genetic map was sufficient to represent an entire haploid genome of 17 pseudomolecules (719.4 Mb).

This is, in turn, associated with greater opioid analgesic use, potentially contributing to current and future opioid crises. We utilise an animal model to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying increased opioid use associated with high anxiety and chronic pain.

Combining a genetic model of negative affect, the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat, and intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA; 1mg), our model of high anxiety and augmented OA-like pain behaviour mirrors the clinical problem. Effects of morphine (0.5-6mg.kg-1) on pain behaviour and spinal nociceptive neuronal activity were determined in WKY rats, and normo-anxiety Wistar rats, 3 weeks after MIA injection. WKY rats developed augmented OA-like pain, and had blunted inhibitory responses to morphine, when compared to Wistar rats. Potential alterations in endogenous opioid function were probed via systemic blockade of opioid receptors with naloxone (0.1-1mg.kg-1), quantification of circulating levels of {beta}-endorphin, and determination of spinal expression of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). These studies revealed increased opioidergic tone, and increased spinal desensitization of MORs via the master phosphorylation site at serine residue 375, in this model.

We demonstrate attenuated MOR function in the absence of previous exogenous opioid ligand exposure in our model of high anxiety and OA-like pain, which may account for reduced analgesic effect of morphine and provide a potential explanation for increased opioid analgesic intake in high anxiety chronic pain patients.

Significance StatementChronic pain affects large numbers of people, and pain management often relies on poorly effective opioid analgesics, the iatrogenic effects of which are increasingly recognised. The endogenous opioid system - the target for exogenous opioid analgesics - plays key roles in emotional affective states and pain control, but the complex interplay between anxiety, chronic pain, and endogenous opioid system function is challenging to study in people. Here, we have addressed this using a clinically-relevant experimental model. Anxiety-like behaviour was associated with increased chronic arthritis-like pain behaviour, altered opioid receptor function, and reduced efficacy of opioid analgesics. We provide new evidence, which may explain why chronic pain patients with comorbid high anxiety have higher opioid analgesic use.","NA"

Here, we investigated how humans synergistically activate muscles during locomotion at different submaximal and maximal speeds. We analysed the duration and complexity (or irregularity) over time of motor primitives, the temporal components of muscle synergies. We found that the challenge imposed by controlling high-speed locomotion forces the central nervous system to produce muscle activation patterns that are wider and less complex relative to the duration of the gait cycle. The motor modules, or time-independent coefficients, were redistributed as locomotion speed changed. These outcomes show that robust locomotion control at challenging speeds is achieved by modulating the relative contribution of muscle activations and producing less complex and wider control signals, whereas slow speeds allow for more irregular control.","NA"

Using operant behavioral paradigms provides rich data sets allowing for the careful analysis of behavioral phenotypes. However, one major limitation in these studies is the expense and work-load that are required using traditional methods. The equipment for commercial operant boxes can be prohibitively expensive, and the daily experimenter effort and mouse costs required for these studies is extensive. Rodents are generally trained on task-specific paradigms for months, tested every day for 5-7 days per week. Additionally, appetitive paradigms usually require food restriction and are also commonly run in the non-active light phase of the rodent circadian rhythm. These limitations make operant behavioral testing especially difficult during adolescence, a time period of interest with regards to the development of adult-like phenotypes and a high-risk period for the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, including those which involve impulsive behavior. In order to address these issues, we developed an automated, inexpensive, open-source method which allows the implementation of most standard operant paradigms in the homecage of rodents in shorter time frames without food restriction, and with much less experimenter effort. All construction and code for the DIY Nautiyal Automated Modular Instrumental Conditioning (DIY-NAMIC) system are open source. We demonstrate their utility here by measuring impulsive behavior in a pharmacology experiment, as well as in adolescent mice.

Greg Stacey","University of British Columbia","2020-04-25",1,"cc_by_nc","new results","bioinformatics","Biological functions emerge from complex and dynamic networks of protein-protein interactions. Because these protein-protein interaction networks, or interactomes, represent pairwise connections within a hierarchically organized system, it is often useful to identify higher-order associations embedded within them, such as multi-member protein-complexes. Graph-based clustering techniques are widely used to accomplish this goal, and dozens of field-specific and general clustering algorithms exist. However, interactomes can be prone to errors, especially interactomes that infer interactions using high-throughput biochemical assays. Therefore, robustness to network-level variability is an important criterion for any clustering algorithm that aims to generate robust, reproducible clusters. Here, we tested the robustness of a range of graph-based clustering algorithms in the presence of network-level noise, including algorithms common across domains and those specific to protein networks. We found that the results of all clustering algorithms measured were profoundly sensitive to injected network noise.

Randomly rewiring 1% of network edges yielded up to a 57% change in clustering results, indicating that clustering markedly amplified network-level noise. However, the impact of network noise on individual clusters was not uniform. We found that some clusters were consistently robust to injected network noise while others were not. Therefore, we developed the clust.perturb R package and Shiny web application, which measures the reproducibility of clusters by randomly perturbing the network. We show that clust.perturb results are predictive of real-world cluster stability: poorly reproducible clusters as identified by clust.perturb are significantly less likely to be reclustered across experiments. We conclude that quantifying the robustness of a cluster to network noise, as implemented in clust.perturb, provides a powerful tool for ranking the reproducibility of clusters, and separating stable protein complexes from spurious associations.","NA"

Despite these differences, ILC is treated in the same way as IDC. We set out to identify alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of ILC with potential clinical significance.

MethodsWe used laser-capture microdissection (LCM) to separate tumor epithelium from stroma in 23 ER+ ILC samples. Gene expression analysis was used to identify genes that are enriched in the stroma of ILC, but not IDC or normal breast.

Results45 genes involved in regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) were enriched in the stroma of ILC, but not stroma from ER+ IDC or normal breast. Of these, 10 were expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and were increased in ILC compared to IDC in bulk gene expression datasets. PAPPA was the most enriched in the stroma compared to the tumor epithelial compartment in ILC. PAPPA encodes pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), a metalloproteinase that cleaves insulin-like binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4) increasing IGF-1 bioavailability and subsequent downstream signaling. Analysis of PAPPA and IGF1 associated genes identified a paracrine signaling pathway and active PAPP-A was shown to be secreted from primary CAFs. Comprehensive survival analysis across 3000 breast cancers identified PAPPA as a potential ILC-specific prognostic marker.

ConclusionsThis is the first study to demonstrate molecular differences in the TME between ILC and IDC and identifies PAPP-A, a CAF-derived proteinase, as a potential prognostic marker.","NA"

The phenotypic consequences resulting from (pp)pGpp accumulation vary among species and can be mediated by different underlying mechanisms. Most genome-wide analyses have been performed under stress conditions, which often mask the immediate effects of (pp)pGpp-mediated regulatory circuits. In Staphylococcus aureus, (pp)pGpp can be synthesized via the RelA-SpoT-homolog (RSHSau) upon amino acid limitation or via one of the two small (pp)pGpp synthetases RelP or RelQ, upon cell wall stress. We used RNA-Seq to compare the global effects in response to transcriptional induction of the synthetase domain of RSH (RSH-Syn), RelP or RelQ without the need to apply additional stress conditions. Enzyme expression resulted in changes in the nucleotide pool similar to induction of the stringent response via the tRNA synthetase inhibitor mupirocin: a reduction in the GTP pool, an increase in the ATP pool and synthesis of pppGpp, ppGpp and pGpp. Induction of all three enzymes resulted in similar changes in the transcriptome. However, RelQ was less active than RSH-Syn and RelP, indicating strong restriction of its (pp)pGpp-synthesis activity in vivo. Genes involved in the SOS response, iron storage (e.g. ftnA, dps), oxidative stress response (e.g., katA, sodA) and the the psm1-4 and psm{beta}1-2 operons coding for cytotoxic, phenole soluble modulins (PSMs) were highly upregulated upon (pp)pGpp synthesis. Analyses of the ftnA, dps and psm genes in different regulatory mutants revealed that their (pp)pGpp-dependent regulation can occur independent of the regulators PerR, Fur, SarA or CodY. Moreover, psm expression is uncoupled from expression of the quorum sensing system Agr, the main known psm activator. The expression of central genes of the oxidative stress response protects the bacteria from anticipated ROS stress derived from PSMs or exogenous sources. Thus, we identified a new link between the stringent response and oxidative stress in S. aureus that is likely crucial for survival upon phagocytosis.

SignificanceMost bacteria make use of the second messenger (pp)pGpp to reprogram bacterial metabolism under nutrient-limiting conditions. In the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, (pp)pGpp plays an important role in virulence, phagosomal escape and antibiotic tolerance. Here, we analyzed the immediate consequences of (pp)pGpp synthesis upon transcriptional induction of the (pp)pGpp-producing enzymes RSH, RelP or RelQ. (pp)pGpp synthesis provokes immediate changes in the nucleotide pool and severely impacts the expression of hundreds of genes. A main consequence of (pp)pGpp synthesis in S. aureus is the induction of ROS-inducing toxic phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) and simultaneous expression of the detoxifying system to protect the producer. This mechanism is likely of special advantage for the pathogen after phagocytosis.","NA"

Phosphatidylserine (PS) on pre-synaptic elements binds GPR56 in a domain-specific manner, and microglia-specific deletion of Gpr56 leads to increased synapses as a result of reduced microglial engulfment of PS+ pre-synaptic inputs.

Materials and MethodsData were extracted from an enterprise-wide data warehouse for all patients who tested positive for influenza and were seen in ambulatory care between 2009 and 2019 (N = 7,278). A text processing pipeline was used to analyze chart notes for UMLS terms for symptoms of interest to improve data quality completeness. Three models, which step up complexity of the dataset and predictors, were tested with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-selected parameters to identify predictors for influenza. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves compared test accuracy across the three models.

ResultsThree models identified 7, 8, and 10 predictors, and the most complex model performed best. The addition of the UMLS-driven NLP symptoms data improved data quality (false negatives) and increased the number of significant predictors. NLP also increased the strength of the models, as did the addition of two-way predictor interactions.

DiscussionThe EHR is a feasible source for offering rapidly accessible datasets for influenza related prediction research that was used to produce a prediction model for influenza. Combining data collected in routine care with data science methods improved a prediction model for influenza, and in the future, could be used to drive diagnostics at the point of care.","NA"

Breeding programmes improve populations for a set of traits, which can be measured with a genetic trend calculated from averaged year of birth estimated breeding values of selection candidates. While sources of the overall genetic gain are generally known, their realised contributions are hard to quantify in complex breeding programmes. The aim of this paper is to present the AlphaPart R package and demonstrate it with a simulated pig breeding example.

ResultsThe package includes the main partitioning function AlphaPart, that partitions the breeding values and genetic trends by analyst defined paths, and a set of functions for handling data and results. The package is freely available from CRAN repository at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AlphaPart. We demonstrate the use of the package by examining the genetic gain in a pig breeding example, in which the multiplier achieved higher breeding values than the nucleus for traits measured and selected in the multiplier. The partitioning analysis revealed that these higher values depended on the accuracy and intensity of selection in the multiplier and the extent of gene flow from the nucleus. For traits measured only in the nucleus, the multiplier achieved comparable or smaller genetic gain than the nucleus depending on the amount of gene flow.

ConclusionsAlphaPart implements a method for partitioning breeding values and genetic trends and provides a useful tool for quantifying the sources of genetic gain in breeding programmes. The use of AlphaPart will help breeders to better understand or improve their breeding programmes.","NA"

Previous attempts focus on the pacemaker-accumulator model of time perception, which includes a clock, memory, and decision-making stage, wherein emotion affects one of these stages; possibly by increasing pacemaker rate via arousal, increasing accumulation rate via attention, or by biasing decision-making. To further investigate the stage(s) that emotion is affecting time perception we conducted a visual temporal bisection task with sub-second intervals while recording 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). To separate the influence of face and timing responses the temporal stimulus was preceded and followed by a face stimulus displaying a neutral or negative expression creating three trial-types: Neg[-&gt;]Neut, Neut[-&gt;]Neg, or Neut[-&gt;]Neut. The data revealed a leftward shift in bisection point (BP) in Neg[-&gt;]Neut and Neut[-&gt;]Neg suggesting an overestimation of time. Neurally, we found the face-responsive N170 component was larger for negative faces and the N1 and contingent negative variation (CNV) were larger when preceded by a negative face. We also found an interaction effect between condition and response for the late positive component of timing (LPCt) and a significant difference between response (short/long) in the neutral condition. We conclude that a preceding negative face affects the clock stage leading to more pulses being accumulated, either through attention or arousal, as indexed by a larger N1, CNV, and N170; whereas viewing the negative face second biased decision-making leading to ""short"" responses being less likely, as evidenced by the LPCt.","NA"

Here, monodisperse templated scaffolds (MTSC) were fabricated and used as a well-defined porous scaffolds to study the effect of dynamic culture conditions on bone-like tissue formation. Human bone marrow derived stromal cells were cultured on MTSC or conventional salt-leached scaffolds (SLSC) for up to 7 weeks, either under static or dynamic conditions. Spinner flask bioreactors were used to provide dynamic culture conditions to apply mechanical loading on the seeded cells through wall shear stress. The influence of controlled spherical pore geometry of MTSC subjected to static or dynamic conditions on the cell response, specifically on bone-like tissue formation, structure and distribution was investigated. As revealed by collagen staining, mRNA expression levels and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images, dynamic conditions supported osteoblast cell differentiation and promoted a more regular extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and mineral distribution in both scaffold types compared to static conditions. The results showed that regulation of bone-related genes and the amount and the structure of mineralized ECM were dependent on scaffold pore geometry and the mechanical cues provided by the two different culture conditions. Under dynamic conditions, SLSC favored osteoblast cell differentiation and ECM formation, while MTSC enhanced ECM mineralization. The spherical pore shape in MTSC supported a more trabecular bone-like structure under dynamic conditions compared to MTSC statically cultured or to SLSC under either static or dynamic conditions. These results suggest that cell activity and bone-like tissue formation is driven not only by the pore geometry but also by the mechanical environment. This should be taken into account in the future design of complex scaffolds, which should favor cell differentiation while guiding the formation, structure and distribution of the engineered bone tissue. This could help to mimic the anatomical complexity of the bone tissue structure and to adapt to each bone defect needs.","NA"

Paramos have been regularly burned for many years, and it is not clear how paramo vegetation will respond to significant changes in their fire regimes. This study investigates differences in plant growth form composition, light levels and soil temperatures in paramo plots representing a range of recovery times since the last fire.

LocationReserva Ecologica El Angel and La Bretana Nature Reserve, Carchi, Northern Ecuador.

MethodsWe assessed the frequency of ten paramo growth forms, vegetation height, soil temperature, and light intensity in fifteen fire sites with historical records of fire (<1 - 15 years since fire), and one recently unburned site (at least 40 years since fire). A chronosquence of sites was used to assess potential changes in plant community composition in post-fire succession of paramo.

ResultsThe recovery of paramo vegetation after fire comprised three phases: initial recruitment with high growth form diversity, followed by reduced diversity, light and soil temperatures in dense tussock vegetation, and ultimately canopy height stratification with a return of diversity. All but one plant growth forms were represented in each of the three phases, and the changes reflected differences in relative abundance.

ConclusionsPost-fire paramo succession is characterized by clear shifts in the relative abundance of plant growth forms, ending with (co-)dominance of upright shrubs. The long-term consequences of such shifts for biodiversity and ecosystem function, given the widespread adoption of fire suppression policies in the paramo need careful, evidence-based consideration.","NA"

Isotopic and trace elemental chronologies from the depositional layers of speleothems, corals, bivalve shells, fish otoliths and other structures are routinely used to reconstruct climate, growth, temperature, geological, archeological and migratory histories. Advances in instrumentation have revolutionized the use of these structures and publications detailing new chemical and isotopic methods in sclerochronology and speleothem chronology have steadily increased in number. This is particularly true of fish, in which detailed origin, life-history, and migration history can be reconstructed from their otoliths.

Moreover, enormous heterogeneity has been commonly observed in the identity, frequency, and location of these aberrations across individuals with the same cancer type or subtype, and this variation naturally propagates to the transcriptome, resulting in myriad types of dysregulated gene expression programs. Many have argued that a more integrative and quantitative analysis of heterogeneity of DNA and RNA molecular profiles may be necessary for designing more systematic explorations of alternative therapies and improving predictive accuracy.

We introduce a representation of multi-omics profiles which is sufficiently rich to account for observed heterogeneity and support the construction of quantitative, integrated metrics of variation. Starting from the network of interactions existing in Reactome, we build a library of ""paired DNA-RNA anomalies"" that represent prototypical and recurrent patterns of dysregulation in cancer; each two-gene ""motif"" consists of a ""source"" regulatory gene and a ""target"" gene whose expression is ""controlled"" by the source gene. The pair motif is then ""active"" or ""realized"" in a joint DNA-RNA profile if the source gene is DNA-aberrant (e.g., mutated, deleted, or duplicated), and the downstream target gene is ""RNA-divergent"", meaning its expression level is outside the normal, baseline range. With M motifs, each sample profile has exactly one of the 2M possible configurations.

We focus our analyses on reduced configurations by selecting tissue-dependent minimal coverings that we define as the smallest family of motifs with the property that every sample in the considered population displays at least one active motif; these minimal coverings can be computed with integer programming. Given such a covering, a natural measure of cross-sample diversity is the extent to which the particular active motifs vary from sample to sample; this variability is captured by the entropy of the distribution over configurations.

We apply this program to data from TCGA for six distinct tumor types (breast, prostate, lung, colon, liver, and kidney cancer). This enables an efficient simplification of the complex landscape observed in cancer populations, resulting in the identification of novel signatures of molecular alterations which are not detected with frequency-based criteria. Estimates of cancer heterogeneity across tumor phenotypes reveals a stable pattern: entropy increases with disease severity. This framework is then well-suited to accommodate the expanding complexity of cancer genomes and epigenomes emerging from large consortia projects.","NA"

Here, we used EMG data gathered during mouse locomotion to investigate the effects of calculation parameters and data quality on two metrics for fractal analysis: the Higuchis fractal dimension (HFD) and the Hurst exponent (H). A curve is fractal if it repeats itself at every scale or, in other words, if its shape remains unchanged when zooming in the curve at every zoom level. Many linear and nonlinear analysis methods are available, each of them aiming at the explanation of different data features. In recent years, fractal analysis has become a powerful nonlinear tool to extract information from physiological data not visible to the naked eye. It can present, however, some dangerous pitfalls that can lead to misleading interpretations. To calculate the HFD and the H, we have extracted muscle synergies from normal and mechanically perturbed treadmill locomotion from the hindlimb of adult mice. Then, we used one set per condition (normal and perturbed walking) of the obtained time-dependent coefficients to create surrogate data with different fluctuations over the original mean signal. Our analysis shows that HFD and H are exceptionally sensitive to the presence or absence of perturbations to locomotion. However, both metrics suffer from variations in their value depending on the parameters used for calculations and the presence of quasi-periodic elements in the time series. We discuss those issues giving some simple suggestions to reduce the chance of misinterpreting the outcomes.

New & NoteworthyDespite the lack of consensus on how to perform fractal analysis of physiological time series, many studies rely on this technique. Here, we shed light on the potential pitfalls of using the Higuchis fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent. We expose and suggest how to solve the drawbacks of such methods when applied to data from normal and perturbed locomotion by combining in vivo recordings and computational approaches.","NA"

Specifically, we found that in Lyl1-/- mice, the vascular structures of adipose tissues are unstable, more prone to angiogenesis and, consequently, cannot maintain adipose progenitors in the niche vessel wall.

Existing sample preparation methods for viral genome sequencing are demanding on user technique and time, and thus not ideal for time-sensitive clinical samples; these methods are also not optimized for high performance on viral genomes. We have developed MetagenomIc RNA EnRichment VirAl sequencing (MINERVA), a facile, practical, and robust approach for metagenomic and deep viral sequencing from clinical samples. This approach uses direct tagmentation of RNA/DNA hybrids using Tn5 transposase to greatly simplify the sequencing library construction process, while subsequent targeted enrichment can generate viral genomes with high sensitivity, coverage, and depth. We demonstrate the utility of MINERVA on pharyngeal, sputum and stool samples collected from COVID-19 patients, successfully obtaining both whole metatranscriptomes and complete high-depth high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genomes from these clinical samples, with high yield and robustness. MINERVA is compatible with clinical nucleic extracts containing carrier RNA. With a shortened hands-on time from sample to virus-enriched sequencing-ready library, this rapid, versatile, and clinic-friendly approach will facilitate monitoring of viral genetic variations during outbreaks, both current and future.","NA"

The evolutionary origin and maintenance of these colours remains a mystery. In this study, we reconstructed the ancestral states of both blue and green colouration in tarantula setae, and tested how these colours correlate with the presence of stridulation, urtication, and arboreality. Green colouration has likely evolved at least eight times, and blue colouration is likely an ancestral condition that appears to be lost more frequently than gained. While our results indicate that neither colour correlates with the presence of stridulation or urtication, the evolution of green colouration appears to depend upon the presence of arboreality, suggesting that it likely originated for, and functions in, crypsis through substrate matching among leaves. We also constructed a network of opsin homologs across tarantula transcriptomes. Despite their crepuscular tendencies, tarantulas express a full suite of opsin genes - a finding that contradicts current consensus that tarantulas have poor colour vision on the basis of low opsin diversity. Overall, our results support the intriguing hypotheses that blue colouration may have ultimately evolved via sexual selection and perhaps proximately be used in mate choice or predation avoidance due to possible sex differences in mate-searching.","NA"

The copy number of a particular molecule fluctuates in time due to the random occurrence of production and degradation reactions. Here we consider a stochastic model for a self-regulating transcription factor whose lifespan (or time till degradation) follows a general distribution modelled as per a multidimensional phase-type process. We show that at steady state the protein copy-number distribution is the same as in a one-dimensional model with exponentially distributed lifetimes. This invariance result holds only if molecules are produced one at a time: we provide explicit counterexamples in the bursty production regime. Additionally, we consider the case of a bistable genetic switch constituted by a positively autoregulating transcription factor. The switch alternately resides in states of up- and downregulation and generates bimodal protein distributions. In the context of our invariance result, we investigate how the choice of lifetime distribution affects the rates of metastable transitions between the two modes of the distribution. The phase-type model, being non-linear and multi-dimensional whilst possessing an explicit stationary distribution, provides a valuable test example for exploring dynamics in complex biological systems.","NA"

Membrane microdomains modulate protein-protein interactions and are essential for cell polarity, signaling and membrane trafficking. How cells organize their membrane microdomains, and the physiological importance of these microdomains, is unknown. In eukaryotes, the cortical actin cytoskeleton is proposed to act like a fence, constraining the dynamics of membrane microdomains. Like their eukaryotic counterparts, bacterial cells have functional membrane microdomains (FMMs) that act as platforms for the efficient oligomerization of protein complexes. In this work, we used the model organism Bacillus subtilis to demonstrate that FMM organization and movement depend primarily on the interaction of FMM scaffold proteins with the domains protein cargo, rather than with domain lipids. Additionally, the MreB actin-like cytoskeletal network that underlies the bacterial membrane was found to frame areas of the membrane in which FMM mobility is concentrated. Variations in membrane fluidity did not affect FMM mobility whereas alterations in cell wall organization affected FMM mobility substantially. Interference with MreB organization alleviates FMM spatial confinement whereas, by contrast, inhibition of cell wall synthesis strengthens FMM confinement. The restriction of FMM lateral mobility by the submembranous actin-like cytoskeleton or the extracellular wall cytoskeleton appears to be a conserved mechanism in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells for localizing functional protein complexes in specific membrane regions, thus contributing to the organization of cellular processes.","NA"

Ideally, clinicians could treat infections with antibiotics without fueling transmission of resistant pathogens. Here, we show proof of concept for an adjunctive therapy approach that allows treatment of target pathogens without the emergence and onward transmission of resistance. Like many of the bacterial species responsible for the antimicrobial resistance crisis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) is a colonizing opportunistic pathogen and an important cause of drug-resistant healthcare-associated infections. VRE causes life-threatening infections in the bloodstream, but spreads via fecal-oral transmission because it asymptomatically colonizes the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Thus, there is a physical separation between the VRE targeted by treatment (those in the blood) and the VRE contributing to onward transmission (those in the GI tract). An oral adjuvant that can bind or inactivate antibiotic in the GI tract would make possible intravenous patient treatment without promoting transmissible resistance. We tested this idea in a mouse model of VRE GI tract colonization using cholestyramine, which we show binds daptomycin, one of the few remaining front-line antibiotics against VRE. Adjunctive cholestyramine therapy reduced the fecal shedding of daptomycin-resistant VRE by up to 80-fold in mice treated with daptomycin.

Here we investigate the essentiality of lysine acetyltransferase KAT7 in AMLs driven by the MLL-X gene fusions. We found that KAT7 loss leads to a rapid and complete loss of both H3K14ac and H4K12ac marks, in association with reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis and differentiation of AML cells. Acetyltransferase activity of KAT7 is essential for the proliferation of these cells. Mechanistically, our data propose that acetylated histones provide a platform for the recruitment of MLL-fusion-associated adaptor proteins such as BRD4 and AF4 to gene promoters. Upon KAT7 loss, these factors together with RNA polymerase II rapidly dissociate from several MLL-fusion target genes that are essential for AML cell proliferation, including MEIS1, PBX3 and SENP6.

We found that as a citys housing density and median income increased it tended to support more migratory species and species with smaller body sizes and shorter lifespans.

Here, we introduce a low-cost, high-throughput method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, dubbed Pathogen-Oriented Low-Cost Assembly & Re-Sequencing (POLAR), that enhances sensitivity by aiming to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome rather than targeting particular viral loci, as in typical RT-PCR assays. To achieve this goal, we combine a SARS-CoV-2 enrichment method developed by the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/) with short-read DNA sequencing and de novo genome assembly. We are able to reliably (>95% accuracy) detect SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter, better than the reported limits of detection of almost all diagnostic methods currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. At higher concentrations, we are able to reliably assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy. Such genome assemblies enable the spread of the disease to be analyzed much more effectively than would be possible with an ordinary yes/no diagnostic, and can help identify vaccine and drug targets. Using POLAR, a single person can process 192 samples over the course of an 8-hour experiment, at a cost of ~$30/patient, enabling a 24-hour turnaround with sequencing and data analysis time included. Further testing and refinement will likely enable greater enhancements in the sensitivity of the above approach.","NA"

However, how Shigella rewires macrophages prior to epithelial cell invasion3 is poorly understood. Here we show that Shigella flexneri induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and triggers host pyruvate catabolism for energy acquisition before rapidly killing macrophages. To identify host factors modulated by S. flexneri, we performed genome-wide and focused secondary CRISPR knockout and CRISPRi screens in human monocytic THP-1 cells infected with S. flexneri and evaluated host cell survival. Knockdown of key components of the Toll-like receptor 1/2 signaling pathway significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, enhanced host cell survival, and controlled intracellular pathogen growth. Knockdown of the enzymatic component of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex also enhanced THP-1 cell survival. Small molecule inhibitors, which selectively inhibit key components of these pathways, enhanced host survival and limited intracellular pathogen growth. High-throughput CRISPR screens provide insights into the specific effects of S. flexneri on macrophages; these insights can potentially guide development of new therapies for shigellosis.","NA"

Here, we present an organisational principle that describes how the receptive field centre and surround can be balanced to achieve DC-balanced signal processing, which optimises the bandpass properties of the DoG model. Using computational modelling of human fMRI data, we demonstrate that population Receptive Fields (pRF) in primary visual cortex (V1) adhere to this principle. We infer that surround modulation is the likely mechanism responsible for the balancing, and we speculate on how the physiological structure of neurons and their interconnections provide a highly plausible framework of implementation for the proposed mechanism. Finally, we explore how the uncertainty principle for information sheds light on the advantageousness of the receptive field configuration principle for biological information processing.","NA"

Low nitrate fed Arabidopsis plants displayed reduced growth and compromised local and systemic acquired resistance responses when infected with both avirulent and virulent Pseudomonas syringae DC3000. These responses were enhanced in the presence of Trichoderma. The mechanism of increased local and systemic acquired resistance mediated by Trichoderma involved increased N uptake and enhanced protein levels via modulation of nitrate transporter genes. The nrt2.1 mutant is compromised in local and systemic acquired resistance responses suggesting a link between enhanced N transport and defense. Enhanced N uptake was mediated by Trichoderma elicited nitric oxide (NO). Low NO producing nia1,2 mutant and nsHb+ over expressing lines were unable to induce nitrate transporters and thereby compromised defense in the presence of Trichoderma under low N suggesting a signaling role of Trichoderma elicited NO. Trichoderma also induced SA and defense gene expression under low N. The SA deficient NahG transgenic line and the npr1 mutant were also compromised in Trichoderma-mediated local and systemic acquired resistance responses. Collectively our results indicated that the mechanism of enhanced plant defense under low N mediated by Trichoderma involves NO, ROS, SA production as well as the induction of NRT and marker genes for systemic acquired resistance.

Genomics-assisted breeding strategies can facilitate the selection of germplasm leading to new cultivars. While the most complete apple genome assemblies available to date are from anther-derived homozygous lines, de novo assembly of apple genomes encompassing the natural heterozygosity remains challenging.

This approach resulted in 154 hybrid scaffolds (N50 = 34.3 Mb) spanning 999.9 Mb and in 414.7 Mb of unscaffolded sequences. Anchoring 31 scaffolds with a genetic map was sufficient to represent an entire haploid genome of 17 pseudomolecules (719.4 Mb).

Only a limited number of immortalized hepatocyte cells have been reported. In this study, we generated an immortalized cell expressing CYP3A4 from a patient with drug-induced liver injury (DILI). To generate DILI-derived cells with a high expression of CYP3A4, we employed a three-step approach: 1. Differentiation of DILI-induced pluripotent stem cells (DILI-iPSCs); 2. Immortalization of the differentiated cells; 3. Selection of the cells with puromycin. We hypothesize that cells with a high expression of cytochrome P450 genes can survive even after exposure to cytotoxic antibiotics because of high drug-metabolism activity. Puromycin, one of the cytotoxic antibiotics, was used in this study because of its rapid cytocidal effect at a low concentration. Phenotypic studies in vitro revealed that the puromycin-selected cells (HepaSM or SI cells) constitutively expressed the CYP3A4 gene at an extremely high level, and continued to proliferate at least up to 34 population doublings for more than 250 days.

Osteoblasts produce the soluble receptor activator of NF{kappa}B ligand (RANKL) that binds to its receptor RANK on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells to promote osteoclastogenesis, a process that involves cell-cell fusion and assembly of molecular machinery to ultimately degrade the bone. CD13 is a transmembrane aminopeptidase that is highly expressed in cells of myeloid lineage has been shown to regulate dynamin-dependent receptor endocytosis and recycling and is a necessary component of actin cytoskeletal organization. In the present study, we show that CD13-deficient mice display a normal distribution of osteoclast progenitor populations in the bone marrow, but present a low bone density phenotype. Further, the endosteal bone formation rate is similar between genotypes, indicating a defect in osteoclast-specific function in vivo. Loss of CD13 led to exaggerated in vitro osteoclastogenesis as indicated by significantly enhanced fusion of bone marrow-derived multinucleated osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL, resulting in abnormally large cells with remarkably high numbers of nuclei with a concomitant increase in bone resorption activity. Similarly, we also observed increased formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGC) in CD13KO bone marrow progenitor cells stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13, suggesting that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion events via a common pathway, independent of RANKL signaling. Mechanistically, while expression levels of the fusion-regulatory proteins dynamin and DC-STAMP are normally downregulated as fusion progresses in fusion-competent mononucleated progenitor cells, in the absence of CD13 they are uniformly sustained at high levels, even in mature multi-nucleated osteoclasts. Taken together, we conclude that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion by controlling expression and localization of key fusion proteins that are critical for both osteoclast and MGC fusion.","NA"

While tissue tropism, host range, and pathogenesis of coronavirus are primarily controlled by the interaction of S protein with the cell receptor, it is possible that proteolytic activation of S protein by host cell proteases also plays a decisive role. The host-cell proteases have shown to be involved in the proteolysis of S protein and cleaving it into two functional subunits, S1 and S2, during the maturation process. In the present study, the interaction of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with different host proteases like furin, cathepsin B, and plasmin has been analyzed.

By acting on GABAergic and Ca2+-dependent signaling, current anti-spastic medications lead to serious side effects, including a drastic decrease in motoneuronal excitability which impairs motor function and rehabilitation efforts. Exercise, in contrast, decreases spastic symptoms without decreasing motoneuron excitability. These functional improvements coincide with an increase in expression of the chloride co-transporter KCC2 in lumbar motoneurons. Thus, we hypothesized that spastic symptoms can be alleviated directly through restoration of chloride homeostasis and endogenous inhibition by increasing KCC2 activity. Here, we used the recently developed KCC2 enhancer, CLP257, to evaluate the effects of acutely increasing KCC2 extrusion capability on spastic symptoms after chronic SCI. Sprague Dawley rats received a spinal cord transection at T12 and were either bike-trained or remained sedentary for 5 weeks. Increasing KCC2 activity in the lumbar enlargement improved the rate-dependent depression of the H-reflex and reduced both phasic and tonic EMG responses to muscle stretch in sedentary animals after chronic SCI. Furthermore, the improvements due to this pharmacological treatment mirror those of exercise. Together, our results suggest that pharmacologically increasing KCC2 activity is a promising approach to decrease spastic symptoms in individuals with SCI. By acting to directly to restore endogenous inhibition, this strategy has potential to avoid severe side effects and improve the quality of life of affected individuals.

Significance StatementSpasticity is a condition that develops after spinal cord injury (SCI) and causes major complications for individuals. We have previously reported that exercise attenuates spastic symptoms after SCI through an increase in expression of the chloride co-transporter KCC2, suggesting that restoring chloride homeostasis contributes to alleviating spasticity. However, the early implementation of rehabilitation programs in the clinic is often problematic due to co-morbidities. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacologically enhancing KCC2 activity after chronic SCI reduces multiple signs of spasticity, without the need for rehabilitation.","NA"

To address this, we have assembled a genome-scale collection of RBPs and their RNA binding domains (RBDs), and assessed their specificities using high throughput RNA-SELEX (HTR-SELEX). Approximately 70% of RBPs for which we obtained a motif bound to short linear sequences, whereas ~30% preferred structured motifs folding into stem-loops.

Translin (TN) protein and its partner, trax (TX), form the TN/TX microRNA-degrading enzyme. Since the microRNA system plays a prominent role in regulating metabolism, we reasoned that the metabolic profile displayed by Tsn KO mice might reflect dysregulation of microRNA signaling.

MethodsTo test this hypothesis, we inserted a mutation, E126A, in Tsnax, the gene encoding TX, that abolishes the microRNA-degrading enzymatic activity of the TN/TX complex. In addition, to help define the cell types that drive the adiposity phenotype, we have also generated mice with floxed alleles of Tsn or Tsnax.

ResultsIntroduction of the E126A mutation in Tsnax does not impair expression of TN or TX proteins or their co-precipitation. Furthermore, these mice display selective increases in microRNAs that match those induced by Tsn deletion, confirming that this mutation in Tsnax inactivates the microRNA-degrading activity of the TN/TX complex. Mice homozygous for the Tsnax (E126A) mutation display a metabolic profile that closely mimics that of Tsn KO mice.

Selective deletion of Tsn or Tsnax from either adipocytes or hepatocytes, two candidate cell types, does not phenocopy the elevated adiposity displayed by mice with constitutive Tsn deletion or the Tsnax(E126A) mutation. Furthermore, global, conditional deletion of Tsn in adulthood does not elicit increased adiposity.

ConclusionTaken together, these findings indicate that inactivation of the TN/TX microRNA-degrading enzyme during development is necessary to drive the robust adiposity displayed by Tsn KO mice.","NA"

We report here the evaluation of a library of additional nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues with regard to their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and then prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (Carbovir triphosphate, Ganciclovir triphosphate, Stavudine triphosphate, Entecavir triphosphate, 3-O-methyl UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2-O-methyl UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2-fluoro-dUTP, 2-amino-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP).

In this study, all of the nucleoside triphosphate analogues we evaluated form Watson-Cricklike base pairs. All the nucleotide analogues which demonstrated termination either lack a 2-OH, have a blocked 2-OH, or show delayed termination. These nucleotides may thus have the potential to resist exonuclease activity, a property that we will investigate in the future. Furthermore, prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Brincidofovir/Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA approved for other viral infections, and their safety profile is well known. Thus, they can be evaluated rapidly as potential therapies for COVID-19.","NA"

We propose a multivariate tensor-based orthogonal polynomial approach to characterize nucleotides or amino acids in a given DNA/RNA or protein sequence. Given quantifiable phenotype data that corresponds to a biological sequence, we can construct orthogonal polynomials using sequence information and subsequently map phenotypes on to the space of the polynomials. With enough computational power, this approach provides information about higher order interactions between different parts of a sequence in a dataset and ultimately illuminates the relationship between sequence structure and the resulting phenotype. We have applied this method to a previously published case of small transcription activating RNAs (STARs), quantifying higher order relationships between parts of the sequence and how these give rise to the distinct phenotypes.","NA"

ResultsHere, using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data we explore the divergence and conservation of human and mouse cerebral cortex development using 18,446 and 7,610 neocortical cells. Systematic cross-species comparison reveals that the overall transcriptome profile in human cerebral cortex is similar to that in mouse such as cell types and their markers genes. By single-cell trajectories analysis we find human and mouse excitatory neurons have different developmental trajectories of neocortical projection neurons, ligand-receptor interactions and gene expression patterns. Further analysis reveals a refinement of neuron differentiation that occurred in human but not in mouse, suggesting that excitatory neurons in human undergo refined transcriptional states in later development stage. By contrast, for glial cells and inhibitory neurons we detected conserved developmental trajectories in human and mouse.

ConclusionsTaken together, our study integrates scRNA-seq data of cerebral cortex development in human and mouse, and uncovers distinct developing models in neocortical projection neurons. The earlier activation of cognition -related genes in human may explain the differences in behavior, learning or memory abilities between the two species.","NA"

Current in vitro models do not preserve the cellular and mutational diversity of parent tumors and often require a lengthy generation time with variable efficiency. Here, we describe detailed procedures for generating glioblastoma organoids (GBOs) from surgically resected patient tumor tissue using a chemically defined medium without cell dissociation. By preserving cell-cell interactions and minimizing clonal selection, GBOs maintain the cellular heterogeneity of parent tumors. We include methods for passaging and cryopreserving GBOs for continued use, biobanking, and long-term recovery. We further describe procedures for investigating patient-specific responses to immunotherapies by co-culturing GBOs with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. This protocol takes approximately 2-4 weeks to generate GBOs and 5-7 days to perform CAR-T cell co-culture.

These approaches aim to map words to a low-dimensional vector space in which words with similar linguistic features are close in the vector space. These NLP approaches also preserve local linguistic features, such as analogy. Embedding-based approaches have also been developed for proteins. To date, such approaches treat amino acids as words, and proteins are treated as sentences of amino acids. These approaches have been evaluated either qualitatively, via visual inspection of the embedding space, or extrinsically, via performance on a downstream task. However, it is difficult to directly assess the intrinsic quality of the learned embeddings.

ResultsIn this paper, we introduce dom2vec, an approach for learning protein domain embeddings. We also present four intrinsic evaluation strategies which directly assess the quality of protein domain embeddings. We leverage the hierarchy relationship of InterPro domains, known secondary structure classes, Enzyme Commission class information, and Gene Ontology annotations in these assessments. These evaluations allow us to assess the quality of learned embeddings independently of a particular downstream task. Importantly, allow us to draw an analog between the local linguistic features in nature languages and the domain structure and function information in domain architectures, thus providing data-driven insights into the context found in the language of domain architectures. We also show that dom2vec embeddings outperform, or are comparable with, state-of-the-art approaches on downstream tasks.

Here, we tested how seasonal variation in thermal stratification and animal habitat preferences influence the distribution of eDNA in lakes. We sampled eDNA depth profiles of five dimictic lakes during both summer stratification and autumn turnover, each containing warm- and cool-water fishes as well as the cold-water stenotherm, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Habitat use by lake trout was validated by acoustic telemetry and was significantly related to eDNA distribution during stratification. Fish eDNA became ""stratified"" into layers during summer months, reflecting lake stratification and the thermal niches of the species. During summer months, lake trout, which rarely ventured into shallow waters, could only be detected at the deepest layers of the lakes, whereas the eDNA of warm-water fishes was much more abundant above the thermocline. By contrast, during autumn lake turnover, the fish species assemblage as detected by eDNA was homogenous throughout the water column. These findings contribute to our overall understanding of the ""ecology"" of eDNA within lake ecosystems, illustrating how the strong interaction between seasonal thermal structure in lakes and thermal niches of species on very localised spatial scales influences our ability to detect species.","NA"

These roles provide selection pressure for variation at both the structural/haplotype and base/allele levels. At the same time, the genes have evolved relatively recently by tandem duplication and therefore exhibit very high sequence similarity over thousands of bases. These variation-homology patterns make it impossible to interpret KIR haplotypes from abundant short-read genome sequencing data at population scale using existing methods. Here, we developed an efficient computational approach for in silico KIR probe interpretation (KPI) to accurately interpret individuals KIR genes and haplotype-pairs from KIR sequencing reads. We designed synthetic 25-base sequence probes by analyzing previously reported haplotype sequences, and we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to interpret the probes in the context of 16 KIR genes and 16 haplotype structures. We demonstrated its accuracy on a synthetic data set as well as a real whole genome sequences from 748 individuals from The Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL). The GoNL predictions were compared with predictions from SNP-based predictions. Our results show 100% accuracy rate for the synthetic tests and a 99.6% family-consistency rate in the GoNL tests. Agreement with the SNP-based calls on KIR genes ranges from 72-100% with a mean of 92%; most differences occur in genes KIR2DS2, KIR2DL2, KIR2DS3, and KIR2DL5 where KPI predicts presence and the SNP-based interpretation predicts absence. Overall, the evidence suggests that KPIs accuracy is 97% or greater for both KIR gene and haplotype-pair predictions, although the presence/absence genotyping leads to ambiguous haplotype-pair predictions with 16 reference KIR haplotype structures.

To this end, phylogenomic approaches leverage accumulating genomic mutations as barcodes to track the evolutionary history of the virus and can benefit from the surge of sequences deposited in public databases. Yet, such methods typically rely on consensus sequences representing the dominant virus lineage, whereas a complex sublineage architecture is often observed within single hosts. Furthermore, most approaches do not account for variants accumulation processes and might produce inaccurate results in condition of limited sampling, as witnessed in most countries currently affected by the epidemics.

We here introduce a new framework for the characterization of viral (sub)lineage evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which considers both clonal and intra-host minor variants and exploits the achievements of cancer evolution research to account for mutation accumulation and uncertainty in the data.

The application of our approach to 18 SARS-CoV-2 samples for which raw sequencing data are available reveals a high-resolution phylogenomic model, which confirms and improves recent findings on viral types and highlights the existence of patterns of co-occurrence of minor variants, uncovering likely infection paths among hosts harboring the same viral lineage. Our findings confirm a significant increase of genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in time, which is reflected in minor variants, and show that standard methods may struggle when handling datasets with important sampling limitations.

Importantly, our framework allows to pinpoint minor variants that might be positively selected across distinct lineages and regions of the viral genome under purifying selection, thus driving the design of treatments and vaccines. In particular, minor variant g.29039A>U, detected in multiple viral lineages and validated on an independent dataset, shows that SARS-CoV-2 can lose its main Nucleocapsid immunogenic epitopes, raising concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines targeting the C-terminus of this protein.

To conclude, we advocate the use of our framework in combination with data-driven epidemiological models, to deliver a high-precision platform for pathogen detection, surveillance and analysis.","NA"

Given that direct imputation needs a precise estimation of linkage-disequilibrium (LD) and that most of the methods using a small reference panel e.g., ~2,500 subject coming from the 1000 Genome Project, there is a great need for much larger and more diverse reference panels. To accurately estimate the LD needed for an exhaustive analysis of any cosmopolitan cohort, we developed DISTMIX2. DISTMIX2: i) uses a much larger and more diverse reference panel and ii) estimates weights of ethnic mixture based solely on Z-scores (when AFs are not available). We applied DISTMIX2 to GWAS summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium (PGC). DISTMIX2 uncovered signals in numerous new regions, with most of these findings coming from the rarer variants. Rarer variants provide much sharper location for the signals compared with common variants, as the LD for rare variants extends over a lower distance than for common ones. For example, while the original PGC post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) study found only 3 marginal signals for common variants, we now uncover a very strong signal for a rare variant in PKN2, a gene associated with neuronal and hippocampal development.

Here, we show that knocking out CREB1 triggered a remarkable effect of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and led to the occurrence of inhibited proliferation and enhanced motility in cancer cells. Mechanistically, CREB1-knockout cells showed arrest in the G0/G1 phase as a result of impaired CREB1-dependent transcription of CCAT1 and E2F1. Interestingly, the competition between the coactivator CBP/p300 for CREB1 and p65 leads to the activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway in cells with CREB1 disrupted, which induces an EMT phenotype and enhances motility. These studies identified previously unknown mechanisms of CREB1 in cell plasticity via its lncRNA and protein effector pathways, revealing an important feature that should be considered in CREB1-targeted tumour therapies.","NA"

Overactive growth during nutrient limitation (""nutrient-growth dysregulation"") can lead to rapid cell death. Here, we demonstrate that cells can adapt to nutrient-growth dysregulation by evolving major metabolic defects. Specifically, when yeast lysine auxotrophic mutant lys- encountered lysine limitation, an evolutionarily novel stress, cells suffered nutrient-growth dysregulation. A sub-population repeatedly evolved to lose the ability to synthesize organosulfurs (lys-orgS-). Organosulfurs, mainly glutathione and glutathione conjugates, were released by lys- cells during lysine limitation when growth was dysregulated, but not during glucose limitation when growth was regulated. Limiting organosulfurs conferred a frequency-dependent fitness advantage to lys-orgS- by eliciting a proper slow growth program including autophagy. Thus, nutrient-growth dysregulation is associated with rapid organosulfur release, which enables the selection of organosulfur auxotrophy to better tune cell growth to the metabolic environment. We speculate that evolutionarily novel stresses can trigger atypical release of certain metabolites, setting the stage for the evolution of new ecological interactions.","NA"

There are currently no effective vaccines available for livestock and so control relies on animal level surveillance and pasteurisation of dairy products. A new alternative control approach is to exploit the genetic variability of the host; recent studies have demonstrated that breeding Bos taurus cattle for increased resistance to bTB is feasible. The utility of such an approach is still unknown for the Bos indicus cattle population. This study aims to assess genetic variation in bTB resistance and the underlying genomic architecture in Bos indicus breeds in Cameroon.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of slaughter cattle in Cameroon and genotyped a sample of 213 cattle. Their genomic diversity was characterised using PCA, hierarchical clustering and admixture analysis. We assessed genetic variation in bTB resistance using heritability analysis and compared quantitative trait loci.

Previous studies had found that breed was an important factor in explaining the epidemiology of bTB, with Fulani cattle appearing to be more susceptible than mixed breeds. However, we show that the apparent phenotypic differences in visual appearance between the breeds was not reflected by clear genomic differences. At the genetic level, cattle belonging to different hierarchical genomic clusters differed in their susceptibility to bTB. There was evidence of a genomic association between M. bovis infection status with specific SNPs.

We highlight the need to understand the challenges faced by livestock in specific settings both in terms of pathogens and the environment, in addition to their intended purpose and how they fit into a defined management system. It is only at this point livestock keepers can then make informed breeding choices, not only for resistance to disease but also for increasing production.","NA"

It is used as last-resort drug to treat infections with multidrug-resistant strains. Colistin is also used in selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD), a prophylactic therapy used in patients hospitalised in intensive care units (ICUs) to selectively eradicate opportunistic pathogens in the oropharyngeal and gut microbiota. In this study, we aimed to unravel the mechanisms of acquired colistin resistance in Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens obtained from SDD-treated patients.

Routine surveillance of 428 SDD-treated patients resulted in thirteen strains with acquired colistin resistance (Escherichia coli n=9; Klebsiella aerogenes, n=3; Enterobacter asburiae, n=1) from five patients. Genome sequence analysis showed that these isolates represented multiple distinct colistin-resistant clones, but that within the same patients, colistin-resistant strains were clonally related. We identified previously described mechanisms that lead to colistin resistance, i.e. a G53 substitution in the response regulator PmrA/BasR, and the acquisition of the mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-1.1, but we also observed novel variants of basR with an 18-bp deletion, and a G19E substitution in the sensor histidine kinase BasS. We experimentally confirmed these variants to contribute to reduced colistin susceptibility. In a single patient, we observed that colistin resistance in a single E. coli clone evolved through two unique variants in basRS.

We show that prophylactic use of colistin during SDD can select for colistin resistance in species that are not intrinsically colistin-resistant. This highlights the importance of continued surveillance for the emergence of colistin resistance in patients treated with SDD.","NA"

It is one of the most closely related species to the M. tuberculosis complex. Using M. kansasii as a proxy for the M. kansasii-M. tuberculosis-common ancestor, we asked whether introducing the M. tuberculosis-specific gene pair Rv3377c-Rv3378c into M. kansasii affects the course of experimental infection. Expression of these genes resulted in the production of an adenosine-linked lipid species, known as 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd), but did not alter growth in vitro under standard conditions. Production of 1-TbAd enhanced growth of M. kansasii under acidic conditions through a bacterial cell-intrinsic mechanism independent of controlling pH in the bulk extracellular and intracellular spaces. Production of 1-TbAd led to greater burden of M. kansasii in the lung of C57Bl/6 mice during the first 24 hours after infection and ex vivo infections of alveolar macrophages recapitulated this phenotype within the same time frame. However, in long-term infections, production of 1-TbAd resulted in impaired bacterial survival in both C57Bl/6 mice and Ccr2-/- mice. We have demonstrated that M. kansasii is a valid surrogate of M. tuberculosis to study virulence factors acquired by the latter organism, yet shown the challenge inherent to studying the complex evolution of mycobacterial pathogenicity with isolated gene complementation.

On a larger scale, it reinforces the importance of horizontal gene transfer in bacterial evolution and examines novel models and methods to provide a better understanding of the subtle effects of individual M. tuberculosis-specific virulence factors in infection settings that are relevant to the pathogen.","NA"

To date, no other phytopathogenic bacteria are known to produce two phytotoxins. To elucidate the unique virulence of Psa6, we performed transcriptomic analysis of phytotoxin synthesis genes and type III effector genes in in vitro cultivation using various media. The genes related to phytotoxin synthesis and effectors of Psa6 were strictly regulated in the coronatine-inducing mediums (HS and HSC); 14 of 23 effector genes and a hrpL sigma factor gene were induced at 3 h after transferring to the media (early-inducible genes), and phytotoxin synthesis genes such as argD of phaseolotoxin and cfl of coronatine were induced at 6 and 12 h after transferring to the media (late-inducible genes). In contrast, induction of these genes was not observed in the hrp-inducing medium. Next, to examine whether the changes in gene expression in different media is specific to Psa6, we investigated gene expression in other related bacteria. For Psa biovar 1 (Psa1), biovar 3 (Psa3), and P. s. pv. glycinea (Psg), no clear trends were observed in expression behavior across various culture media and incubation times. Therefore, Psa6 seems to exert its virulence efficiently by using two phytotoxins and effectors according to environmental changes. This is not seen in other biovars and pathovars, so it is thought that Psa6 has acquired its own balance of virulence.","NA"

Growing evidence has emphasized the importance of both activation and repression of the host DDR by diverse DNA and RNA viruses. Previous work has shown that HIV-1 is also capable of engaging the host DDR, primarily through the conserved accessory protein Vpr. However, the extent of this engagement has remained unclear. Here we show that HIV-1 and HIV-2 Vpr directly induce DNA damage and stall DNA replication, leading to the activation of several markers of double- and single-strand DNA breaks. Despite causing damage and activating the DDR, we found that Vpr repress the repair of double-strand breaks (DSB) by inhibiting homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Mutational analyses of Vpr revealed that DNA damage and DDR activation are independent from repression of HR and Vpr-mediated cell-cycle arrest. Moreover, we show that repression of HR does not require cell-cycle arrest but instead may precede this long-standing enigmatic Vpr phenotype. Together, our data uncover that Vpr globally modulates the host DDR at at least two independent steps; offering novel insight into the primary functions of lentiviral Vpr and the roles of the DNA damage response in lentiviral replication.

IMPORTANCEThe DNA damage response (DDR) is a signaling cascade that safeguards the genome from genotoxic agents, including human pathogens. However, the DDR has also been utilized by many pathogens, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), to enhance infection. To properly treat HIV positive individuals, we must understand how the virus usurps our own cellular processes. Here, we have found that an important yet poorly-understood gene in HIV, Vpr, targets the DDR at two unique steps: it causes damage and activates DDR signaling, and it represses the ability of cells to repair this damage, which we hypothesize is central to the primary function of Vpr. In clarifying these important functions of Vpr, our work highlights the multiple ways human pathogens engage the DDR, and further suggests that modulation of the DDR may be a novel way to help in the fight against HIV.","NA"

To determine the degree to which distribution of pre-RC loading alone could account for chromosomal replication patterns, we mapped the binding sites of the Mcm2-7 helicase complex (MCM) in budding yeast, fission yeast, mouse and humans. We observed identical MCM double-hexamer footprints across the species, but notable differences in their distribution: In budding yeast, complexes were present in sharp peaks comprised largely of single double-hexamers; in fission yeast, corresponding peaks typically contained 4 to 8 double-hexamers, were more disperse, and showed a striking correlation with AT content. In mouse and humans, complexes were even more disperse, with a preference for regions of high GC content. Nonetheless, most fluctuations in replication timing in all four organisms could be accounted for by differences in chromosomal MCM distribution. This analysis also identified genomic regions whose replication timing was clearly not attributable to MCM density. The most notable was the inactive X-chromosome, which replicates late in S phase despite the fact that both MCM abundance and chromosomal distribution were comparable to those on the early replicating active X-chromosome. We conclude that, although certain genomic regions, most notably the inactive X-chromosome, are subject to post-licensing regulation, most differences in replication timing along the chromosome reflect uneven chromosomal distribution of stochastically firing pre-replication complexes.","NA"

Our findings fall into two categories. 1) phylogenetic distribution of TCSs: (i) the number and types of TCSs varies between species of the ESKAPEE pathogens; (ii) TCSs are group-specific, i.e., Gram-positive and Gram-negative, except for KdpDE; (iii) most TCSs are conserved among genomes of an ESKAPEE, except in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2) sequence variation: (i) at the operon level, the genomic architecture of a TCS operon stratifies into a few discrete classes; and (ii) at the gene sequence level, histidine kinases, responsible for signal sensing, show sequence and structural variability as compared to response regulators that show a high degree of conservation.

To test this hypothesis, we submitted wMelPop-infected D. melanogaster lines to 17 generations of experimental evolution at a high temperature, while enforcing late reproduction. The fly survival was measured at different time points, as well as two traits that have been proposed to be causally responsible for wMelPop virulence: its relative density and the mean number of octomom copies present in its genome.

Thus, there is an urgent need to explore new TB drugs and combinations, in order to shorten TB treatment and improve outcomes. Here, we evaluate the potential of two medicinal plants, Artemisia annua, a natural source of artemisinin (AN), and Artemisia afra, as sources of novel antitubercular agents.

Aim of the studyOur goal was to measure the activity of A. annua and A. afra extracts against Mtb as potential natural and inexpensive therapies for TB treatment, or as sources of compounds that could be further developed into effective treatments.

Materials and MethodsThe minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of A. annua and A. afra dichloromethane extracts were determined, and concentrations above the MICs were used to evaluate their ability to kill Mtb and Mycobacterium abscessus in vitro.

ResultsPrevious studies showed that A. annua and A. afra inhibit Mtb growth. Here, we show for the first time that Artemisia extracts have a strong bactericidal activity against Mtb. The killing effect of A. annua was much stronger than equivalent concentrations of pure AN, suggesting that A. annua extracts kill Mtb through a combination of AN and additional compounds. A. afra, which produces very little AN, displayed bactericidal activity against Mtb that was substantial but weaker than that of A. annua. In addition, we measured the activity of Artemisia extracts against Mycobacterium abscessus. Interestingly, we observed that while A. annua is not bactericidal, it inhibits growth of M. abscessus, highlighting the potential of this plant in combinatory therapies to treat M. abscessus infections.

ConclusionOur results indicate that Artemisia extracts have an enormous potential for treatment of TB and M. abscessus infections, and that these plants contain bactericidal compounds in addition to AN. Combination of extracts with existing antibiotics may not only improve treatment outcomes but also reduce the emergence of resistance to other drugs.","NA"

Cell membranes and the airway mucosal lining are rich in phospholipids that are particularly susceptible to oxidative attack, producing bioactive molecules including oxidized phosphatidylcholines (OxPC). With the recent discovery of elevated OxPC in animal models of asthma and asthmatic patients, we hypothesized that OxPC directly contribute to disease by inducing airway epithelial cell dysfunction.

We found that OxPC induced dose-dependent cell stress and loss of viability in a range of epithelial cell types. These responses corresponded with significant epithelial barrier dysfunction, which was further compounded when combining OxPC with an epithelial wound. OxPC significantly inhibited DNA synthesis and migration required for wound healing, but cells recovered if OxPC were washed off soon after treatment. OxPC induced extensive generation of reactive oxygen species that could not be abrogated by blockers of putative OxPC receptors, and caused extensive lipid peroxidation that could only be partially inhibited by the antioxidant n-acetyl cysteine. These outcomes were accompanied by profound mitochondrial dysfunction, raising the possibility that OxPC cause pathological lipid metabolism in a self-propagating cycle that contributes to disease pathogenesis.

In summary, we have identified OxPC as a group of bioactive molecules that significantly impairs multiple facets of epithelial cell function, consistent with pathological features of asthmatic epithelium. Further characterisation of the mechanisms by which OxPC affect epithelial cells could yield new insights into how oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of airway disease.","NA"

This near-critical-point operation adapts the segregation distance of replicated plasmids to the half-length of the elongating nucleoid, ensuring both cell halves to inherit one copy of the plasmids.

The basic machinery responsible for this regulated exocytosis consists of specific proteins present both at the plasma membrane and on insulin SGs. The protein composition of insulin SGs thus dictates their release properties, yet the mechanisms controlling insulin SG formation, which determines this molecular composition, remain poorly understood. VPS41, a component of the endo-lysosomal tethering HOPS complex, was recently identified as a cytosolic factor involved in the formation of neuroendocrine and neuronal granules. We now find that VPS41 is required for insulin SG biogenesis and regulated insulin secretion. Loss of VPS41 in pancreatic {beta}-cells leads to a reduction in insulin SG number, changes in their transmembrane protein composition, and defects in granule regulated exocytosis. Exploring a human point mutation, identified in patients with neurological but no endocrine defects, we show that the effect on SG formation is independent of HOPS complex formation. Finally, we report that mice with a deletion of VPS41 specifically in {beta}-cells develop diabetes due to severe depletion of insulin SG content and a defect in insulin secretion.

Here, we asked how habitat heterogeneity influences spatial structure (beta biodiversity) and phylogenetic structure (evolutionary processes) of benthic stonefly (Plecoptera, Insecta) communities.
C_LIO_LIWe sampled 20 sites along two Alpine rivers, including seven habitats in four different reaches (headwaters, meandering, bar-braided floodplain, and lowland spring-fed). We identified 21 morphological species and delineated 52 DNA-species based on sequences from mitochondrial cox1 and nuclear ITS markers. Using DNA-species, we first analysed the patterns of variation in richness, diversity, and composition by quantifing the contribution of each of the four reaches and seven habitats to the overall DNA-species diversity using an additive partition of species diversity analysis and distance-based redundancy analysis. Using gene-tree phylogenies, we assessed whether environmental filtering led to the co-occurrence of DNA-species using a two-step analysis to find a phylogenetic signal.
C_LIO_LIThe four reaches significantly contributed to DNA-species richness; with the meandering section displaying the highest contribution.

In spite of restoring hearing sensitivity, difficulties with understanding speech in noisy environments often remain. One main reason is that sensorineural hearing loss not only causes loss of audibility but also other deficits, including peripheral distortion but also central temporal processing deficits. To investigate the neural consequences of hearing impairment in the brain underlying speech-in-noise difficulties, we compared EEG responses to natural speech of 14 hearing impaired adults with those of 14 age-matched normal-hearing adults. We measured neural envelope tracking to sentences and a story masked by different levels of a stationary noise or competing talker. Despite their sensorineural hearing loss, hearing impaired adults showed higher neural envelope tracking of the target than the competing talker, similar to their normal-hearing peers. Furthermore, hearing impairment was related to an additional increase in neural envelope tracking of the target talker, suggesting that hearing impaired adults may have an enhanced sensitivity to envelope modulations or require a larger differential tracking of target versus competing talker to neurally segregate speech from noise. Lastly, both normal-hearing and hearing impaired participants showed an increase in neural envelope tracking with increasing speech understanding. Hence, our results open avenues towards new clinical applications, such as neuro-steered prostheses as well as objective and automatic measurements of speech understanding performance.

Thus, cellular and molecular signals other than primary mutations emerge as central players of GB. Here we describe the temporal organization of the events that occur in GB.

In the germarium, eya contributes to maintain the correct number of somatic and germinal cells by regulating the expression of steroidogenic genes in the ovary. In the vitellarium, eya facilitates follicle cells proliferation and contributes to regulate the cell program, in the context of basal ovarian follicle maturation.

However, how Toll receptors define polarized contractile interfaces remains unknown. Here we show that differential expression of Toll-8 polarizes Myosin-II through a physical interaction with the adhesion GPCR Cirl/Latrophilin. We report that Toll-8 activates Myosin-II by inducing Cirl asymmetric localization at the boundary of its expression domain. Cirl asymmetry is in turn sufficient to activate Myosin-II. Toll-8 and Cirl exhibit dynamic interdependent interactions to yield robust planar polarity when neighboring cells express different levels of Toll-8. This reveals how planar polarized signaling arises from a scalar gradient of a single Toll receptor interpreted through self-organized feedbacks with a GPCR.","NA"

Unlike most model-based ordination methods, both fixed and random effects are in our proposed model structured as p-dimensional vectors and added to the latent variables before the inner product with the species-specific coefficients. This changes the interpretation of the parameters, so that the fixed and random effects now measure the relative displacement of the vegetation by the fixed and random factors in the p-dimensional latent variable space. This parameterization allows statistical inference of the effect of fixed and random factors in vector space, and makes it easier for practitioners to perform inferences on species composition in a multivariate setting.

However, if standing genetic variation is limited, local adaptation may be restricted to different and potentially less optimal solutions (convergent evolution), or prevented from happening altogether. Using a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach, we identified genomic regions responsible for the repeated pelvic reduction (PR) in three crosses between nine-spined stickleback (NSS) populations expressing full and reduced pelvic structures (PS). In one cross, PR mapped to linkage group 7 (LG7) containing the gene Pitx1 known to cause PR. In the other two crosses, PR was polygenic and attributed to ten novel QTL, of which 90% were unique to specific crosses. Next we screened the genomes of individuals from 27 different NSS populations for deletions in the Pitx1 regulatory element (Pel), which is known to be associated with repeated PR in three-spined sticklebacks (TSS). This revealed deletions only in the population where PR mapped to LG7. Using individual-based forward simulations parametrised with empirical data on NSS and TSS population structures, we show that access to the same ancestral variation promotes parallel evolution (as seen in TSS), whereas lack thereof restricts local adaptation and instead promotes emergence of convergent genetic architectures (as seen in NSS). Hence, the results predict that with an increasing degree of population subdivision, parallel phenotypic evolution becomes increasingly non-parallel at the genetic level and restricts local adaptation to less optimal solutions.","NA"

We previously reconstructed a 1,000-year-old remedy containing onion, garlic, wine, and bile salts, which is known as  Balds eyesalve, and showed it to have promising antibacterial activity. In this paper, we have found this remedy has bactericidal activity against a range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive wound pathogens in planktonic culture and, crucially, that this activity is maintained against Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes in a model of soft-tissue wound biofilm. While the presence of garlic in the mixture is sufficient to explain activity against planktonic cultures, garlic alone has no activity against biofilms. We have found the potent anti-biofilm activity of Balds eyesalve cannot be attributed to a single ingredient and requires the combination of all ingredients to achieve full activity. Our work highlights the need to explore not only single compounds but also mixtures of natural products for treating biofilm infections. These results also underline the importance of working with biofilm models when exploring natural products for the anti-biofilm pipeline.

ImportanceBacteria can live in two ways, as individual planktonic cells or as a multicellular biofilm. Biofilm helps protect bacteria from antibiotics and makes them much harder to treat. Both the biofilm lifestyle and the evolution of antibiotic resistance mean we urgently need new drugs to treat infections. Here, we show that a medieval remedy made from onion, garlic, wine, and bile can kill a range of problematic bacteria grown both planktonically and as biofilms. A single component of the remedy - allicin, derived from garlic - is sufficient to kill planktonic bacteria. However, garlic or allicin alone do nothing against bacteria when they form a biofilm. All four ingredients are needed to fully kill bacterial biofilm communities, hinting that these ingredients work together to kill the bacteria. This suggests that future discovery of antibiotics from natural products could be enhanced by studying combinations of ingredients, rather than single plants or compounds.","NA"

The eyespots commonly found on butterfly wings each have concentric rings of differing colors and these serially repeated pattern elements have been a focus for evo-devo research. In the butterfly family Nymphalidae, eyespots have been shown to function in startling or deflecting predators, and to be involved in sexual selection. Previous work on a model species of Mycalesina butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, has provided insights into the developmental control of the size and color composition of individual eyespots. Experimental evolution has also shown that the relative size of a pair of eyespots on the same wing surface is highly flexible, whereas they are resistant to diverging in color-composition, presumably due to the underlying shared developmental process. This fixed color-composition has been considered as a prime example of developmental bias with significant consequences for wing pattern evolution. Here we test this proposal by surveying eyespots across the whole subtribe of Mycalesina butterflies and demonstrate that developmental bias shapes evolutionary diversification, except in the genus Heteropsis which has gained independent control of eyespot color-composition. Experimental manipulations of pupal wings reveal that the bias has been released through a novel regional response of the wing tissue to a conserved patterning signal. Our study demonstrates that development can bias the evolutionary independence of traits, but it also shows how bias can be released through developmental innovations, thus allowing rapid morphological change, facilitating evolutionary diversification.","NA"

This process of positive selection, deemed age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH), is associated with increased risk for cardiac disease and blood malignancies, like acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, it remains unclear why some people with ARCH do not progress to AML, even when their blood cells harbor well-known AML driver mutations. Here, we examine whether negative selection can play a role in determining AML progression by modelling the complex interplay of positive and negative selective processes. Using a novel approach combining deep learning and population genetic models, we detect pervasive negative selection in targeted sequence data from the blood of 92 pre-AML individuals and 385 healthy controls. We find that the relative proportion of passenger to driver mutations is critical in determining if the selective advantage conferred to a cell by a known driver mutation is able to overwhelm negative selection acting on passenger mutations and allow clones harbouring disease-predisposing mutations to rise to dominance. We find that a subset of non-driver genes is enriched for mildly damaging mutations in healthy individuals fitting purifying models of evolution suggesting that mutations in these genes might confer a protective role against disease-predisposing clonal expansions. Through exploring non drivercentric models of evolution, we show how different classes of evolution act to shape hematopoietic dynamics and subsequent health outcome which may better inform disease prediction and unveil novel therapeutic targets. We anticipate that our results and modelling techniques can be broadly applied to identify both driver mutations and those mildly damaging passenger mutations, as well as help understand the early evolution of cancer in other cells and tissues.","NA"

However, not much is known about the thermal vulnerability of marine intertidal species at this edge. We investigated the thermal vulnerability of the tidepool shrimp, Palaemon elegans in the fast-warming southeastern Mediterranean, its warm distributional edge. Tidepool organisms experience strong and fast thermal fluctuations. This might make them more resilient to change, but also bring them closer to their thermal limits during extreme conditions. To test the shrimps resilience, we tested three hypotheses: (1) P. elegance in the southeast Mediterranean has higher critical thermal maximum (CTMax) than in cooler regions, (2) the shrimp possess seasonal acclimatization, but (3) long exposure to extreme summer temperatures might erode its thermal performance making it vulnerable to future climate change. We characterized the shrimps thermal environment and population dynamics, determined CTMax and tested diverse physiological performance attributes (respiration, digestion, activity, growth) under a wide range of temperatures during winter and summer. P. elegans has a wide optimum performance range between 20-30{degrees}C during summer and its CTMax is 38.1{degrees}C, higher than its Atlantic counterparts. However, its warming tolerance is only 0.3{degrees}C, indicating low capacity for dealing with further warming in pools compared to northeast Atlantic populations that have wider tolerance. Prolonged exposure to current mean summer values in open water ([~] 32{degrees}C) would also significantly reduce its performance and increase mortality. This suggests that its population viability may be reduced under continuous regional warming and intensification of extreme events.","NA"

Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data from 10,163 individuals aged 4 to 99 years, on average 3.5 years apart, were used to compute rates of morphological change for 15 brain structures. We discovered 5 genome-wide significant loci and 15 genes associated with brain structural changes. Most individual variants exerted age-dependent effects. All identified genes are expressed in fetal and adult brain tissue, and some exhibit developmentally regulated expression across the lifespan. We demonstrate genetic overlap with depression, schizophrenia, cognitive functioning, height, body mass index and smoking. Several of the discovered loci are implicated in early brain development and point to involvement of metabolic processes. Gene-set findings also implicate immune processes in the rates of brain changes. Taken together, in the worlds largest longitudinal imaging genetics dataset we identified genetic variants that alter age-dependent brain growth and atrophy throughout our lives.

To this end, 18 locally isolated bacterial pure cultures screened and three strains showed high P- and K-solubilizing capabilities. Light microscopy, biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that strains 15a1 and 40a were closely related to Enterobacter hormaechei while strain 38 was closely related to Enterobacter cloacae (Accession number: MN294583; MN294585; MN294584). All Enterobacter spp. shared common plant growth-promoting traits, namely N2 fixators, indole-3-acetic acid producers and siderophore producers. Gibberellic acid was only produced by strain 38 and 40a, while exopolysaccharide formation was solely detected on agar containing colonies of strain 38. Under in vitro germination assay of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) seeds, Enterobacter spp. significantly improved overall germination parameters and vigor index (19.6%) of seedlings. The efficacy of root colonization of Enterobacter spp. on the pre-treated seedling root tips was confirmed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The pot experiment of bioprimed seeds of okra seedling showed significant improvement of the plant growth (> 28%) which corresponded to the increase of P and K uptakes (> 89%) as compared to the uninoculated control plants.

We studied acquisition of a classification task while recording single neurons in the dorsal-anterior-cingulate-cortex (dACC) and the Striatum. Monkeys performed trial-by-trial classification on a rich set of multi-cue patterns, allowing de-novo learning every few days. To examine neural dynamics during the learning itself, we represent each rule with a spanning set of the space formed by the stimuli features. Because neural preference can be expressed by feature combinations, we can track neural dynamics in geometrical terms in this space, allowing a compact description of neural trajectories by observing changes in either vector-magnitude and/or angle-to-rule. We find that a large fraction of cells in both regions follow the behavior during learning. Neurons in the dACC mainly rotate towards the policy, suggesting an increase in selectivity that approximates the rule; whereas in the Putamen we also find a prominent magnitude increase, suggesting strengthening of confidence. Additionally, magnitude increases in the striatum followed rotation in the dACC. Finally, the neural representation at the end of the session predicted next-day behavior. The use of this novel framework enables tracking of neural dynamics during learning and suggests differential yet complementing roles for these brain regions.","NA"

Previously we established that captive barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) underwent this characteristic decrease in body mass during their wing moult, even though they had unlimited and unrestricted access to food. In the present study we aimed to determine if this body mass loss during moult comprised mainly a reduction in fat stores, and to ascertain if the captive geese undergo pre-migratory and pre-winter fattening over a similar temporal scale to their wild conspecifics. The non-destructive technique of deuterium oxide isotope dilution was employed to provide repeated measurements of estimated fat deposition from a captive flock of fourteen barnacle geese. Birds were injected with deuterium oxide at 7 distinct intervals for one annual cycle. During the flightless period of the moult, body fat decreased by approximately 40% from the pre-moult value. During late-September and early October, body fat reached its highest point in the annual cycle, both as an absolute value and as a percentage of total body mass. We propose that while the energetic cost of wing moult is not the ultimate cause of fat loss in moulting barnacle geese, the approximate 212 g of fat catabolised during moult would provide sufficient energy to cover the cost of the replacement of the flight feathers, estimated to be 6384 kJ, over an approximate 42 day period. We conclude that the previously recorded increase in metabolism during moult in the geese, led to the use of endogenous fat reserves because the birds reduced rather than increased their food intake rates owing to the increased risk of predation when flightless. We also conclude that captive barnacle geese do undergo pre-winter and pre-migratory fattening, providing further evidence of the innate nature of these fat deposition cycles.","NA"

Here we explore the potential of a seemingly ideal phage, PYOSa, for combination phage and antibiotic treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infections. (i) This K-like phage has a broad host range; all 83 clinical isolates of S.aureus tested were susceptible to PYOSa. (ii) Because the mode of action of PYOSa S. aureus is unlikely to generate surface mutants resistant to PYOSa; none were observed in the 13 clinical isolates tested. (iii) PYOSa kills S. aureus at high rates. On the downside, the results of our experiments and tests of the joint action of PYOSa and antibiotics raise issues that must be addressed before PYOSa is employed clinically. Despite the maintenance of the phage, due to the ascent of potentially pathogenic small colony variants, PYOSa does not clear populations of S. aureus; following an initial demise the bacterial populations return to densities similar to that of phage-free controls. Bacteriostatic antibiotics prevent PYOSa from replicating on S. aureus and bactericidal antibiotics are antagonistic to the action of PYOSa. Using a combination of mathematical modeling and in vitro experiments, we postulate and present evidence for a mechanism to account for the demise-resurrection dynamics of PYOSa and S. aureus. Critically for phage therapy, our experimental results suggest that treatment with PYOSa followed by bactericidal antibiotics can clear populations of S. aureus more effectively than the antibiotics alone

Significance StatementThe increasing frequency of multiply antibiotic-resistant pathogens has fostered a quest for alternative means to treat bacterial infections. Prominent in this quest is a therapy that predates antibiotics: bacteriophage. This study explores the potential of a phage, PYOSa, for treating Staphylococcus aureus infections in combination with antibiotics. On first consideration, this phage, isolated from a commercial therapeutic cocktail, seems ideal for this purpose. The results of this population dynamic study identify a limitation and potential liability of using PYOSa for therapy. Due to the production of potentially pathogenic small colony variants, PYOSa alone cannot eliminate S. aureus populations. We demonstrate that by following the administration of PYOSa with bactericidal antibiotics, this limitation and potential liability can be addressed.","NA"

An initial screening under industrially relevant conditions, involving thirty Kluyveromyces marxianus strains, was carried out using spot assays to evaluate their capacity to grow on cheese whey or on whey permeate (100 g lactose/L), under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, in the absence or presence of 5% ethanol, at pH 5.8 or pH 2.5. The four best growing K. marxianus strains were selected and further evaluated in a miniaturized industrial fermentation process using reconstituted whey permeate (100 g lactose/L) with cell recycling (involving sulfuric acid treatment). After five consecutive fermentation cycles, the ethanol yield on sugar reached 90% of the theoretical maximum in the best cases, with 90% cell viability. Cells harvested at this point displayed probiotic properties such as capacity to survive the passage through the gastrointestinal tract and capacity to modulate innate immune response of intestinal epithelium, both in vitro. Furthermore, the CIDCA 9121 strain was able to protect against histopathological damage in an animal model of acute colitis. Our findings demonstrate that K. marxianus CIDCA 9121 is capable of efficiently fermenting the lactose present in whey permeate to ethanol and that the remaining yeast biomass has probiotic properties, enabling an integrated process for the obtainment of whey protein, fuel ethanol and probiotics from cheese whey.

2. ImportanceCheese whey is the liquid remaining following the precipitation and removal of milk casein during cheese-making. This by-product represents about 85-95% of the milk volume and retains 55% of milk nutrients so it can be exploited as a source of valuable end products. However, at a global level around 50% of cheese whey is wasted, representing an important environmental impact and indicating the need to develop alternative processes to recover value. Kluyveromyces marxianus is capable of fermenting lactose, generally regarded as safe, and has been explored separately as an ethanol producer and as a viable bioactive microorganism. The significance of our research is to establish the proof of concept that a biorefinery for fuel ethanol production using whey and K. marxianus can also be exploited to obtain viable probiotic biomass, conferring an added value to the process and providing an alternative to reduce environmental impact.","NA"

While early and accurate diagnosis is crucial, available assays have frustrating limitations

OBJECTIVEDevelop a simple, blood-based immunoassay to accurately diagnose patients suffering from active CDI.

MATERIALS AND METHODSUninfected controls (n=95) and CDI patients (n=167) were recruited from Atlanta area hospitals. Blood samples were collected from patients within twelve days of a positive CDI test and processed to yield serum and PBMCs cultured to yield medium enriched for newly synthesized antibodies (MENSA). Multiplex immunoassays measured Ig responses to ten recombinant C. difficile antigens.

RESULTSSixty-six percent of CDI patients produced measurable responses to C. difficile antigens in their serum or MENSA within twelve days of a positive CDI test. Fifty-two of the 167 CDI patients (31%) were detectable in both serum and MENSA, but 32/167 (19%) were detectable only in MENSA, and 27/167 (16%) were detectable only in serum.

DISCUSSIONWe describe the results of a multiplex immunoassay for the diagnosis of ongoing CDI in hospitalized patients. Our assay resolved patients into four categories: MENSA-positive only, serum-positive only, MENSA- and serum-positive, and MENSA- and serum-negative. The MENSA positive-only patients accounted for 30% and may be attributed to nascent antibody secretion in MENSA prior to seroconversion. Conversely, the serum positive-only subset may have been more advanced in their disease course. Immunocompromise and misdiagnosis may have contributed to the 34% of CDI patients who were not identified using MENSA or serum immunoassays.

IMPORTANCEWhile there was considerable overlap between patients identified through MENSA and serum, both methods detected additional, unique patients. The combined use of both MENSA and serum to detect CDI patients resulted in the greatest identification of CDI patients. Together, longitudinal analysis of MENSA and serum will provide a more accurate evaluation of successful host humoral immune responses in CDI patients.","NA"

Comparison of the C-ring structures in two rotational senses provide direct evidence that the C-ring undergoes major structural remodeling during rotational switch.

The overexpression of Osr40g3 under control of a constitutive promoter significantly improved salinity tolerance but impaired seed development in transgenic rice. Remarkably, transgenic Arabidopsis ectopically expressing Osr40g3 exhibited enhanced salinity tolerance but produced seeds normally. It was further confirmed that this Osr40g3-mediated impairment in seed development was due to pollen sterility in the transgenic rice while the pistils remained unaffected. The gene further displayed a precise tissue-specific expression pattern which was essential for proper seed development in rice. The constitutive overexpression led to the interaction of Osr40g3 with OsGF14e in the stamens presumably repressing it which led to pollen sterility. This interaction was, however, highly specific due to the structural distinctiveness of OsGF14e making the phenomenon rice-specific. Nevertheless, in salinity stressed leaves, Osr40g3 interacted with OsEG45 or its ortholog thus leading to salinity tolerance in both rice and Arabidopsis.","NA"

Cdc6 protein levels were very low, but increased upon treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. We also tested if these DNA replication proteins are regulated by cyclin dependent kinase (CDK). There are two main CDKs in Chlamydomonas, CDKA1 and CDKB1. We found that CDC6 protein level was severely reduced in a cdka1 mutant, but not in a cdkb1 mutant. MG132 did not detectably increase CDC6 levels in the cdka1 mutant, suggesting that CDKA1 upregulates CDC6 at the transcription level. Since MCM4, MCM6 and CDC6 were all essentially undetectable during the long G1 before DNA replication cycles began, we speculate that loading of origins with the MCM helicase may not occur until the end of the long G1, unlike in the budding yeast system. These results provide a microbial framework for approaching replication control in the plant kingdom.","NA"

However, viral and transposon small RNA regulatory pathways have not been systematically examined together in mosquitoes. Therefore, we developed an integrated Mosquito Small RNA Genomics (MSRG) resource that analyzes the transposon and virus small RNA profiles in mosquito cell cultures and somatic and gonadal tissues across four medically important mosquito species. Our resource captures both somatic and gonadal small RNA expression profiles within mosquito cell cultures, and we report the evolutionary dynamics of a novel Mosquito-Conserved piRNA Cluster Locus (MCpiRCL) composed of satellite DNA repeats. In the larger culicine mosquito genomes we detected highly regular periodicity in piRNA biogenesis patterns coinciding with the expansion of Piwi pathway genes.

Therefore, there is a growing need to identify predictive biomarkers and therapeutic combinations for improving the clinical efficacy.

ResultsBased upon the hypothesis that aberrations of any gene that are close to MHC class I genes in the gene network are likely to deregulate MHC I pathway and affect tumor response to anti-PD1, we developed a network approach to infer genes, pathway, and potential therapeutic target genes associated with response to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint immunotherapies in cancer. Our approach successfully identified genes (e.g. B2M and PTEN) and pathways (e.g. JAK/STAT and WNT) known to be associated with anti-PD1 response. Our prediction was further validated by 5 CRISPR gene sets associated with tumor resistance to cytotoxic T cells. Our results also showed that many cancer genes that act as hubs in the gene network may drive immune evasion through indirectly deregulating the MHC I pathway. The integration analysis of transcriptomic data of the 34 TCGA cancer types and our prediction reveals that MHC I-immunoregulations may be tissue-specific. The signature-based score, the MHC I association immunoscore (MIAS), calculated by integration of our prediction and TCGA melanoma transcriptomic data also showed a good correlation with patient response to anti-PD1 for 354 melanoma samples complied from 5 cohorts. In addition, most targets of the 36 compounds that have been tested in clinical trials or used for combination treatments with anti-PD1 are in the top list of our prediction (AUC=0.833). Integration of drug target data with our top prediction further identified compounds that were recently shown to enhance tumor response to anti-PD1, such as inhibitors of GSK3B, CDK, and PTK2.

ConclusionOur approach is effective to identify candidate genes and pathways associated with response to anti-PD-1 therapy, and can also be employed for in silico screening of potential compounds to enhances the efficacy of anti-PD1 agents against cancer.","NA"

However, the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and intermediate hosts that facilitate its transmission to humans remain unknown. The interaction of coronavirus with its host receptor is a key genetic determinant of host range and cross-species transmission. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter host cells in a species-dependent manner. It has been shown that human, palm civet, pig and bat ACE2 can support virus entry, while the murine ortholog cannot. In this study, we characterized the ability of ACE2 from diverse species to support viral entry. We found that ACE2 is expressed in a wide range of species, with especially high conservation in mammals. By analyzing amino acid residues of ACE2 critical for virus entry, based on structure of SARS-CoV spike protein interaction with human, bat, palm civet, pig and ferret ACE2, we identified approximately eighty ACE2 proteins from mammals that could potentially mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Functional assays showed that 44 of these mammalian ACE2 orthologs, including those of domestic animals, pets, livestock, and animals commonly found in zoos and aquaria, could bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. In contrast, New World monkey ACE2 orthologs could not bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. We further identified the genetic determinant of New World monkey ACE2 that restricts viral entry using genetic and functional analyses. In summary, our study demonstrates that ACE2 from a remarkably broad range of species can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry. These findings highlight a potentially broad host tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be distributed much more widely than previously recognized, underscoring the necessity to monitor susceptible hosts to prevent future outbreaks.","NA"

The wild progenitors of chickpea may provide a more diverse gene pool for Al-tolerance in chickpea breeding. However, the genetic basis of Al-tolerance in chickpea and its wild relatives remains largely unknown. Here, we assessed the Al-tolerance of six selected wild Cicer accessions by measuring the root elongation in solution culture under control (0 {micro}M Al3+) and Al-treatment (30 {micro}M Al3+) conditions. Al-treatment significantly reduced the root elongation in all target lines compared to the control condition after 2-days growth. However, the relative reduction of root elongation in different lines varied greatly: 3 lines still retained significant root growth under Al-treatment, whilst another 2 lines displayed no root growth at all. We performed genome-wide identification of multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) encoding genes in the Cicer genome. A total of 56 annotated MATE genes were identified, which divided into 4 major phylogeny groups (G1-4). Four homologues to lupin LaMATE (> 50% aa identity; named CaMATE1-4) were clustered with previously characterised MATEs related to Al-tolerance in various other plants. qRT-PCR showed that CaMATE2 transcription in root tips was significantly up-regulated upon Al-treatment in all target lines, whilst CaMATE1 was up-regulated in all lines except Bari2_074 and Deste_064, which coincided with the lines displaying no root growth under Al-treatment. Transcriptional profiling in five Cicer tissues revealed that CaMATE1 is specifically transcribed in the root tissue, further supporting its role in Al-detoxification in roots.

Fire suppression strategies, intended to conserve biodiversity and paramo ecosystem integrity and function, could lead to the accumulation of high fuel loads and ultimately fires of higher intensity. Yet the impact of fire intensity on paramos is not well studied or understood. 5[1/2] years after a fire, we measured plant growth form composition, light transmission to the ground and soil temperature in plots representing very high, high, medium, and low fire intensities, plus a ""control"" that had been unburned for at least 40 years. We also assessed Espeletia rosette diameters, heights, population density, and mortality. The low intensity plot, with a closed canopy of vegetation and lower growth form diversity, contrasted with the very high intensity plot, with patchy vegetation cover and higher growth form diversity. The high intensity plot had shorter Espeletia plants with smaller rosettes. Light transmission to the ground increased with fire intensity, as did soil temperatures. We demonstrate that the same fire can produce different microenvironmental conditions, plant communities, and population structures in different parts of the same fire event. In future, fire suppression could provoke more intense fires with consequences for ecosystem function and service provision.

Many possible explanations have been offered for this discrepancy, including existence of genetic variants poorly captured by existing arrays, dominance, epistasis, and unaccounted-for environmental factors; albeit these remain controversial. We believe a substantial part of this problem could be solved or better understood by incorporating the hosts microbiota information in the GWAS model for heritability estimation; ultimately also increasing human traits prediction for clinical utility. This is because, despite empirical observations such as (i) the intimate role of the microbiome in many complex human phenotypes, (ii) the overlap between genetic variants associated with both microbiome attributes and complex diseases, and (iii) the existence of heritable bacterial taxa, current GWAS models for heritability estimate do not take into account the contributory role of the microbiome. Furthermore, heritability estimate from twin-based studies does not discern microbiome component of the observed total phenotypic variance.

The recent development of high throughput patch-clamp provides a new momentum to the field. However, whole-cell voltage-clamp technique presents certain limits that need to be considered for robust data generation. One major caveat is that current amplitude profoundly impacts the precision of the analyzed characteristics of the ion current under study. For voltagegated channels, the higher the current amplitude is, the less precise the characteristics of voltagedependence are. Similarly, in ion channel pharmacology, the characteristics of dose-response curves are hindered by high current amplitudes. In addition, the recent development of high throughput patch-clamp technique is often associated with the generation of stable cell lines demonstrating high current amplitudes. It is therefore critical to set the limits for current amplitude recordings to avoid inaccuracy in the characterization of channel properties or drug actions, such limits being different from one channel to another. In the present study, we use kinetic models of a voltage-gated sodium channel and a voltage-gated potassium channel to edict simple guidelines for good practice of whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings.","NA"

The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) implements autonomous torque regulation by the nonequilibrium structure of the stators; the stators assemble at high load and disperse at low load. It would be natural to suppose that the stator packing is affected by stator-stator interaction. However, the cooperativity among the stators has rarely been explored. Here, we evaluated the energetics and kinetics of the stator assembly by combining dynamic load control of a single motor and the trajectory analysis based on statistical mechanics. We demonstrate that the BFM exploits the dynamic cooperativity of the stator binding for the autonomous torque regulation. The cooperative assembly leads to a discontinuous phase transition and hysteresis, which may implement torque regulation with high sensitivity and robustness.","NA"

Various microscopy and biomedical applications are based on the particles biocompatibility, surface functionalizability, light absorption, and plasmon resonances. Gold nanorods (AuNRs) are particularly promising for various sensor applications due to their tip-enhanced plasmonic fields. For biomolecule attachment, AuNRs are often stabilized with amphiphilic molecules and functionalized with antibodies or biotin-binding proteins. However, by their intrinsic size such molecules block the most sensitive near-field region of the AuNRs. Here, we used short cationic thiols to covalently functionalize the gold surface. We show that the functionalization layer is thin and that these polycationic AuNRs bind in vitro to negatively charged microtubule filaments. Furthermore, we can plasmonically stimulate light emission from the AuNRs and, therefore, use them as bleach- and blinkfree microtubule markers. We confirmed colocalization by transmission electron microscopy or the combination of interference reflection and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy of fluorescently-labeled or plasmonic photoluminescent versions of the AuNRs. We expect that polycationic AuNRs may be applicable to in vivo systems and other negatively charged molecules like DNA. In the long-term, microtubule-bound AuNRs can be used as ultrasensitive single-molecule sensors for molecular machines that interact with microtubules.","NA"

Edwards School of Medicine","2020-04-27",1,"cc_no","new results","cell biology","RationaleMost of the current anti-platelet drugs inhibit platelet function permanently and have systemic side effects, including thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage. We previously found that thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP), a platelet cytoplasmic protein, facilitates multiple agonist induced platelet activation and enhances thrombosis. A specific TYMP inhibitor, namely, tipiracil hydrochloride (TPI), has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for clinical use as an auxiliary drug making it possible to be repositioned as an anti-platelet medicine.

ObjectiveWe aimed to test the hypothesis that TPI is a novel and safe anti-platelet drug by examining its role in platelet activation and thrombosis using both in vitro and in vivo studies.

Methods and ResultsBy co-expression of TYMP and Lyn or Lyn-SH3 domain tagged with glutathione S-transferase, we showed the direct evidence that TYMP binds to the SH3 domain in its partners. TYMP haplodeficiency is sufficient to inhibit thrombosis in vivo regardless of gender. TPI treatment rapidly inhibited collagen- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation, which copied the phenotype of TYMP deficient platelets. Under both normal and hyperlipidemic conditions, treating wild type (WT) mice with TPI via intraperitoneal injection, intravenous injection, or gavage feeding dramatically inhibited thrombosis without inducing significant bleeding. Even administered above the effective dose, TPI has a lower bleeding side effect compared to aspirin and clopidogrel. Most importantly, intravenously delivery of TPI alone or combined with tissue plasminogen activator dramatically inhibited the growth of developing thrombi. Dual administration of very low dose of aspirin and TPI also dramatically inhibited thrombosis without disturbing hemostasis.

ConclusionThis pharmacological study demonstrated that TYMP participates in multiple signaling pathways in platelet and plays a mechanistic role in regulating platelet activation and thrombosis. TPI, a specific TYMP inhibitor, would be a novel safe anti-platelet and anti-thrombosis medicine.","NA"

Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) based homology search of 3350 known miRNAs of dicotyledons were allowed against 763 non-redundant ESTs of jute genome resulted in the prediction of 5 potential miRNA candidates belonging five different miRNA families (miR1536, miR9567-3p, miR4391, miR11300, and miR8689). The putative miRNAs were 18 nucleotide length, within a range of -0.49 to -1.56 MFEI values and 55% to 61% of (A+U) content of their correspondence pre-miRNAs. A total of 1052 gene targets of putative miRNAs were identified and their functions were extensively analyzed. Most of the gene targets were involved in plant growth, cell cycle regulation, organelle synthesis, developmental process and environmental responses. The five gene targets, namely, NAC Domain Containing Protein, WRKY DNA binding protein, 3-dehydroquinate synthase, S-adenosyl-L-Met-dependent methyl transferase and Vascular-related NAC-Domain were found to be involved in the lignin biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid pathways and secondary wall formation which could play significant roles in the overall fibre biogenesis.

Recent analysis shows that a two-beat run minimizes work only for animals with a small pitch moment of inertia (MOI), though empirical MOI were not reported. It also remains unclear whether MOI affects gait energetics at slow speeds. Here I show that a particular normalization of the pitch moment of inertia (the Murphy number) has opposite effects on walking and running energetics. During walking, simultaneous fore and hindlimb contacts dampen pitching energy, favouring a four-beat gait that can distribute expensive transfer of support. However, the required pitching of a four-beat walk becomes more expensive as Murphy number increases. Using trajectory optimization of a simple model, I show that both the walking and slow running strategies used by dogs, horses, giraffes and elephants can be explained by work optimization under their specific Murphy numbers. Rotational dynamics have been largely ignored as a determining factor in quadrupedal locomotion, but appear to be a central factor in gait selection.","NA"

Most of these enzymes share structural and sequence similarity. Tyrosine is a conserved residue present in the flap region of pepsin-like aspartic proteases. In apo protease, tyrosine remains in a dynamic equilibrium between normal and flipped states due to rotation of{chi} 1 angle (distributions of the{chi} 1 angle centred around [Formula] radian or [Formula] radian are denoted as normal, whereas distribution centred around {+/-}{pi} radian is denoted as flipped).

Metadynamics simulations using torsion angles ({chi}1 and{chi} 2 of Tyr) as CVs sampled transition between normal and flipped states. Qualitatively, flipped and normal states predicted to be equally populated. These states were stabilised by H-bond interactions to tryptophan (normal) and catalytic aspartate (flipped) respectively. Further, mutation of tyrosine to an amino-acid with smaller side-chain, such as alanine; reduced flap flexibility and resulted in a flap collapse. This is in accordance with previous experimental studies which showed that mutation to alanine resulted in loss of activity in pepsin-like aspartic proteases.

Ca2+-dependent activation of SERCA-PLB provides a rheostat function that regulates cytosolic and SR Ca2+ levels. While experimental and computational studies alone have led to a greater insight into the mechanisms for SERCA-PLB regulation, the structural changes induced by Ca2+ binding and how those are communicated to couple enzymatic activity with active transport remain poorly understood. Therefore, we have performed atomistic simulations totaling 32.7 s and cell-based intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments to determine structural changes of PLB-bound SERCA in response to Ca2+ binding. Complementary simulations and experiments showed structural disorder underlies PLB inhibition of SERCA, and Ca2+ binding is sufficient to shift the protein population toward a structurally ordered state of the complex. This structural transition results in a redistribution of structural states toward a partially closed conformation of SERCAs cytosolic headpiece. Closure is accompanied by functional interactions between the N-domain {beta}5-{beta}6 loop and the A-domain. Regulation of these key structural elements indicate that Ca2+ is a critical mediator of allosteric signaling that dictates structural changes and motions that pre-activate SERCA-PLB. These findings provide direct support that dynamically driven protein allostery underlies PLB regulation of SERCA. These functional insights at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution suggest a general modular architecture mechanism for dynamic regulation of the SERCA-PLB complex. Understanding these mechanisms is of paramount importance to guide therapeutic modulation of SERCA and other evolutionarily related ion-motive ATPases.","NA"

We perturbed the retinoic acid, Wnt, FGF and Nodal signaling pathways during gastrulation in amphioxus and zebrafish and comparatively examined its effects in gene expression and cis-regulatory elements (CREs). We found that multiple developmental genes gain response to these pathways through novel CREs in the vertebrate lineage. Moreover, in contrast to amphioxus, many of these CREs are highly interconnected and respond to multiple pathways in zebrafish. Furthermore, we found that vertebrate-specific cell types are more enriched in highly interconnected genes than those tissues with more ancestral origin.

To address this gap, we generated transcriptome profiles in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex of MDD subjects who died during a single or recurrent episode or when in remission. We show that biological changes associated with MDD trait (inflammation, immune activation, reduced bioenergetics) are distinct from those associated with MDD phases or state (neuronal structure and function, neurotransmission). On the cell-type level, gene variability in subsets of GABAergic interneurons positive for corticotropin-releasing hormone, somatostatin or vasoactive-intestinal peptide was associated with MDD phases. Applying a probabilistic Bayesian network approach, we next show that gene modules enriched for immune system activation, cytokine response and oxidative stress, may exert causal roles across MDD phases. Finally, using a database of drug-induced transcriptome perturbations, we show that MDD-induced changes in putative causal pathways are antagonized by families of drugs associated with clinical response, including dopaminergic and monoaminergic ligands, and uncover potential novel therapeutic targets.

Their activity is also correlated with various appetitive and consummatory behaviours as well as reward seeking. It is unknown how neural activity within and among these populations is coordinated. One hypothesis postulates that they communicate using inhibitory and excitatory synapses, forming local microcircuits. We inspected this hypothesis using quadruple whole cell recordings and optogenetics to screen thousands of potential connections in brain slices. In contrast to the neocortex, we found near zero connectivity within the LH. In line with its ultra-sparse intrinsic connectivity, we found that the LH does not generate local beta and gamma oscillations. This suggests that LH neurons integrate incoming input within individual neurons rather than through local network interactions, and that input from other brain structures is decisive for selecting active populations in LH.","NA"

Yet, there is a significant knowledge gap on how bio-elements interface with synthetic counterparts and function outside of their native environments. Here, we show that when enzymes are dispersed as nanoclusters confined within macromolecular matrices, their reaction kinetics, pathway, and substrate selectivity can be modulated to achieve programmable polymer degradation down to repolymerizable small molecules. Specifically, when enzyme nanoclusters are dispersed in trace amount (~0.02 wt%) in polyesters, i.e. poly(caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), chain-end mediated processive depolymerization can be realized, leading to scalable bioactive plastics for efficient sorting, such as recovery of precious metal filler from flexible electronics. Present studies demonstrate that when the enzyme is confined at dimensions similar to that of polymer chains, their behaviors are governed by the polymer conformation, segmental dynamic and thermal history, highlighting the importance to consider bioactive plastics differently from solution enzymology.","NA"

However, the majority of cancers do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) treatment, indicating the need to identify additional modalities that enhance the response to immune checkpoint blockade. In this study, we identified a tumor-tailored approach using ex-vivo DNA damaging chemotherapy-treated tumor cells as a live injured cell adjuvant. Using an optimized ex vivo system for dendritic cell-mediated T-cell IFN-{gamma} induction in response to DNA-damaged tumor cells, we identified specific dose-dependent treatments with etoposide and mitoxantrone that markedly enhance IFN-{gamma} production by T-cells. Unexpectedly, the immune-enhancing effects of DNA damage failed to correlate with known markers of immunogenic cell death or with the extent of apoptosis or necroptosis. Furthermore, dead tumor cells alone were not sufficient to promote DC cross-presentation and induce IFN-{gamma} in T-cells. Instead, the enhanced immunogenicity resided in the fraction of injured cells that remained alive, and required signaling through the RIPK1, NF-kB and p38MAPK pathways. Direct in vivo translation of these findings was accomplished by intra-tumoral injection of ex vivo etoposide-treated tumor cells as an injured cell adjuvant, in combination with systemic anti-PD1/CTLA4 antibodies. This resulted in increased intra-tumoral CD103+ dendritic cells and circulating tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells, leading to enhanced anti-tumor immune responses and improved survival. The effect was abrogated in BATF3-deficient mice indicating that BATF3+ DCs are required for appropriate T-cell stimulation by live but injured DNA-damaged tumor cells. Notably, injection of the free DNA-damaging drug directly into the tumor failed to elicit such an enhanced anti-tumor response as a consequence of simultaneous damage to dendritic cells and T-cells. Finally, the DNA damage induced injured cell adjuvant and systemic ICI combination, but not ICI alone, induced complete tumor regression in a subset of mice who were then able to reject tumor re-challenge, indicating induction of a long-lasting anti-tumor immunological memory by the injured cell adjuvant treatment in vivo.","NA"

Here we aim to identify, characterize and validate the methylation signatures that objectively classify PT into those molecular groups.

MethodsCombining in-house and publicly available data, we conducted an analysis of the methylome profile of a comprehensive cohort of 177 tumor and 20 non-tumor specimens from the pituitary gland. We also retrieved methylome data from an independent pituitary tumor (PT) cohort (N=86) to validate our findings.

ResultsWe identified three methylation clusters associated with functional status and adenohypophyseal cell lineages using an unsupervised approach. We also identified signatures based on differentially methylated CpG probes (DMP), some of which overlapped with pituitary-specific transcription factors genes (SF1 and Tpit), that significantly distinguished pairs of clusters related to functional status and adenohypophyseal cell lineage. These findings were reproduced in an independent cohort, validating these methylation signatures. The DMPs were mainly annotated in enhancer regions associated with pathways and genes involved in cell identity and tumorigenesis.

ConclusionsWe identified and validated methylation signatures that distinguished PT by distinct functional status and adenohypophyseal cell lineages. These signatures, annotated in enhancer regions, indicate the importance of these elements in pituitary tumorigenesis. They also provide an unbiased approach to classify pituitary tumors according to the most recent classification recommended by the WHO 2017 using methylation profiling.

In this study, we examined the gene-specificity of altered mRNA translation in FXS and the mechanism of rescue with genetic reduction of S6K1 by carrying out ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq on cortical lysates from wild-type, FXS, S6K1 knockout, and double knockout mice. We observed reduced ribosome footprint abundance in the majority of differentially translated genes in the cortices of FXS mice. We used molecular assays to discover evidence that the reduction in ribosome footprint abundance reflects an increased rate of ribosome translocation, which is captured as a decrease in the number of translating ribosomes at steady state, and is normalized by inhibition of S6K1. We also found that genetic removal of S6K1 prevented a positive-to-negative gradation of alterations in translation efficiencies (RF/mRNA) with coding sequence length across mRNAs in FXS mouse cortices.

Here, using biochemical and cell biology approaches, we show direct evidence that a specific GABP complex containing the subunit protein GABPB1L forms predominantly at the mutant TERT promoter, leading to TERT re-expression. Furthermore, we find that TERT promoter mutant GBM cells, unlike wild-type cells, are immediately dependent on GABPB1L for proliferation in cell culture and post-tumor establishment in vivo.

The breakthrough is delayed by the fact that studies jointly investigating the rodent hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are mostly targeted at understanding the spatial aspect of learning.

Normal functioning also requires flexible alteration of emotional responses when a threat becomes safe. Aberrant threat and safety learning occurs in many psychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia, where emotional responses can persist pathologically. Whilst there is evidence that threat and safety learning can be modulated by the serotonin systems, there have been few studies in humans. We addressed a critical clinically relevant question: How does pharmacological lowering of serotonin affect the retention of conditioned threat memory?

MethodsForty-seven healthy participants underwent threat conditioning on Day 1 followed by an extinction session. Emotional responding was assessed by the skin conductance response (SCR). On Day 2, we employed acute dietary tryptophan depletion to lower serotonin temporarily, in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized between-groups design. We then tested for the return of conditioned threat memory spontaneous recovery). We also measured self-reported intolerance of uncertainty, known to modulate threat memory expression.

ResultsThe expression of emotional memory was attenuated in participants who had undergone tryptophan depletion. Individuals who were more intolerant of uncertainty showed even greater attenuation of emotion following depletion.

ConclusionsThese results support the view that serotonin is involved in predicting aversive outcomes and refine our understanding of the role of serotonin in the persistence of emotional responsivity, with implications for individual differences in vulnerability to psychopathology.","NA"

HRF is mainly affected by physiological interferences which occur in the superficial layers of the head. This makes HRF extracting a very challenging task. Recent studies have used an additional near channel which is sensitive to the systemic interferences of the superficial layers. This additional information can be used to remove the systemic interference from the HRF.

New MethodThis paper presents a novel wavelet-based constrained adaptive procedure to define the proportion of the physiological interferences in the brain hemodynamic response. The proposed method decomposes the near channel signal into several wavelet transform (WT) scales and adaptively estimates proper weights of each scale to extract their share in the HRF. The estimation of the weights are done by applying data acquisition protocol as a coefficient on recursive least square (RLS), normalized least mean square (NLMS) and Kalman filter methods.

ResultsPerformance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and Pearsons correlation coefficient (R2) criteria between the estimated and the simulated HRF.

Comparison with Existing MethodsResults showed that using the proposed method is significantly superior to all past adaptive filters such as EMD/EEMD based RLS/NLMS on estimating HRF signals.

Conclusionswe recommend the use of WT based constraint Kalman filter in dual channel fNIRS studies with a defined protocol paradigm and using WT based Kalman filter in studies without any pre-defined protocol.","NA"

They reside in specialized microenvironments, or niches, within the bone marrow. The perivascular niche near blood vessels is believed to help maintain primitive HSCs in an undifferentiated state but demonstration of this effect is difficult. In vivo studies make it challenging to determine the direct effect of the endosteal and perivascular niches as they can be in close proximity, and two-dimensional in vitro cultures often lack an instructive extracellular matrix environment. We describe a tissue engineering approach to develop and characterize a three-dimensional perivascular tissue model to investigate the influence of the perivascular secretome on HSC behavior. We generate 3D endothelial networks in methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin hydrogels using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). We identify a subset of secreted factors important for HSC function, and examine the response of primary murine HSCs in hydrogels to the perivascular secretome. Within 4 days of culture, perivascular conditioned media promoted maintenance of a greater fraction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. This work represents an important first-generation perivascular model to investigate the role of niche secreted factors on the maintenance of primary HSCs.","NA"

Exosuits may be a more accessible alternative to current devices and have been used to successfully assist movement after a variety of motor impairments, but we know little about how they might assist post-stroke upper extremity movement. Here, we designed an exosuit actuator to support shoulder abduction, which we call an ""exomuscle"" and is based on a form of growing robot known as a pneumatic-reel actuator. We also assembled a ceiling-mounted support to serve as a positive control. We verified that both supports reduce the activity of shoulder abductor muscles and do not impede range of motion in healthy participants (n=4). Then, we measured reachable workspace area in stroke survivors (n=6) both with and without support. Our exomuscle increased workspace area in four participants (180{+/-}90 cm2) while the ceiling support increased workspace area in five participants (792{+/-}540 cm2). Design decisions that make the exomuscle wear-able, such as leaving the forearm free, likely contribute to the performance differences between the two supports. Heterogeneity amongst stroke survivors abilities likely contribute to a high variability in our results. Though both supports resulted in similar performance for healthy participants, the performance differences in stroke survivors highlight the need to validate assistive devices in the target population.","NA"

Based on in vitro and in vivo models, it was recently postulated that the deregulated expression in glioblastomas of key genes known to be involved in early neurogenesis could be the instigator of brain tumorigenesis.

ObjectivesOur objective is to show that the expression of such genes like RIT1 (Ras Like Without CAAX 1) which encodes an unusual ""orphan"" GTPase protein could be useful in early diagnosis of glioblastoma.

MethodsWe surveyed RIT1 expression and potential role in glioblastoma in-silico using various publicly available datasets.

ResultsWe showed a significant and progressive upregulation of RIT1 expression in various glioblastoma datasets. RIT1 expression ranked among the top upregulated genes (4-7%) and correlated with poor survival outcomes (HR =5.7, 95% CI). Genetic and epigenetic analysis didnt reveal significant aberrations that could underlie this deregulated expression, but its transcriptional activity could be significantly controlled by STAT3, one of the main players in the onset of glioblastoma.

ConclusionsThis is the first report that identifies RIT1 as an oncogene in glioblastoma paving thus the way for its potential use as a biomarker and therapeutic target.","NA"

Animal electrophysiological and human imaging studies have shown compartmentalisation of sensorimotor and cognitive functions within the cerebellum. In the present study, electrophysiological monitoring of sensory and motor pathways was carried out to assess the location of limb sensorimotor representation within the human cerebellum, as a potential approach for real time assessment of neurophysiological integrity to reduce the incidence of cerebellar surgical morbidities.

Thirteen adult and paediatric patients undergoing posterior fossa surgery were recruited. For sensory mapping (n=8), electrical stimulation was applied to the median nerves, the posterior tibial nerves, or proximal and distal limb muscles and evoked field potential responses were sought on the cerebellar surface. For motor mapping (n=5), electrical stimulation was applied to the surface of the cerebellum and evoked EMG responses were sought in facial and limb muscles.

Evoked potentials on the cerebellar surface were found in two patients (25% of cases). In one patient, the evoked response was located on the surface of the right inferior posterior cerebellum in response to stimulation of the right leg. In the second patient, stimulation of the extensor digitorum muscle in the left forearm evoked a response on the surface of the left inferior posterior lobe. In the motor mapping cases no evoked EMG responses could be found.

Intraoperative electrophysiological mapping, therefore, indicates it is possible to record evoked potentials on the surface of the human cerebellum in response to peripheral stimulation.","NA"

Focused ultrasound, for example, facilitates thermal ablation from a distance, thereby reducing injury to surrounding tissue. Focused ultrasound can often be performed noninvasively; however, it is more difficult to carry out in neuro-oncological tumors, as ultrasound is dramatically attenuated while propagating through the skull. This shortcoming has prompted exploration of MIS options for intracranial placement of focused ultrasound probes, such as within the BrainPath (NICO Corporation, Indianapolis, IN). Herein, we present the design, development, and in vitro testing of an image-guided, focused ultrasound prototype designed for use in MIS procedures. This probe can ablate neuro-oncological lesions despite its small size.

Materials & MethodsPreliminary prototypes were iteratively designed, built, and tested. The final prototype consisted of three 8-mm-diameter therapeutic elements guided by an imaging probe. Probe functionality was validated on a series of tissue-mimicking phantoms.

ResultsLesions were created in tissue-mimicking phantoms with average dimensions of 2.5x1.2x6.5mm and 3.4x3.25x9.36mm after 10- and 30-second sonification, respectively. 30s sonification with 118W power at 50% duty cycle generated a peak temperature of 68{degrees}C. Each ablation was visualized in real time by the built-in imaging probe.

ConclusionWe developed and validated an ultrasound-guided focused ultrasound probe for use in MIS procedures. The dimensional constraints of the prototype were designed to reflect those of BrainPath trocars, which are MIS tools used to create atraumatic access to deep-seated brain pathologies.

In normal mouse brain parkin was partially oxidized, e.g., at cysteines 195 and 252, which was augmented by oxidative stress. Although under basal conditions H2O2 levels were unchanged in adult prkn-/- brain, a parkin-dependent reduction of cytosolic H2O2 was observed when mitochondria were impaired, either due to neurotoxicant exposure (MPTP) or Sod2 haploinsufficiency. In accordance, markers of oxidative stress, e.g., protein carbonylation and nitrotyrosination, were elevated in the cytosol but not in mitochondria from prkn-/- mice. Nevertheless, this rise in oxidative stress led to changes in mitochondrial enzyme activities and the metabolism of glutathione in cells and mammalian brain. In parkin's absence reduced glutathione concentrations were increased including in human cortex. This compensation was not due to new glutathione synthesis but attributed to elevated oxidized glutathione (GSSG)-reductase activity. Moreover, we discovered that parkin also recycled GSSG to its reduced form. With this reaction, parkin became S-glutathionylated, e.g., at cysteines 59 and human-specific 95. This oxidative modification was reversed by glutaredoxin. Our results demonstrate that cytosolic parkin mediates anti-oxidant reactions including H2O2 reduction and glutathione regeneration. These reducing activities lead to a range of oxidative modifications in parkin itself. In parkin-deficient brain oxidative stress rises despite changes to maintain redox balance.","NA"

Suvorexant (Belsomra) is a dual orexin receptor 1/orexin receptor 2 (OxR1/OxR2) antagonist that is FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, and thus has the potential to be readily repurposed for the treatment of OUD. However, studies have yet to test the therapeutic potential of suvorexant with respect to reducing opioid-related behaviors. Accordingly, here we investigated the efficacy of suvorexant in reducing several addiction-relevant behaviors in fentanyl self-administrating rats. In rats with limited drug experience, suvorexant decreased motivation for fentanyl on a behavioral economics (BE) task. This effect was greatest in rats with the highest motivation for fentanyl. Suvorexant was even more effective at decreasing motivation for fentanyl following induction of a more robust addiction phenotype by intermittent access (IntA) self-administration of the opioid. Suvorexant also attenuated punished responding for fentanyl and reduced cued reinstatement in IntA rats. Suvorexant did not affect general locomotor activity or natural reward seeking, indicating that at the doses used here, suvorexant can be used to reduce drug seeking with limited sedative or off-target effects. Together, these results highlight the therapeutic potential of suvorexant, particularly in individuals with the severe OUD.","NA"

While it is known that mural cells (pericytes and smooth muscle cells) regulate vascular integrity, the contribution of other cell types to vascular stabilization has been largely unexplored. Using zebrafish, we identified sclerotome-derived perivascular fibroblasts as a novel population of blood vessel associated cells. In contrast to pericytes, perivascular fibroblasts emerge early during development, express the extracellular matrix (ECM) genes col1a2 and col5a1, and display distinct morphology and distribution. Time-lapse imaging reveals that perivascular fibroblasts serve as pericyte precursors. Genetic ablation of perivascular fibroblasts results in dysmorphic blood vessels with variable diameters. Strikingly, col5a1 mutants show spontaneous hemorrhage, and the penetrance of the phenotype is strongly enhanced by the additional loss of col1a2. Together, our work reveals dual roles of perivascular fibroblasts in vascular stabilization where they establish the ECM around nascent vessels and function as pericyte progenitors.

AUTHOR SUMMARYBlood vessels are essential to sustain life in humans. Defects in blood vessels can lead to serious diseases, such as hemorrhage, tissue ischemia, and stroke. However, how blood vessel stability is maintained by surrounding support cells is still poorly understood. Using the zebrafish model, we identify a new population of blood vessel associated cells termed perivascular fibroblasts, which originate from the sclerotome, an embryonic structure that is previously known to generate the skeleton of the animal. Perivascular fibroblasts are distinct from pericytes, a known population of blood vessel support cells. They become associated with blood vessels much earlier than pericytes and express several collagen genes, encoding main components of the extracellular matrix. Loss of perivascular fibroblasts or mutations in collagen genes result in fragile blood vessels prone to damage. Using cell tracing in live animals, we find that a subset of perivascular fibroblasts can differentiate into pericytes. Together, our work shows that perivascular fibroblasts play two important roles in maintaining blood vessel integrity. Perivascular fibroblasts secrete collagens to stabilize newly formed blood vessels and a sub-population of these cells also functions as precursors to generate pericytes to provide additional vascular support.","NA"

In addition to the CAR, promoters can be used to drive other genes of interest to enhance CAR T cell function. Expressing multiple genes from a single RNA transcript can be effectively achieved by linking the genes via a ribosomal skip site. However, promoters may differ in their ability to transcribe longer RNAs, or could interfere with lentiviral production, or transduction frequencies. In this study we compared the ability of the strong well-characterized promoters CMV, EF-1, hPGK and RPBSA to drive functional expression of a single RNA encoding three products: GFP, CAR, plus an additional cell-survival gene, Mcl-1. Although the four promoters produced similarly high lentiviral titres, EF-1 gave the best transduction efficacy of primary T cells.

Due to altered weight bearing, SLL causes structural alternations and inflammation of the interdigitating layers of specialized epidermal and dermal tissues, the lamellae, which suspend the equine distal phalanx from the hoof capsule. Activation of the interleukin-17 (IL-17)-dependent inflammatory pathway is an epidermal stress response that contributes to physiologic cutaneous wound healing as well as pathological skin conditions. To test the hypothesis that IL-17 pathway activation is involved in equine epidermal lamellae in SLL, we analyzed the expression of the IL-17 receptor subunit A and 11 genes upregulated by IL-17 in lamellar tissue isolated from Thoroughbreds euthanized due to naturally occurring SLL and in age and breed matched non-laminitic controls. The IL-17 Receptor A subunit was expressed in both non-laminitic and laminitic tissues. In severe acute SLL (n=7) compared to non-laminitic controls (n=8), quantitative PCR demonstrated [~]20-100 fold upregulation of {beta} defensin 4 (E. caballus gene DEFB4B) and S100A9 genes. DEFB4B was also upregulated in developmental (n=8), moderate acute (n=7), and severe chronic (n=5) samples. By RT-PCR, S100A8, MMP9, and PTSG2 (COX2) expression was upregulated in most or all severe acute SLL samples, whereas several other genes, CCL2, CxCL8, TNF, IL6 and MMP1 were detected in some, but not all, severe acute samples.

Based on synthetic cattle and truck movement data in southwest Kansas, we build a farm-level contact network with two layers, a cattle movement layer (direct contacts) and a truck movement layer (indirect contacts). The S-E-I-R model is selected to describe the epidemiology of the foot-and-mouth disease with some parameters adopted from published literature. For two parameters -- detection time and indirect transmission rate -- we perform a sensitivity analysis. Through a thorough simulation analysis of three sets of scenarios, we compare the disease transmission dynamics, the distribution of outbreak epidemic size, and the disease breakout percentage -- note that for some simulations an initial infection will not produce a disease outbreak -- of different contact structures. Simulation results show that neither direct contact nor indirect contact individually can result in a massive outbreak of the disease, but their combination plays a significant role. Additionally, we detect different probabilities of disease outbreak by starting the simulations at different farms; starting at some farms with high node strength increases the probability of disease outbreak. However, the immunization of the high-risk farms is not enough to control the disease spreading. Whats more, we find that the detection time and indirect transmission rate have great impacts on the epidemic size and disease breakout percentage.","NA"

We have developed an inexpensive, Arduino-based, homecage training apparatus for sensory association training in freely-moving mice using multiwhisker air current stimulation coupled to a water reward. Animals learn this task readily, within 1-2 days of training, and performance progressively improves with training. We examined the parameters that regulate task acquisition using different stimulus intensities, directions, and reward valence. Learning was assessed by comparing anticipatory licking for the stimulus compared to the no-stimulus (blank) trials. At high stimulus intensities (>9 psi), animals showed markedly less participation in the task. Conversely, very weak air current intensities (1-2 psi) were not sufficient to generate rapid learning behavior. At intermediate stimulus intensities (5-6 psi), a majority of mice learned that the multiwhisker stimulus predicted the water reward after 24-48 hrs of training. Both exposure to isoflurane and lack of whiskers decreased animals ability to learn the task. Perceptual learning was assessed and following training at an intermediate stimulus intensity, perception was likely heightened as mice were able to transfer learning behavior when exposed to the lower stimulus intensity. Mice learned to discriminate between two directions of stimulation rapidly and accurately, even when the angular distance between the stimuli was <15 degrees. Switching the reward to a more desirable reward, aspartame, had little effect on learning trajectory. Our results show that a tactile association task in an automated homecage environment can be monitored by anticipatory licking to reveal rapid and progressive behavioral change. These Arduino-based, automated mouse cages enable high-throughput training that facilitate analysis of large numbers of genetically modified mice with targeted manipulations of neural activity.","NA"

We used hyperalgesic priming with interleukin 6 (IL-6) priming and PGE2 as a second stimulus as a model for pain chronicity. Intraplantar IL-6 induced hypersensitivity was similar in magnitude and duration in both males and females, while both paw and intrathecal PGE2 hypersensitivity was more persistent in females. This difference in PGE2 response was dependent on both circulating estrogen and translation regulation signaling in the spinal cord. In males, the duration of hypersensitivity was regulated by testosterone. Since the prolactin receptor (Prlr) is regulated by reproductive hormones and is female-selectively activated in sensory neurons, we evaluated whether Prlr signaling contributes to hyperalgesic priming. Using {Delta}PRL, a competitive Prlr antagonist, and a mouse line with ablated Prlr in the Nav1.8 sensory neuronal population, we show that Prlr in sensory neurons is necessary for the development of hyperalgesic priming in female but not male mice. Overall, sex-specific mechanisms in the initiation and maintenance of chronic pain are regulated by the neuroendocrine system and, specifically, sensory neuronal Prlr signaling.

Significance StatementFemales are more likely to experience chronic pain than males, but the mechanisms that underlie this sexual dimorphism are not completely understood. Here, we demonstrate that the duration of mechanical hypersensitivity is dependent on circulating sex hormones in mice - where estrogen caused an extension of sensitivity and testosterone was responsible for a decrease in the duration of the hyperalgesic priming model of chronic pain.

Targeting to EMT-related molecules is emerging as a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of lung cancer cell migration and invasion. Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) has recently been considered as an anti-proliferative target molecule to regulate the Wnt signaling pathway in several types of cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib and the integrin-V{beta}3 targeted cyclic peptide (cRGDfK) on EMT in human lung cancer cells. Sunitinib strongly inhibited the TGF-{beta}1-activated EMT through suppression of Wnt signaling, Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways. In addition, the cRGDfK also inhibited the expression of TGF{beta}1-induced mesenchymal marker genes and proteins. The anti-EMT effect of sunitinib was enhanced when cRGDfK was treated together. When sunitinib was treated with cRGDfK, the mRNA and protein expression levels of mesenchymal markers were decreased compared to the treatment with sunitinib alone. Co-treatment of cRGDfK has shown the potential to improve the efficacy of anticancer agents in combination with therapeutic agents that may be toxic at high concentrations. These results provide new and improved therapies for treating and preventing EMT-related disorders, such as lung fibrosis and cancer metastasis, and relapse.","NA"

We tested and ranked collapse indicators at the community level (abundance, species richness, constancy, dominance, Shannons H, standard deviation, variance, lag-1 autocorrelation of community abundance, lag-1 autocorrelation of Shannons H) and at the level of the dominant species (total changes of pre-collapse and collapse dominant species, lag-1 autocorrelation of pre-collapse and collapse dominant species) based on their performances. We distinguished between small-scale signals (sharp drops and peaks) and large-scale signals (trend changes). Small-scale signals and large-scale signals can be at the same time, however, small-scale signals can also precede large-scale signals. Small-scale signals indicate environmental events. Large-scale trend changes refer to the decline and eventually the collapse of the community. Our results show that the collapse indicators of the dominant species outperform community-level critical slowing down indicators, which suggests that the dominant species probably have an important role in community-level collapses triggered by environmental events. We also concluded that unusual environmental events might be the number one cause of collapses therefore small-scale signals should be involved in analyses.","NA"

Given the effects of environmental changes (e.g., climate change and human effect) on the diversity of animals and plants, effects on soil bacterial diversity are expected; however, they have been poorly evaluated to date. Thus, in this study, we focused on the soil dominant bacteria because of their global importance and investigated the effects of warming velocity and human activities on their diversity. Using a global dataset of bacteria, we performed spatial analysis to evaluate the effects, while statistically controlling for the potential confounding effects of current climate and geographic parameters with global climate and geographic data. It was demonstrated that the diversity of the dominant soil bacteria was influenced globally by warming velocity (showing significant increases) in addition to aridity index (dryness) and pH. The effects of warming velocity were particularly significant in forests and grasslands. An effect from human activity was also observed, but it was secondary to warming velocity. These findings provide robust evidence, and advance our understanding of the effects of environmental changes (particularly global warming) on soil bacterial diversity at the global scale.","NA"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of forest canopy-layer composition on the structure (cover) and the composition (richness and diversity) of bryophyte communities (mosses and liverworts) in two contrast landscape types (coast and mountain) in southern Patagonia. Three natural Nothofagus forest types (pure deciduous, pure evergreen, and mixed deciduous-evergreen) in two landscapes (coast < 100 m.a.s.l.; mountain > 400 m.a.s.l.) were selected (N = 60 plots). In each forest plot, we established one linear transect (10 m length) to measure bryophyte cover (point-intercept method). The data were evaluated using ANOVAs, Chi-square test and multivariate analyses. The mosses were mostly austral-antarctic origin, and the liverworts were all endemics. The principal substrates for the bryophytes development in the forest floor were litter and decaying woods. Moreover, many bryophytes species act as a substrate for natural tree regeneration. The forest structure was the main driver of bryophytes community in the coast landscape, while the slope was the principal driver of bryophytes in the mountain landscape. These differences were mainly explained for the microclimate into the forests (e.g., soil moisture and air temperature), and for the regional climate in the landscapes (e.g., air temperature and soil conditions). Notably, the mixed forest, mainly in the coast, presented exclusive species that were not present in the deciduous and evergreen pure forests. The conservation efforts should include management considerations both the stand and landscape levels based on the potential climate-change impact over bryophyte communities.","NA"

SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) provides a promising but challenging drug target due to its intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) function. Nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) analogues added to the growing RNA chain should supposedly terminate viral RNA replication, but ExoN can cleave the incorporated compounds and counteract their efficacy. Remdesivir targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp exerts high drug efficacy in vitro and in vivo. However, its underlying inhibitory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 12.6 microseconds to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of remdesivir in nucleotide addition (RdRp complex: nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) and proofreading (ExoN complex: nsp14-nsp10). We found that the 1-cyano group of remdesivir possesses the dual role of inhibiting both nucleotide addition and proofreading. For nucleotide addition, we showed that incorporation of one remdesivir is not sufficient to terminate RNA synthesis. Instead, the presence of the polar 1-cyano group of remdesivir at an upstream site causes instability via its electrostatic interactions with a salt bridge formed by Asp865 and Lys593, rendering translocation unfavourable. This may eventually lead to a delayed chain termination of RNA extension by three nucleotides. For proofreading, remdesivir can inhibit cleavage via the steric clash between the 1-cyano group and Asn104. To further examine the role of 1-cyano group in remdesivirs inhibitory effects, we studied three additional NTP analogues with other types of modifications: favipiravir, vidarabine, and fludarabine. Our simulations suggest that all three of them are prone to ExoN cleavage. Our computational findings were further supported by an in vitro assay in Vero E6 cells using live SARS-CoV-2. The dose-response curves suggest that among tested NTP analogues, only remdesivir exerts significant inhibitory effects on viral replication. Our work provides plausible mechanisms at molecular level on how remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication, and our findings may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","NA"

Specifically, some tinamous lay glossy and colorful eggs while others lay less colorful eggs. Here I tested the hypothesis that tinamou egg coloration is a mating signal and its diversification was driven by reinforcement. For most tinamou species, the male guard the nest that is sequentially visited and laid eggs in by multiple females. The colorations of the existing eggs in the nest could signal mate quality and species identities to the upcoming females to the nest, preventing costly hybridization, thus were selected to diverge among species. If so, egg colors should coevolve with the known mating signals as the tinamou lineages diverged. The tinamou songs are important mating signals and are highly divergent among species. I found that the egg luminance was significantly associated with the first principle component of the song variables among 31 tinamou species (after correcting for phylogenetic signal). Egg color and songs could be multimodal mating signals that are divergently selected as different tinamou species diverged.

Such generality limits the tracking performance and may require exhaustive optimization of parameters. Here, we present Trackosome, a freely available open-source computational tool to track the centrosomes and reconstruct the nuclear and cellular membranes, based on volumetric live-imaging data. The toolbox runs in MATLAB and provides a graphical user interface for easy and efficient access to the tracking and analysis algorithms. It outputs key metrics describing the spatiotemporal relations between centrosomes, nucleus and cellular membrane. Trackosome can also be used to measure the dynamic fluctuations of the nuclear envelope. A fine description of these fluctuations is important because they are correlated with the mechanical forces exerted on the nucleus by its adjacent cytoskeletal structures. Unlike previous algorithms based on circular/elliptical approximations of the nucleus, Trackosome measures membrane movement in a model-free condition, making it viable for irregularly shaped nuclei. Using Trackosome, we demonstrate significant correlations between the movements of the two centrosomes, and identify specific modes of oscillation of the nuclear envelope.

In a forward genetic screen for genes regulating the light sensitivity of the ciliated ASH sensory neurons, we isolated bbs mutants, indicating that BBSome regulates ASH photosensitivity. Surprisingly, cilia are not required for ASH neurons to sense light, suggesting that BBSome regulates ASH photosensitivity independently of cilia. Interestingly, the light-sensing receptor LITE-1, which mediates photosensation, is a non-ciliary protein in ASH neurons. LITE-1 in ASH neurons becomes unstable in bbs mutants in an age-dependent manner, indicating that BBSome regulates the stability of LITE-1 in these neurons.

Age-dependent increased expression of NLRP3 in the ovary was observed in female WT mice during reproductive aging. High expression of NLRP3, caspase 1 and IL-1{beta} was also observed in granulosa cells from patients with primary ovarian insufficiency. Ablation of the NLRP3 inflammasome improved the survival and pregnancy rates in mice, increased hormonal levels of AMH, a biochemical marker of ovarian reserve, and autophagy rates in ovarian tissue. Deficiency of the NLRP3 inflammasome also reduced serum FSH and estradiol levels. Consistent with these results, pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 using a direct NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950, improved fertility in female mice to levels comparable to those of Nlrp3-/- mice. These results suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome is implicated in the age-dependent loss of female fertility and position this inflammasome as a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of infertility.","NA"

A recent resurgence in cultivation efforts has improved the cultivability of fastidious bacteria for hypothesis testing and synthetic community ecology.

The catalytic mechanism of iron oxidation in the ferritin family is still an open question, due to differences in organization of the ferroxidase catalytic site and secondary metal binding sites vicinal to this. We have previously identified a metal binding site on the inner surface of the Rhodospirillum rubrum encapsulated ferritin at the interface between the two-helix subunits and proximal to the ferroxidase center. Here we present a comprehensive structural and functional study to investigate the functional relevance of this proposed iron entry site by means of enzymatic assays, mass-spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography.

To enable CAR T cells to respond to heat, we construct synthetic thermal gene switches that trigger expression of transgenes in response to mild elevations in local temperature (40-42 {degrees}C) but not to orthogonal cellular stresses such as hypoxia. We show that short pulses of heat (15-30 min) lead to more than 60-fold increases in gene expression without affecting key T cell functions including proliferation, migration, and cytotoxicity.

Various computational methods using bulk RNA-seq data have been proposed for breast cancer prognosis. However, these methods suffer from limited performances or ambiguous biological relevance, as a result of the neglect of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Recently, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged for studying tumor heterogeneity at cellular levels. In this paper, we propose a novel method, scPrognosis, to improve breast cancer prognosis with scRNA-seq data. scPrognosis uses the scRNA-seq data of the biological process Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). It firstly infers the EMT pseudotime and a dynamic gene co-expression network, then uses an integrative model to select genes important in EMT based on their expression variation and differentiation in different stages of EMT, and their roles in the dynamic gene co-expression network. To validate and apply the selected signatures to breast cancer prognosis, we use them as the features to build a prediction model with bulk RNA-seq data. The experimental results show that scPrognosis outperforms other benchmark breast cancer prognosis methods that use bulk RNA-seq data. Moreover, the dynamic changes in the expression of the selected signature genes in EMT may provide clues to the link between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. scPrognosis will also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT.

Author summaryVarious computational methods have been developed for breast cancer prognosis. However, those methods mainly use the gene expression data generated by the bulk RNA sequencing techniques, which average the expression level of a gene across different cell types. As breast cancer is a heterogenous disease, the bulk gene expression may not be the ideal resource for cancer prognosis. In this study, we propose a novel method to improve breast cancer prognosis using scRNA-seq data. The proposed method has been applied to the EMT scRNA-seq dataset for identifying breast cancer signatures for prognosis. In comparison with existing bulk expression data based methods in breast cancer prognosis, our method shows a better performance. Our single-cell-based signatures provide clues to the relation between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. In addition, the proposed method can also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT.","NA"

Ferlins represent a protein family with roles in exocytosis containing multiple Ca2+-sensing C2 domains. Here we defined the role of T. gondiis ferlin 1 (FER1) in microneme biology. FER1 localized dynamically to several compartments of the parasites secretory pathway as well as to an apical spot near the site of microneme secretion. FER1 function was dissected by overexpression of a variety of N-terminally tagged alleles causing dominant negative phenotypes. This demonstrated FER1 traffics microneme organelles at several discrete steps of their natural trajectories: 1. from ELC to the subpellicular microtubules; 2. along the subpellicular microtubules to the apical end; 3. into the conoid; 4. and inferred from observed retrograde transport from the subpellicular microtubules, recycling of micronemes from mother to daughter parasites. Furthermore, full-length FER1 overexpression results in a squirt of microneme release sufficient for host cell egress. This indicates FER1 facilitates fusion of the most apical, radially organized micronemes with the plasma membrane. Moreover, FER1 acts differentially on the Rab5A/C-dependent and - independent microneme sub-populations. Finally, apical FER1 overlaps with the presence of VP1, a pyrophosphatase proton pump. Integrating all new insights, we propose a model of microneme exocytosis wherein the radial micronemes constitute a readily releasable vesicle pool primed by acidification.","NA"

Knowledge of potential insertion points from TRIAD libraries formed the basis of exploration of length and sequence diversity of novel insertions by insertional-scanning mutagenesis (ISM). An overall 256-fold affinity improvement of an anti-IL-13 antibody BAK1 as a result of InDel mutagenesis and combination with known point mutations validates this approach and suggests that the results of this InDel approach and conventional exploration of point mutations can synergize to generate antibodies with higher affinity.

However, the presence of D-amino acids and their recruitment in early animals is mostly unknown due to limited information about prebilaterian metazoans. Here, we performed the comparative survey of L-/D-aspartate and L-/D-glutamate in representatives of four phyla of basal Metazoa: cnidarians (Aglantha); placozoans (Trichoplax), sponges (Sycon) and ctenophores (Pleurobrachia, Mnemiopsis, Bolinopsis, and Beroe), which are descendants of ancestral animal lineages distinct from Bilateria. Specifically, we used high-performance capillary electrophoresis for microchemical assays and quantification of the enantiomers. L-glutamate and L-aspartate were abundant analytes in all species studied. However, we showed that the placozoans, cnidarians, and sponges had high micromolar concentrations of D-aspartate, whereas D-glutamate was not detectable. In contrast, we found that in ctenophores, D-glutamate was the dominant enantiomer with no or trace amounts of D-aspartate. This situation illuminates prominent lineage-specific diversifications in the recruitment of D-amino acids and suggests distinct signaling functions of these molecules early in the animal evolution. We also hypothesize that a deep ancestry of such recruitment events might provide some constraints underlying the evolution of neural and other signaling systems in Metazoa.

Graphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY D-amino acids are essential for intercellular signaling. Direct microchemical quantification of enantiomers in representatives of early-branching animals suggests lineage-specific recruitments of D-glutamate and D-aspartate. Deep ancestry of such events might provide some constraints underlying the evolution of neural and other signaling systems in Metazoa.

Deletion of certain ciliary genes in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) mouse models markedly attenuates PKD severity, indicating that a component of cilia dysfunction may have critical therapeutic potential.

MethodWe have ablated the Ift-A gene, Thm1, globally in juvenile and adult mouse models of ADPKD.

ResultsRelative to juvenile Pkd2 conditional knock-out mice, deletion of Thm1 together with Pkd2 resulted in a complex phenotype, with reduced kidney weight/body weight (KW/BW) ratios, reduced cortical collecting duct-derived cysts, but increased proximal tubular and glomerular dilations, and similar blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Additionally, primary cilia of cortical collecting duct epithelia were lengthened in Pkd2 conditional knock-out kidneys, as well as in Pkd2;Thm1 double knock-out kidneys. In contrast, Thm1 deletion in adult ADPKD mouse models markedly reduced multiple disease parameters, including KW/BW ratios, collecting duct- and loop of Henle-derived cysts, proximal tubular dilations, and BUN levels. Further, primary cilia lengths of cortical collecting duct epithelia were increased in Pkd1 and Pkd2 conditional knock-out mice, but similar to control in Pkd1;Thm1 and Pkd2;Thm1 double knock-out mice.

ConclusionsThese data reveal that during kidney development, Thm1 both promotes and inhibits different aspects of ADPKD renal cystogenesis in a tubule-dependent manner; however, during adult kidney homeostasis, Thm1 promotes virtually all features of ADPKD renal cyst growth. These findings suggest that differential factors between tubules and between developing versus mature renal microenvironments influence cilia dysfunction and ADPKD pathobiology.","NA"

We found that the high-pathogenicity island (HPI), a [~]35 kbp gene island encoding the yersiniabactin siderophore, is highly associated with death in mice, surpassing other associated genetic factors also related to iron uptake, such as the aerobactin and the sitABCD operons. We validated the association in vivo by deleting key components of the HPI in E. coli strains in two phylogenetic backgrounds, and found that virulence is correlated in E. coli with growth in the presence of various stressors including several antimicrobials, which hints at collateral sensitivities associated with intrinsic virulence.

P. aeruginosa encodes two heme uptake systems, the heme assimilation system (Has) and the Pseudomonas heme utilization (Phu) system. Extracellular heme is sensed via the Has system that encodes an extra cytoplasmic function (ECF) {sigma} factor system. Previous studies have shown release of heme from the extracellular hemophore HasAp to the outer membrane receptor HasR is required for activation of the {sigma} factor HasI. Herein, employing site-directed mutagenesis, allelic exchange, quantitative PCR analyses, immunoblotting and 13C-heme uptake studies, we characterize the differential contributions of the outer membrane receptor HasR extracellular FRAP/PNPNL loop residue His-624 and the N-terminal plug residue His-221 to heme transport and signaling, respectively. Specifically, we show mutation of the N-terminal plug His-221 disrupts both signaling and transport. The data is consistent with a model where heme release from HasAp to the N-terminal plug of HasR is required to initiate signaling, whereas His624 is required for simultaneously closing off the heme transport channel from the extracellular medium and triggering heme transport. Furthermore, mutation of His-221 leads to dysregulation of both the Has and Phu uptake systems suggesting a possible functional link that is coordinated through the ECF {sigma} factor system.","NA"

With the rise of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections, it is imperative to develop alternative prevention and treatment strategies, such as utilization of lytic bacteriophage as pathogen countermeasures. However, phage-host interactions remain poorly understood, impeding widespread practice. Here, we employed high-throughput, functional analyses to discover the genetic determinants of phage-host interactions between a model enteric Salmonella species, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) and its phages. To rapidly assess genetic contributions to phage sensitivity, we created a 66,996 member randomly barcoded transposon (RB-TnSeq) library in S. typhimurium MS1868. Using this library, we compared fitness across eleven diverse lytic Salmonella phages. Consistent with other loss of function studies against bacteriophage predation, this approach efficiently identified receptors essential to adsorption as well as their regulation. While many of the tested phages bound directly to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) layer, we report a highly resolved view of differential structural LPS layer requirements for diverse Salmonella phages, including novel adsorption strategies. We also uncover unique routes to phage resistance, including phage-specific metabolic requirements, ion flow, and global transcription factor interplay, difficult to find through traditional approaches. constitutes a major challenge and opportunity. We highlight several examples of how the scale of barcoded screens allowed systems-level hypotheses to be efficiently formulated.

By using bioinformatics analyses, phage plating efficiency experiments, microscopy, and immunoprecipitation assays, we show that Butters genes located in the central region of the genome play a key role in the defense against heterotypic viral attack. Our study suggests that a two component system articulated by interactions between protein products of genes 30 and 31 confers defense against heterotypic phage infection by PurpleHaze or Alma, but is insufficient to confer defense against attack by the heterotypic phage Island3. Therefore, based on heterotypic phage plating efficiencies on the Butters lysogen, additional prophage genes required for defense are implicated.

ObjectiveWe analyzed the effects of antibiotics on the nasal microbiome and secreted proteome in the context of CRS using multi-omic analysis.

MethodsNasal secretions were collected from 29 control, 30 CRS patients without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and 40 CRS patients with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). A total of 99 subjects were divided into two groups that included subjects who had taken antibiotics 3 months prior to sampling (ABX) and those who had not (NABX). We performed 16S rDNA sequence analyses and Orbitrap mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses in data-independent acquisition (DIA) on the nasal secretions. Spearman correlation was used to assess the correlations between the nasal microbiome and secreted proteome.

ResultsWe observed a strong association between the nasal microbiome and secreted proteome according to disease status. Antibiotic use reduced differences in the microbial community and secreted proteome according to disease status. Interestingly, in nasal polyp (NP) patients, antibiotics exhibited strong effects not only on the nasal microbiome and the secreted proteome but also on their associations. Additionally, their correlations were strengthened in subjects who had taken antibiotics.

ConclusionIntegrative analyses revealed that the correlations between the microbiome and the secreted proteome could be altered and strengthened in subjects who used antibiotics.

Recent studies revealed that HDL receptor scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI or Scarb1) plays a critical protective role in sepsis. Using Scarb1I179N mice, a mutant SR-BI mouse model with 90% depletion in hepatic SR-BI, we previously reported that the mutant mice are susceptible to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. However, using a hypo-AlbCreSR-BIfl/fl mouse model, Hubys group showed that the liver-specific SR-BI KO mice are not more susceptible to CLP-induced sepsis. In this study, we generated a new floxed SR-BI mouse model to clarify the contribution of hepatic SR-BI in sepsis. SR-BI is known as a receptor that plays a key role in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) by uptaking cholesterol to the liver. So, our established AlbCreSR-BIfl/fl mice (liver-specific SR-BI KO) is an RCT deficiency mice model that can be used to understand the mechanisms of RCT protecting against sepsis and may provide new insight into the pathogenesis of sepsis.

Methods and ResultsWe generated SR-BIfl/fl mice by flanking exon 2. We bred the floxed mice with AlbCre mice to generate AlbCreSR-BIfl/fl mice (liver-specific SR-BI KO mice), then the mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for 10 generations. As shown in Fig 1, the liver SR-BI expression was normal in SR-BIfl/fl mice as compared to C57BL/6J (B6) mice, but completely depleted in AlbCreSR-BIfl/fl mice. Using this liver-specific SR-BI KO model, we observed that a deficiency in RCT rendered the mice highly susceptible to CLP-induced sepsis as shown by 80% and 14.3% survival of SR-BIfl/fl and AlbCreSR-BIfl/fl mice, respectively. We found aggravated inflammatory cytokine production, altered leukocyte recruitment and slightly increased in the blood and peritoneal bacteria. Moreover, we found RCT deficiency mice increased both free and total cholesterol levels in serum and showed severer hemolysis in AlbCreSR-BIfl/fl mice than SR-BIfl/fl mice during CLP-induced sepsis. Importantly, when we fed AlbCreSR-BIfl/fl mice with probucol to decrease the cholesterol level in serum before performing CLP, the survival rate of AlbCreSR-BIfl/fl mice improved to 88.9%.

The RP is classically thought to be specific to internally-driven decisions to act, and to reflect post-decision motor preparation. Recent work suggests instead that it may reflect noise or conflict during the decision itself, with internally-driven decisions tending to be more random, more conflictual and thus more uncertain than externally-driven actions. To contrast accounts based on endogenicity with accounts based on uncertainty, we recorded EEG in a task where participants decided to act or withhold action to accept or reject visually-presented gambles, and used multivariate methods to extract an RP-like component.. We found no difference in amplitude of this component between actions driven by strong versus weak evidence, suggesting that the RP may not reflect uncertainty. In contrast, the same RP-like component showed higher amplitudes prior to actions performed without any external evidence (guesses) than for actions performed in response to equivocal, conflicting evidence. This supports the view that the RP reflects the internal source of action, rather than decision uncertainty.

Significance StatementThe EEG Readiness Potential (RP) seen prior to self-initiated actions is often taken as a neural marker of volition (Shibasaki & Hallett, 2006). It has been argued that the RP may instead reflect conflict and uncertainty in the decisions leading up to these actions, raising questions about decades of previous findings. We directly tested these explanations by asking participants to decide whether to act or not in a gambling task, while manipulating both uncertainty and the source of the information (internal or external) guiding the decision. Only the source of information affected the presence of the RP. Therefore, the RP remains a marker of internally-generated voluntary action, not a marker of uncertainty.","NA"

Although overexcitation of neurons can facilitate disease progression, the induction of cortical gamma oscillations can reduce amyloid load and improve cognitive functions in mouse models. These beneficial effects of gamma oscillations can be caused by either optogenetic activation of cortical parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons or 40 Hz repetitive sensory stimuli. However, given the fact that cortical gamma oscillations can be induced by multiple mechanisms, it is still unclear whether other approaches to induce gamma oscillations can also be beneficial. Here we show that optogenetic activation of PV+ neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) increases amyloid burden, rather than reducing it. We applied 40 Hz optical stimulation in the BF of 5xFAD mice by expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in PV+ neurons. After one-hour induction of cortical gamma oscillations over three days, we observed the increase in the concentration of amyloid-{beta}42 in the frontal cortical region, but not amyloid-{beta}40. The density of amyloid plaques also increased in the medial prefrontal cortex and the septal nuclei, both of which are targets of BF PV+ neurons. These results suggest that effects of cortical gamma oscillations on Alzheimers disease pathology can be bidirectional depending on their induction mechanisms.

Significance StatementAlzheimers disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Although numerous molecular targets have been identified, the development of treatment is still a challenge. Accumulating evidence shows that artificial control of neuronal activity can modify AD pathology. In particular, the induction of cortical gamma (~40 Hz) oscillations can ameliorate AD pathology and improve cognitive functions. Here we show that optogenetic activation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) has opposite effects. By expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in PV+ neurons of an AD mouse model and optically stimulating BF PV+ neurons, we induced gamma oscillations and found increased amyloid burden.

Accordingly, the measurements constituting the dataset are not independent, even though the traditional statistical analyses often applied in such cases (e.g. Students t-test) treat them as such. The hierarchical bootstrap has been shown to be an effective tool to accurately analyze such data and while it has been used extensively in the statistical literature, its use is not widespread in neuroscience - despite the ubiquity of hierarchical datasets. In this paper, we illustrate the intuitiveness and utility of this approach to analyze hierarchically nested datasets. We use simulated neural data to show that traditional statistical tests can result in a false positive rate of over 45%, even if the Type-I error rate is set at 5%. While summarizing data across non-independent points (or lower levels) can potentially fix this problem, this approach greatly reduces the statistical power of the analysis. The hierarchical bootstrap, when applied sequentially over the levels of the hierarchical structure, keeps the Type-I error rate within the intended bound and retains more statistical power than summarizing methods.

The model describes place cell firing as the successor features of the SR, with grid cells forming a low-dimensional representation of these successor features. We show that the place and grid cells generated using the BVC-SR model provide a good account of biological data for a variety of environmental manipulations, including dimensional stretches, barrier insertions, and the influence of environmental geometry on the hippocampal representation of space.","NA"

Strong coupling between LC spiking and depolarizing phase of slow (1 - 2 Hz) waves in the PFC field potentials during sleep and anesthesia suggests that the LC drives cortical state transition. Reciprocal LC-PFC connectivity should also allow interactions in the opposing (top-down) direction, but prior work has only studied prefrontal control over LC activity using direct electrical (or optogenetic) stimulation paradigms. Here, we describe the physiological characteristics of naturally occurring top-down prefrontal-coerulear interactions. Specifically, we recorded LC multi-unit activity (MUA) simultaneously with PFC single unit and local field potential (LFP) activity in urethane-anesthetized rats. We observed cross-regional coupling between the phase of ~5 Hz oscillations in LC population spike rate and the power of PFC LFP oscillations within the high Gamma (hGamma) range (60 - 200 Hz). Specifically, transient increases in PFC hGamma power preceded peaks in the ~5 Hz LC-MUA oscillation. Analysis of cross-regional transfer entropy demonstrated that the PFC hGamma transients were predictive of a transient increase in LC-MUA. A ~29 msec delay between these signals was consistent with the conduction velocity from the PFC to the LC. Finally, we showed that PFC hGamma transients are associated with synchronized spiking of a subset (27%) of PFC single units. Our data suggest that, PFC hGamma transients may indicate the timing of the top-down excitatory input to LC, at least under conditions when LC neuronal population activity fluctuates rhythmically at ~5 Hz. Synchronized PFC neuronal spiking that occurs during hGamma transients may provide a previously unknown mode of top-down control over the LC.","NA"

A3R antagonists have been described as potential treatments for numerous diseases including asthma. Given the similarity between ARs orthosteric binding sites, obtaining highly selective antagonists is a challenging but critical task.

Experimental approach39 potential A3R, antagonists were screened using agonist-induced inhibition of cAMP. Positive hits were assessed for AR subtype selectivity through cAMP accumulation assays. The antagonist affinity was determined using Schild analysis (pA2 values) and fluorescent ligand binding. Further, a likely binding pose of the most potent antagonist (K18) was determined through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and consistent calculated binding free energy differences between K18 and congeners, using a homology model of A3R, combined with mutagenesis studies.

Key ResultsWe demonstrate that K18, which contains a 3-(dichlorophenyl)-isoxazole group connected through carbonyloxycarboximidamide fragment with a 1,3-thiazole ring, is a specific A3R (<1 {micro}M) competitive antagonist. Structure-activity relationship investigations revealed that loss of the 3-(dichlorophenyl)-isoxazole group significantly attenuated K18 antagonistic potency. Mutagenic studies supported by MD simulations identified the residues important for binding in the A3R orthosteric site. Finally, we introduce a model that enables estimates of the equilibrium binding affinity for rapidly disassociating compounds from real-time fluorescent ligand-binding studies.

Conclusions and ImplicationsThese results demonstrate the pharmacological characterisation of a selective competitive A3R antagonist and the description of its orthosteric binding mode. Our findings may provide new insight for drug discovery.

K.; Moher, D.","Jamie J Kirkham","University of Manchester","2020-04-28",1,"cc_by","new results","scientific communication and education","ObjectivesThe objective of this review is to identify all preprint platforms with biomedical and medical scope and to compare and contrast the key characteristics and policies of these platforms. We also aim to provide a searchable database to enable relevant stakeholders to compare between platforms.

Study Design and SettingPreprint platforms that were launched up to 25th June 2019 and have a biomedical and medical scope according to MEDLINEs journal selection criteria were identified using existing lists, web-based searches and the expertise of both academic and non-academic publication scientists. A data extraction form was developed, pilot-tested and used to collect data from each preprint platforms webpage(s). Data collected were in relation to scope and ownership; content-specific characteristics and information relating to submission, journal transfer options, and external discoverability; screening, moderation, and permanence of content; usage metrics and metadata. Where possible, all online data were verified by the platform owner or representative by correspondence.

ResultsA total of 44 preprint platforms were identified as having biomedical and medical scope, 17 (39%) were hosted by the Open Science Framework preprint infrastructure, six (14%) were provided by F1000 Research Ltd (the Open Research Central infrastructure) and 21 (48%) were other independent preprint platforms. Preprint platforms were either owned by non-profit academic groups, scientific societies or funding organisations (n=28; 64%), owned/partly owned by for-profit publishers or companies (n=14; 32%) or owned by individuals/small communities (n=2; 5%). Twenty-four (55%) preprint platforms accepted content from all scientific fields although some of these had restrictions relating to funding source, geographical region or an affiliated journals remit. Thirty-three (75%) preprint platforms provided details about article screening (basic checks) and 14 (32%) of these actively involved researchers with context expertise in the screening process. The three most common screening checks related to the scope of the article, plagiarism and legal/ethical/societal issues and compliance. Almost all preprint platforms allow submission to any peer-reviewed journal following publication, have a preservation plan for read-access, and most have a policy regarding reasons for retraction and the sustainability of the service. Forty-one (93%) platforms currently have usage metrics, with the most common metric being the number of downloads presented on the abstract page.

ConclusionA large number of preprint platforms exist for use in biomedical and medical sciences, all of which offer researchers an opportunity to rapidly disseminate their research findings onto an open-access public server, subject to scope and eligibility. However, the process by which content is screened before online posting and withdrawn or removed after posting varies between platforms, which may be associated with platform operation, ownership, governance and financing.

What is already known on this topicO_LIIn concurrence with an increase in the number of preprint servers and platforms supporting biomedical and medical sciences research since 2013, there has been substantial growth in the number of preprints posted in this research area.
C_LIO_LIThe significant benefits of accelerated dissemination of research that preprints offer has attracted the support of many major funders.
C_LIO_LIThe raised profile of preprints has led to their wider acceptance in institutional and individual level assessment.
C_LI

What this study addsO_LIThis is the first full examination of the characteristics and policies of 44 preprint platforms with biomedical and medical scope. We use a robust methodological approach to extract relevant information from web-based material with input from preprint platform owners.
C_LIO_LIDespite concerns regarding the permanence and quality of preprints, most preprint platforms have long-term preservation strategies and many have screening checks (for example, a basic check for the relevance of content) in place. For some platforms, these checks are performed by researchers with content expertise.
C_LIO_LIWe provide a searchable database as a valuable resource for researchers, funders and policymakers in the biomedical and medical science field to determine which preprint platforms are relevant to their research scope and which have the functionality and policies that they value most.

The proposed approach allows one to directly predict how changes in omics experiments change cell or tissue function. We further demonstrated how this new approach can be used to leverage the metabolic functions of biological entities from the single cell to their organization in tissues and organs using multiple transcriptomic datasets (human and mouse).

Proofreading mechanisms must balance their demand for higher speed, fewer errors, and lower dissipation, but it is unclear how rates of individual reaction steps are evolutionary tuned to balance these needs, especially when multiple proofreading mechanisms are present. Here, using a discrete-state stochastic model, we analyze the optimization strategies in Escherichia coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. Surprisingly, this enzyme adopts an economic proofreading strategy and improves speed and dissipation as long as the error is tolerable. Through global parameter sampling, we reveal a fundamental dissipation-error relation that bounds the enzymes optimal performance and explains the importance of the post-transfer editing mechanism. The proximity of native system parameters to this bound demonstrates the importance of energy dissipation as an evolutionary force affecting fitness.

We develop a particle filter for such processes, using way-points to reduce the problem to the discrete-time case, and generalising the Auxiliary Particle Filter for discrete-time models. We use Variational Bayes for parameter inference to model the uncertainty in parameter estimates for rare events, avoiding biases seen with Expectation Maximization.

Previous studies have identified numerous genomic regions showing consistent genetic differentiation between freshwater and marine ecotypes, but these are typically based on limited geographic sampling and are biased towards studies in the Eastern Pacific. We analysed population genomic data from marine and freshwater ecotypes of three-spined sticklebacks with from a comprehensive global collection of marine and freshwater ecotypes to detect loci involved in parallel evolution at different geographic scales. Our findings highlight that most signatures of parallel evolution were unique to the Eastern Pacific. Trans-oceanic marine and freshwater differentiation was only found in a very limited number of genomic regions, including three chromosomal inversions. Using both simulations and empirical data, we demonstrate that this is likely due to both the stochastic loss of freshwater-adapted alleles during founder events during the invasion of the Atlantic basin and selection against freshwater-adapted variants in the sea, both of which have reduced the amount of standing genetic variation available for freshwater adaptation outside the Eastern Pacific region. Moreover, the existence of highly elevated linkage disequilibrium associated with marine-freshwater differentiation in the Eastern Pacific is also consistent with a secondary contact scenario between marine and freshwater populations that have evolved in isolation from each other during past glacial periods. Thus, contrary to what earlier studies focused on Eastern Pacific populations have led us to believe, parallel marine-freshwater differentiation in sticklebacks is far less prevalent and pronounced in all other parts of the species global distribution range.","NA"

Bacterial adaptations for swarming can include cell elongation, hyper-flagellation, recruitment of special stator proteins and surfactant secretion, among others. We recently demonstrated another swarming adaptation in Escherichia coli, wherein the chemotaxis pathway is remodeled to increase run durations (decrease tumble bias), with running speeds increased as well. We show here that the modification of motility parameters during swarming is not unique to E. coli, but shared by a diverse group of bacteria we examined - Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella enterica, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - suggesting that altering the chemosensory physiology is a cornerstone of swarming.

ImportanceBacteria within a swarm move characteristically in packs, displaying an intricate swirling motion where hundreds of dynamic packs continuously form and dissociate as the swarm colonizes increasing expanse of territory. The demonstrated property of E. coli to reduce its tumble bias and hence increase its run duration during swarming is expected to maintain/promote side-by-side alignment and cohesion within the bacterial packs. Here we observe a similar low tumble bias in five different bacterial species, both Gram positive and Gram negative, each inhabiting a unique habitat and posing unique problems to our health. The unanimous display of an altered run-tumble bias in swarms of all species examined here suggests that this behavioral adaptation is crucial for swarming.","NA"

They protect the cell against both abiotic and biotic stresses such as bacteriophages and the host immune system. Yet, it is unclear if capsules contribute to fitness in the absence of external aggressions, in spite of the cost of production. Here, we enquire if there are conditions favouring the presence of the capsule in Klebsiella, where it is a major virulence factor. We allowed independent populations of 19 different strains, representing six different capsule serotypes, to evolve for twenty generations in different growth media. We observed that capsules were maintained in nutrient-poor media but were selected against in nutrient-rich media. Competitions with capsule mutants in nine different strains showed that capsules provide ca 20% of fitness advantage in nutrient poor-conditions. This is not caused by differences in maximal growth rate, nor death rates. We showed that most capsulated populations reached higher yields. We further characterized how growth conditions affected the role of the capsule during pathogenensis and whether this is conserved across Klebsiella strains. Our data reveals that the environment and the serotype strongly influences major virulence traits such as hypermucoviscosity and biofilm formation. Our data shows that the capsule can be selected for in situations lacking abiotic, but also biotic stresses. This raises the possibility that the forces selecting for the presence of a capsule are different from the ones selecting for rapid serotype variation.

IMPORTANCEBacterial capsules are a wide-spread virulence factor that limits efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. Whereas most studies focus on the role of the capsule in pathogenesis, very few have addressed the conditions under which the capsule is primarily selected for. Here, we show that small changes in growth media have a strong impact in the maintenance of the capsule and the fitness advantage they confer. Our results suggest that the forces selecting for the capsule may be different from those selecting for its composition diversification, namely the immune system and phage predation. Our results further support that the role of the capsule in virulence may be a by-product of adaptation, hinting that there may be other functionalities yet to be discovered for it.","NA"

When no visual cues about weight are available, force planning relies on recent lifting experience. Recently, we showed that previously lifted objects also affect weight estimation, as objects are perceived to be lighter when lifted after heavy objects compared to light ones. Here, we investigated the underlying neural mechanisms mediating these effects. We asked participants to lift objects and estimate their weight. Simultaneously, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during the dynamic loading or static holding phase. Two subject groups received TMS of either the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) or lateral occipital area (LO), known to be important nodes in object grasping and perception. We hypothesized that TMS-induced disruption of aIPS and LO would alter force scaling and weight perception. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find effects of aIPS or LO stimulation on force planning or weight estimation caused by previous lifting experience. However, we found that TMS of both areas increased grip forces, but only when applied during dynamic loading, and decreased weight estimation, but only when applied during static holding, suggesting time-specific effects. Interestingly, our results also indicate that TMS over LO, but not aIPS, affected load force scaling specifically for heavy objects, which further indicates that planning of load and grip forces might be controlled differently. These findings provide new insights on the interactions between brain networks mediating action and perception during object manipulation.

NEW & NOTEWORTHYThis article provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying object lifting and perception. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation during object lifting, we show that effects of previous experience on force scaling and weight perception are not mediated by the anterior intraparietal sulcus nor the lateral occipital cortex (LO). In contrast, we highlight a unique role for LO in load force scaling, suggesting different brain processes for grip and load force scaling in object manipulation.","NA"

These intrinsic clocks allow stable anticipations to light-dark (diel) cycles. Many genes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana are regulated by diel cycles via pathways independent of the clock, suggesting that the integration of circadian and light signals is important for the fitness of plants. Previous studies of light-clock signal integrations have focused on moderate phase adjustment of the two signals. However, dynamical features of integrations across a broad range of phases remain elusive. We recently found that phosphorylation of RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN OF THE SMALL SUBUNIT 6 (RPS6 or eS6), a ubiquitous post-translational modification across kingdoms, is influenced by the circadian clock and the light-dark (diel) cycle in an opposite manner. In order to understand this striking phenomenon and its underlying information processing capabilities, we built a mathematical model for the eS6-P control circuit. We found that the dynamics of eS6-P can be explained by a feedforward circuit with inputs from both circadian and diel cycles. Furthermore, the early-day response of this circuit with dual rhythmic inputs is sensitive to the changes in daylength, including both transient and gradual changes observed in realistic light intervals across a year, due to weather and seasons. By analyzing published gene expression data, we found that the dynamics produced by the eS6-P control circuit can be observed in the expression profiles of a large number of genes. Our work provides mechanistic insights into the complex dynamics of a ribosomal protein, and it proposes a previously underappreciated function of the circadian clock which not only prepares organisms for normal diel cycles but also helps to detect both transient and seasonal changes with a predictive power.

Statement of SignificanceCircadian clocks provide rhythmic dynamics that anticipate light-dark cycles in a consistent fashion. Many genes in plants are controlled by both the circadian clock and light-dark cycles through independent pathways. We built a mathematical model to understand a recent observation that circadian rhythms and light-dark cycles drive the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein eS6 with opposing phases. We found that this phenomenon is governed by a feedforward circuit involving clock and light-dark cycles. With realistic photoperiod data, we show that the circuit can detect both transient (weather) and long-term (seasonal) daylength variations at the beginning of a day, suggesting rich dynamics arising from clock-light signal integration and a new property of the circadian clock in robustly detecting changes in light conditions.","NA"

Formation of T cell-bounded hypoxic granuloma is a host immune defence for containing infected Mtb-macrophages. Our study exploits the mechanistic pathway of Mtb-induced HIF1A silencing by the antisense lncRNA-HIF1A-AS2 in T cells. Computational analysis of in-vitro T-cell stimulation assays in progressors (n=119) versus non-progressor (n=221) tuberculosis patients revealed the role of lncRNA mediated disruption of hypoxia adaptation pathways in progressors. We found 291 upregulated and 227 downregulated DE lncRNAs that were correlated at mRNA level with HIF1A and HILPDA which are major players in hypoxia response. We also report novel lncRNA-AC010655 (AC010655.4 and AC010655.2) in cis with HILPDA, both of which contain binding sites for the BARX2 transcription factor, thus indicating a mechanistic role. Detailed comparison of infection with antigenic stimulation showed a non-random enrichment of lncRNAs in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell in TB progressors. The lack of this pattern in non-progressors replicates indicates the hijacking of the lncRNA dynamics by Mtb. The in-vitro manifestation of this response in the absence of granuloma indicates pre-programmed host-pathogen interaction between T-cells and Mtb regulated through lncRNAs, thus tipping this balance towards progression or containment of Mtb. Finally, we trained multiple machine learning classifiers for reliable prediction of latent to the active progression of patients, yielding a model to guide aggressive treatment.","NA"

A genome-wide screen now revealed that Art2/Ecm21, a member of the -arrestin family of Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase adaptors, is required for the simultaneous endocytosis of four AATs and induced during starvation by the general amino acid control pathway. Art2 uses a basic patch to recognize C-terminal acidic sorting motifs in these AATs and instructs Rsp5 to ubiquitinate proximal lysine residues. In response to amino acid excess, Rsp5 instead uses TORC1-activated Art1 to detect N-terminal acidic sorting motifs within the same AATs, which initiates exclusive substrate-induced endocytosis of individual AATs. Thus, amino acid availability activates complementary -arrestin-Rsp5-complexes to control selective endocytosis for nutrient acquisition.","NA"

Mitochondrial nucleoids exhibit morphological features, coarsening behavior, and dynamics of phase-separated structures in vitro and in vivo. The major mtDNA-binding protein TFAM spontaneously phase separates in vitro into viscoelastic droplets with slow internal dynamics, and the combination of TFAM and mtDNA is sufficient to promote the in vitro formation of multiphase structures with gel-like properties, which recapitulate the in vivo behavior of mitochondrial nucleoids in live human cells. Altered mitochondrial nucleoid structure in HGPS is accompanied by local enrichment of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) markers and mitochondrial dysfunction.

The low heritable genetic variation observed in self-fertilising populations has led to the hypothesis that species with this mating system would be less likely to adapt. However, a non-negligible amount of cryptic genetic variation for polygenic traits, accumulated through negative linkage disequilibrium, could prove to be an important source of standing variation in self-fertilising species. To test this hypothesis we simulated populations under stabilizing selection subjected to an environmental change. We demonstrate that, when the mutation rate is high (but realistic), selfing populations are better able to store genetic variance than outcrossing populations through genetic associations, notably due to the reduced effective recombination rate associated with predominant selfing. Following an environmental shift, this diversity can be partially remobilized, which increases the additive variance and adaptive potential of predominantly (but not completely) selfing populations. In such conditions, despite initially lower observed genetic variance, selfing populations adapt as readily as outcrossing ones within a few generations. For low mutation rates, purifying selection impedes the storage of diversity through genetic associations, in which case, as previously predicted, the lower genetic variance of selfing populations results in lower adaptability compared to their outcrossing counterparts. The population size and the mutation rate are the main parameters to consider, as they are the best predictors of the amount of stored diversity in selfing populations. Our results and their impact on our knowledge of adaptation under high selfing rates are discussed.","NA"

Malassezia are the most abundant fungal skin inhabitant of warm-blooded animals, and have been implicated in skin diseases and systemic disorders, including Crohns disease and pancreatic cancer. Flavohemoglobin is a key enzyme involved in microbial nitrosative stress resistance and nitric oxide degradation. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses within the Malassezia genus revealed that flavohemoglobin-encoding genes were acquired through independent horizontal gene transfer events from different donor bacteria that are part of the mammalian microbiome. Through targeted gene deletion and functional complementation in M. sympodialis, we demonstrated that bacterially-derived flavohemoglobins are cytoplasmic proteins required for nitric oxide detoxification and nitrosative stress resistance under aerobic conditions. RNAseq analysis revealed that endogenous accumulation of nitric oxide resulted in upregulation of genes involved in stress response, and downregulation of the MalaS7 allergen-encoding genes. Solution of the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of Malassezia flavohemoglobin revealed features conserved with both bacterial and fungal flavohemoglobins. In vivo pathogenesis is independent of Malassezia flavohemoglobin. Lastly, we identified additional 30 genus- and species-specific horizontal gene transfer candidates that might have contributed to the evolution of this genus as the most common inhabitants of animal skin.

Affected fish showed darkening, erratic swimming and abdominal distension with associated ascites. Histopathological observations of tissues taken from moribund fish at different farms revealed lesions indicative of viral infection. These included haematopoietic cell nuclear and cytoplasmic pleomorphism with marginalisation of chromatin and fine granulation. Transmission electron microscopy showed cells contained conspicuous virions with typical Iridovirus morphology i.e. enveloped, with icosahedral and or polyhedral geometries and with a diameter c.160 nm. PCR confirmation and DNA sequencing identified the virions as Infectious Spleen and Kidney Necrosis Virus (ISKNV). Samples of fry and older animals were all strongly positive for the presence of the virus by qPCR. All samples tested negative for TiLV and Nodavirus by qPCR. All samples collected from farms prior to the mortality event were negative for ISKNV. Follow up testing of fish and fry sampled from 5 additional sites in July 2019 showed all farms had fish that were PCR positive for ISKNV, whether there was active disease on the farm or not, demonstrating the disease was endemic to farms all over Lake Volta by that point. The results suggest that ISKNV was the cause of disease on the investigated farms and likely had a primary role in the mortality events.

How does the dynamics of balanced networks change under different plasticity rules? How does correlated spiking activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of weights, their eventual magnitude, and structure across the network? To address these questions, we develop a general theory of plasticity in balanced networks. We show that balance can be attained and maintained under plasticity induced weight changes. We find that correlations in the input mildly, but significantly affect the evolution of synaptic weights. Under certain plasticity rules, we find an emergence of correlations between firing rates and synaptic weights. Under these rules, synaptic weights converge to a stable manifold in weight space with their final configuration dependent on the initial state of the network.

In BriefYang et al. report abnormal synaptic reorganization in an epileptogenesis zone in a mouse model of cortical malformation. The authors further demonstrate that spontaneous spike-wave discharges can be curbed by selectively activating somatostatin interneurons using close-loop fiber optogenetic stimulation to a small cortical region away from the microgyrus.

SummaryHow aberrant neural circuits contribute to chronic epilepsy remains unclear. Using a mouse model of focal cortical malformation with spontaneous seizures, we dissected the circuit mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis. Spontaneous and optogenetically induced hyperexcitable bursts in vivo were present in a cortical region distal to (> 1mm) freeze-lesion induced microgyrus, instead of a region near it. ChR2-assisted circuit mapping revealed ectopic interlaminar excitatory inputs from infragranular layers to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons as a key component of the hyperexcitable circuitry. This disrupted balance between excitation and inhibition was prominent in the cortical region distal to the microgyrus. Consistently, the synapses of both parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV) and somatostatin-positive interneurons (SOM) to pyramidal neurons were maladaptive in a layer- and site-specific fashion. Finally, closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of SOM, but not PV, terminated spontaneous spike-wave discharges. Together, these results demonstrate highly site- and cell-type specific synaptic reorganization underlying chronic cortical epilepsy and provide insights into potential treatment strategies for this devastating neurological disorder.","NA"

The assembly and stabilization of previously described tSJ components Anakonda (Aka) and Gliotactin (Gli) as well as the newly reported tSJ proteolipid protein M6, is shown to be a complex process. Aka and M6, whose localization is interdependent, act upstream to locate Gli. In turn, Gli stabilizes Aka at tSJ. Those results unravel a previous unknown role of M6 at tSJ and a tight interplay between tSJ components to assemble and maintain tSJs. In addition, tSJ components are not only essential at vertex as we found that loss of tSJ integrity also induces micron-length bicellular SJs deformations that are free of tensile forces. This phenotype is associated with the disappearance of SJ components at tricellular contacts, indicating that bSJ are no longer connected to tSJs. Reciprocally, SJ components are in turn required to restrict the localization of Aka and Gli at vertex. We propose that tSJs function as pillars to anchor bSJs to ensure the maintenance of tissue integrity in Drosophila proliferative epithelia.","NA"

ResultsAlterations in methylation states previously implicated in prostate cancer progression were observed and patients that maintained methylation changes throughout therapy tended to have a longer time to clinical progression (TTP). Importantly, we also report that markers associated with a highly aggressive form of the disease, Neuroendocrine-CRPC, were associated with a faster TTP.

Safety concerns associated with field data collection during floods have largely hindered advances in assessing flow refugia for fishes; however, spring-fed streams can be safely surveyed during rainfall events owing to their stable flow regimes. In this study, we assessed temporal changes in fish assemblages in a lowland, spring-fed tributary in northern Japan after a 48.5 mm rainfall event. A total of seven fish species were collected, and responses to the flood varied among species. Abundance of salmonids (Oncorhynchus keta and O. masou masou) increased immediately after rainfall but subsequently decreased. Collections of O. keta consisted entirely of mature individuals, while O. masou masou collections included only juveniles, suggesting that the former uses the tributary for spawning whereas O. masou masou may evacuate into the tributary during rainfall events. Benthic species (Cottus hangiongensis and Gymnogobius opperiens) were only observed in the main stream under ordinary flow conditions, and did not appear in the tributary during the flood, suggesting that other flow refugia are available to these species. Our results suggest that spring-fed tributaries may provide flow refugia for nekton species, whereas substrate preferences may be the major determinant of whether spring-fed tributaries function as flow refugia for benthic species.","NA"

Commonly, such forecasts are made based on conservation status assessments produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, when researchers apply these IUCN conservation status data for predicting future extinctions, important information is often omitted, which can impact the accuracy of these predictions.

Here we present a new approach and a software for simulating future extinctions based on IUCN conservation status information, which incorporates generation length information of individual species when modeling extinction risks. Additionally, we explicitly model future changes in conservation status for each species, based on status transition rates that we estimate from the IUCN assessment history of the last decades. Finally, we apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate extinction rates for each species, based on the simulated future extinctions. These estimates inherently incorporate the chances of conservation status changes and the generation length for each given species and are specific to the simulated time frame.

We demonstrate the utility of our approach by estimating extinction rates for all bird species. Our average extinction risk estimate for the next 100 years across all birds is 6.98 x 10-4 extinctions per species-year, and we predict an expected biodiversity loss of between 669 to 738 bird species within that time frame. Further, the rate estimates between species sharing the same IUCN status show larger variation than the rates estimated with alternative approaches, which reflects expected differences in extinction risk among taxa of the same conservation status. Our method demonstrates the utility of applying species-specific information to the estimation of extinction rates, rather than assuming equal extinction risks for species assigned to the same conservation status.","NA"

In this study, we aimed to leverage this shared germline genetics to improve the power of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to identify candidate breast cancer and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes. We built gene expression prediction models using the PrediXcan method in 681 breast and 295 ovarian tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 211 breast and 99 ovarian normal tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project and integrated these with GWAS meta-analysis data from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (122,977 cases/105,974 controls) and the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (22,406 cases/40,941 controls). The integration was achieved through novel application of a pleiotropy-guided conditional/conjunction false discovery rate approach for the first time in the setting of a TWAS. This identified 14 new candidate breast cancer susceptibility genes spanning 11 genomic regions and 8 new candidate ovarian cancer susceptibility genes spanning 5 genomic regions at conjunction FDR < 0.05 that were > 1 Mb away from known breast and/or ovarian cancer susceptibility loci. We also identified 38 candidate breast cancer susceptibility genes and 17 candidate ovarian cancer susceptibility genes at conjunction FDR < 0.05 at known breast and/or ovarian susceptibility loci. Overlaying candidate causal risk variants identified by GWAS fine mapping onto expression prediction models for genes at known loci suggested that the association for 55% of these genes was driven by the underlying GWAS signal.

However, whether prokaryotic organelles emerged early or late in evolutionary history remains unclear and limits understanding of the nature and cellular complexity of early life. Biomineralization of magnetic nanoparticles within magnetosomes by magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) is a fascinating example of prokaryotic organelles. Here, we reconstruct 168 metagenome-assembled MTB genomes from various aquatic environments and waterlogged soils. These genomes represent nearly a 3-fold increase over the number currently available, and more than double the known MTB species. Phylogenomic analysis reveals that these newly described genomes belong to 13 Bacterial phyla, six of which were previously not known to include MTB. These findings indicate a much wider taxonomic distribution of magnetosome organelle biogenesis across the domain Bacteria than previously thought. Comparative genome analysis reveals a vast diversity of magnetosome gene clusters involved in magnetosomal biogenesis in terms of gene content and synteny residing in distinct taxonomic lineages. These gene clusters therefore represent a promising, diverse genetic resource for biosynthesizing novel magnetic nanoparticles. Finally, our phylogenetic analyses of the core magnetosome proteins in this largest available and taxonomically diverse dataset support an unexpectedly early evolutionary origin of magnetosome biomineralization, likely ancestral to the origin of the domain Bacteria.

We show that TANV16L is able to bind to a range of peptides spanning the BH3 motif of human pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, and is able to counter growth arrest of yeast induced by human Bak and Bax. We then determined the crystal structures of TANV16L bound to three identified interactors, Bax, Bim and Puma BH3. TANV16L adopts a globular Bcl-2 fold comprising 7 -helices, and utilizes the canonical Bcl-2 binding groove to engage pro-apoptotic host cell Bcl-2 proteins. Unexpectedly, TANV16L is able to adopt both a monomeric as well as a domain-swapped dimeric topology where the 1 helix from one protomer is swapped into a neighbouring unit. Despite adopting two different oligomeric forms, the canonical ligand binding groove in TANV16L remains unchanged from monomer to domain-swapped dimer. Our results provide a structural and mechanistic basis for tanapoxvirus mediated inhibition of host cell apoptosis, and reveal the capacity of Bcl-2 proteins to adopt differential oligomeric states whilst maintaining the canonical ligand binding groove in an unchanged state.","NA"

Host-targeting drugs are of particular interest because they can offer a high barrier to resistance. Here we report identification of two related small molecules that inhibit HIV-1 late events, a stage of the HIV-1 life cycle for which potent and specific inhibitors are lacking. This chemotype was discovered using cell-free protein synthesis and assembly systems that recapitulate intracellular host-catalyzed viral capsid assembly pathways. These compounds inhibit replication of HIV-1 in human T cell lines and PBMCs and are effective against a primary isolate. They reduce virus production, likely by inhibiting a post-translational step in HIV-1 Gag assembly. Notably, the compound colocalizes with HIV-1 Gag in situ; however, unexpectedly, selection experiments failed to identify compound-specific resistance mutations in gag or pol, even though known resistance mutations developed in a parallel nelfinavir selection. Thus, we hypothesized that instead of binding to Gag directly, these compounds might localize to assembly intermediates, the intracellular multiprotein complexes containing Gag and host factors that are formed during immature HIV-1 capsid assembly. Indeed, imaging of infected cells showed colocalization of the compound with two host enzymes found in assembly intermediates, ABCE1 and DDX6. While the exact target and mechanism of action of this chemotype remain to be determined, these findings suggest that these compounds represent first-in-class, host-targeting inhibitors of intracellular events in HIV-1 assembly.

IMPORTANCEThe success of antiretroviral treatment for HIV-1 is at risk of being undermined by the growing problem of drug resistance. Thus, there is a need to identify antiretrovirals that act on viral life cycle stages not targeted by drugs in use, such as the events of HIV-1 Gag assembly. To address this gap, we developed a compound screen that recapitulates the intracellular events of HIV-1 assembly, including viral-host interactions that promote assembly. This effort led to identification of a new chemotype that inhibits HIV-1 replication at nanomolar concentrations by inhibiting virus production. This compound colocalized with Gag and two host enzymes that facilitate capsid assembly but resistance selection did not result in compound-specific mutations in gag, suggesting that the chemotype does not directly target Gag. We hypothesize that this chemotype may represent a first-in-class inhibitor of virus production that acts by targeting a viral-host complex important for HIV-1 Gag assembly.","NA"

LotB has an additional ubiquitin binding site (S1) enabling specific cleavage of Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains.

We found that downregulation of Fyn in dMSNs, but not in iMSNs, reduces excessive alcohol but not saccharin intake. D1Rs are coupled to Gs/olf, which activate cAMP signaling. To examine whether Fyns actions are mediated through cAMP signaling, DMS dMSNs were infected with GsDREADD, and the activation of Fyn signaling was measured following CNO treatment. We found that remote stimulation of cAMP signaling in DMS dMSNs activates Fyn and promotes the phosphorylation of the Fyn substrate, GluN2B. In contract, remote activation of GsDREADD in DLS dMSNs did not alter Fyn signaling. We then tested whether activation of GsDREADD in DMS dMSNs or iMSNs alters alcohol intake and observed that CNO-dependent activation of GsDREADD in DMS dMSNs but not iMSNs increases alcohol but not saccharin intake. Finally, we examined the contribution of Fyn to GsDREADD-dependent increase in alcohol intake, and found that systemic administration of the Fyn inhibitor, AZD0503 blocks GsDREADD-dependent increase in alcohol consumption.

Our model captures known behaviors of innate immune cells, including adaptation to changing environments and the development of hyposensitivity after prolonged exposure to activating signals. Our analysis also reveals a tradeoff between precision and adaptation. Maintaining the ability to adapt to different environments leads to heterogeneous responses, even for hypothetical populations of immune cells and targets that have identical surface receptor and ligand expression.

Despite the numerous methodologies available, a tool for obtaining chemical information non-invasively is still missing at this scale. Observer effects, sample destruction and complex preparatory procedures remain a necessary compromise1. Among non-invasive spectroscopic techniques, one able to provide holistic and highly resolved chemical information in-vivo is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)2,3. For its renowned informative power and ability to foster discoveries and life-saving applications4,5, efficient NMR at microscopic scales is highly sought after6-10, but so far technical limitations could not match the stringent necessities of microbiology, such as biocompatible handling, ease of use, and high throughput. Here we introduce a novel microsystem, which combines CMOS technology with 3D microfabrication, enabling nL NMR as a platform tool for non-invasive spectroscopy of organoids, 3D cell cultures, and early stage embryos. In this study we show its application to microlivers models simulating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), demonstrating detection of lipid metabolism dynamics in a time frame of 14 days based on 117 measurements of single 3D human liver microtissues.","NA"

Although the mechanical properties of single molecular motors are relatively well characterised, it remains elusive how the three-dimensional geometry of a load imposed on a motor affects its processivity, i.e., the average distance that a motor moves per interaction with a filament. Here, we theoretically explore this question for a single kinesin molecular motor by analysing the load-dependence of the stepping and detachment processes. We find that the processivity of kinesin increases with lowering the load angle between kinesin and microtubule filament, due to the deceleration of the detachment rate. When the load angle is large, the processivity is predicted to enhance with accelerating the stepping rate, through an optimal distribution of the load over the kinetic transition rates underlying a mechanical step of the motor. These results provide new insights into understanding of the design of potential synthetic biomolecular machines that can travel long distances with high velocities.","NA"

Drosophila fruit flies have the longest sperm known, which are evolving under postcopulatory sexual selection, driven by sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Long sperm outcompete short sperm but primarily when females have a long seminal receptacle (SR), the primary sperm storage organ. Thus, selection on sperm length is mediated by SR length, and the two traits are coevolving across the Drosophila lineage, driven by a genetic correlation and fitness advantage of long sperm and long SR genotypes in both males and females. Ecdysone induced protein 74EF (Eip74EF) is expressed during post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis, when spermatid elongation occurs, and we found that it is rapidly evolving under positive selection in Drosophila. Hypomorphic knockout of the E74A isoform leads to shorter sperm but does not affect SR length, suggesting that E74A may be involved in promoting spermatid elongation but is not a genetic driver of male-female coevolution. We also found that E74A knockout has opposing effects on fecundity in males and females, with an increase in fecundity for males but a decrease in females, consistent with its documented role in oocyte maturation. Our results suggest a novel function of Eip74EF in spermatogenesis and demonstrates that this gene influences both male and female reproductive success. We speculate on possible roles for E74A in spermatogenesis and male reproductive success.

RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTSEip74EF promotes oocyte maturation in Drosophila. We found evidence that it also promotes sperm elongation in males, but at a cost to male fecundity. Mutant males have shorter sperm but have higher reproductive success, while females have reduced fecundity.","NA"

We report deeply resolved phylogenies for tens of thousands of metastatically disseminated cancer cells. We observe surprisingly diverse metastatic phenotypes, ranging from metastasis-incompetent to highly aggressive populations, and these differences are associated with characteristic changes in transcriptional state, including differential expression of metastasis-related genes like IFI27 and ID3. We further show that metastases transit via tissue routes that are diverse, complex, and multidirectional, and identify examples of reseeding, seeding cascades, and parallel seeding topologies. More broadly, we demonstrate the power of next-generation lineage tracers to record cancer evolution at high resolution and vast scale.

Most TEs studied to date are relatively small (50 - 12000 bp), but can contribute to very large proportions of genomes. Here we report the discovery of a giant tyrosine-recombinase-mobilized DNA transposon, Enterprise, from the model fungus Podospora anserina. Previously, we described a large genomic feature called the Spok block which is notable due to the presence of meiotic drive genes of the Spok gene family. The Spok block ranges from 110 kb to 247 kb and can be present in at least four different genomic locations within P. anserina, despite what is an otherwise highly conserved genome structure. We have determined that the reason for its varying positions is that the Spok block is not only capable of meiotic drive, but is also capable of transposition. More precisely, the Spok block represents a unique case where the Enterprise has captured the Spoks, thereby parasitizing a resident genomic parasite to become a genomic hyperparasite. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Enterprise (without the Spoks) is found in other fungal lineages, where it can be as large as 70 kb. Lastly, we provide experimental evidence that the Spok block is deleterious, with detrimental effects on spore production in strains which carry it. In contrast to the selfish role of the Enterprise in P. anserina, we hypothesize that the mobility of the Enterprise may also play an adaptive role in fungi when Enterprise undergoes horizontal transfer while carrying metabolic genes. This union of meiotic drivers and a transposon has created a selfish element of impressive size in Podospora, challenging our perception of how TEs influence genome evolution and broadening the horizons in terms of what the upper limit of transposition may be.","NA"

However, it is not yet clear how such covert shifts of visual attention to peripheral regions impact the processing of the targets we directly foveate as they move in our visual field. The current study utilised the co-registration of eye-position and EEG recordings while participants tracked moving targets that were embedded with a 30 Hz frequency tag in a Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) paradigm. When the task required attention to be divided between the moving target (overt attention) and a peripheral region where a second target might appear (covert attention), the SSVEPs elicited by the tracked target at the 30 Hz frequency band were significantly lower than when participants did not have to covertly monitor for a second target. Our findings suggest that neural responses of overt attention are reduced when attention is divided between covert and overt areas. This neural evidence is in line with theoretical accounts describing attention as a pool of finite resources, such as the perceptual load theory. Altogether, these results have practical implications for many real-world situations where covert shifts of attention may reduce visual processing of objects even when they are directly being tracked with the eyes.","NA"

Mechanisms must be in place along the route to ensure they connect with their targets in an orderly fashion. The ventral telencephalon acts as an instructive tissue, but the importance of the diencephalon in TCA mapping is unknown. We report that disruption of diencephalic development by Pax6 deletion results in a thalamocortical projection containing mapping errors. We used conditional mutagenesis to test whether these errors are due to the disruption of pioneer projections from prethalamus to thalamus and found that, while this correlates with abnormal TCA fasciculation, it does not induce topographical errors. To test whether the thalamus contains navigational cues for TCAs, we used slice culture transplants and gene expression studies. We found the thalamic environment is instructive for TCA navigation and that the molecular cues Netrin1 and Semaphorin3a are likely to be involved. Our findings indicate that the correct topographic mapping of TCAs onto the cortex requires the order to be established from the earliest stages of their growth by molecular cues in the thalamus itself.","NA"

While the overall mechanism of the transport cycle has been characterized in detail for several important members of this transporter family, it is less well understood how the activity of ABC transporters is regulated in the cell post-translationally. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of MlaFB from E. coli, an ABC nucleotide binding domain (MlaF) in complex with its putative regulatory subunit (MlaB). MlaFB constitutes the cytoplasmic portion of the larger MlaFEDB ABC transporter complex, which drives phospholipid transport across the bacterial envelope and is important for maintaining the integrity of the outer membrane barrier. Our data show that the regulatory subunit MlaB, a STAS domain protein, binds to the nucleotide binding domain and is required for its stability. Our structure also implicates a unique C-terminal tail of the ABC subunit, MlaF, in self-dimerization. Both the C-terminal tail of MlaF and the interaction with MlaB are required for the proper assembly of the MlaFEDB complex and its function in cells. This work leads to a new model for how the activity of an important bacterial lipid transporter may be regulated by small binding proteins, and raises the possibility that similar regulatory mechanisms may exist more broadly across the ABC transporter family, from bacteria to humans.","NA"

From the scaffolds adding up to 214 Mb after the iterative approach, 180 Mb were placed onto chromosomes resulting in an assembly with an L50 of 2. The percent Ns (unspecified nucleotides A, C, G or T) for Indian strain remains low at 6.9 percent and based on the gene annotation/synteny, the genome is roughly more than 85% complete.

We present action spectrum and genetic data indicating that the light-induced recruitment of ribosomes to psbA mRNA is triggered by D1 photodamage, whereas the global stimulation of translation elongation is triggered by photosynthetic electron transport. Furthermore, mutants lacking HCF136, which mediates an early step in D1 assembly, exhibit constitutively high psbA ribosome occupancy in the dark, and differ in this way from mutants lacking PSII for other reasons. These results, together with the recent elucidation of a thylakoid membrane complex that functions in PSII assembly, PSII repair and psbA translation, suggest an autoregulatory mechanism in which the light-induced degradation of D1 relieves repressive interactions between D1 and translational activators in the complex. We suggest that the presence of D1 in this complex coordinates D1 synthesis with the need for nascent D1 during both PSII biogenesis and PSII repair in plant chloroplasts.

Significance StatementPhotosystem II (PSII) harbors the water-splitting activity underlying oxygenic photosynthesis. The PSII reaction center protein D1 is subject to photodamage and must be replaced with nascent D1 to maintain photosynthetic activity. How new D1 synthesis is coordinated with D1 damage has been a long-standing question. Our results clarify the nature of the light-induced signal that activates D1 synthesis for PSII repair in plants, and suggest an autoregulatory mechanism in which degradation of damaged D1 relieves a repressive interaction between D1 and translational activators in a complex that functions in PSII assembly and repair. This proposed mechanism comprises a responsive switch that couples D1 synthesis to need for D1 during PSII biogenesis and repair.","NA"

Although high resolution structures exist for AcrB, its conformational fluctuations and their putative role in function are largely unknown, preventing a complete mechanistic understanding of efflux and inhibition. Here, we determine these structural dynamics in the presence of AcrB substrates using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, complemented by molecular modelling, drug binding and bacterial susceptibility studies. We show that the well-studied efflux pump inhibitor phenylalanine-arginine-{beta}-naphthylamide (PA{beta}N) potentiates antibiotic activity by restraining drug-binding pocket dynamics, rather than preventing antibiotic binding. We also reveal that a drug-binding pocket substitution discovered within an MDR clinical isolate, AcrBG288D, modifies the plasticity of the transport pathway, which could explain its altered substrate specificity. Our results provide molecular insight into drug export and inhibition of a major MDR-conferring efflux pump and the important directive role of its dynamics.","NA"

Previous studies identified m6A in both the 18S and 28S rRNAs, but the roles of these methylation events are poorly understood due to the lack of knowledge of the responsible methyltransferases. Here, we report that mammalian METTL5, a member of a highly conserved methyltransferase family, specifically methylates adenosine 1832 (A1832) in the 18S rRNA in vivo and in vitro. We identify TRMT112 as a near stoichiometric partner of METTL5 important for the enzymatic activity of METTL5. By mapping the positions of translating ribosomes (Ribo-seq), we found translation of multiple stress response-related mRNAs, including Atf4 mRNA, is selectively reduced in the Mettl5 knockout (KO) mouse B16 melanoma cells. Atf4 is a key transcription factor that mediates the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), as exemplified by the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress. Consistently, transcription of ISR effector genes is reduced in Mettl5 KO cells during ER stress, suggesting a compromised ISR. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that regulates expression of stress response genes and suggest that chemical modifications of ribosomal RNAs may play a key role in selectively impacting translation and possibly ISR.","NA"

Here, we performed two experiments to mimic: 1) storage and 2) subsequent anaerobic digestion. For the food-waste storage system, we designed a mixed-level fractional factorial analysis with 12 experimental combinations, including separating food waste into: carbohydrate-rich, lipid-rich, and protein-rich food waste. We found that all factors that we tested correlated with the fermentation product spectra, but that especially the factors: i) storage temperature; ii) food-waste composition; and iii) storage time affected the fermentation outcome. We observed that relatively low pH levels of 3-4, which were achieved due to rapid lactic acid accumulation by microbial activity during storage, coincided with greater lactate production at a maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) selectivity of 90%. This provides an opportunity to optimize lactate production, which is ideal for subsequent methane or chemical production.

Within the small intestinal epithelium, adult stem cells integrate diverse signals to regulate regeneration and differentiation, thereby establishing overall cellularity. Accordingly, directing stem cell differentiation could provide a tractable approach to alter the abundance or quality of specialized cells of the small intestinal epithelium, including the secretory Paneth, goblet, and enteroendocrine populations. Yet, to date, there has been a lack of suitable tools and rigorous approaches to identify biological targets and pharmacological agents that can modify epithelial composition to enable causal testing of disease-associated changes with novel therapeutic candidates. To empower the search for epithelia-modifying agents, we establish a first-of-its-kind high-throughput phenotypic organoid screen. We demonstrate the ability to screen thousands of samples and uncover biological targets and associated small molecule inhibitors which translate to in vivo. This approach is enabled by employing a functional, cell-type specific, scalable assay on an organoid model designed to represent the physiological cues of in vivo Paneth cell differentiation from adult intestinal stem cells. Further, we miniaturize and adapt the organoid culture system to enable automated plating and screening, thereby providing the ability to test thousands of samples. Strikingly, in our screen we identify inhibitors of the nuclear exporter Xpo1 modulate stem cell fate commitment by inducing a pan-epithelial stress response combined with an interruption of mitogen signaling in cycling intestinal progenitors, thereby significantly increasing the abundance of Paneth cells independent of known WNT and Notch differentiation cues. We extend our observation in vivo, demonstrating that oral administration of Xpo1 inhibitor KPT-330 at doses 1,000-fold lower than conventionally used in hematologic malignancies increases Paneth cell abundance.

Spores are resistant to a wide series of stress agents, including UV radiation, and can last for tens to hundreds of years. Due to the suspension of biological functions such as DNA repair, they accumulate DNA damage upon exposure to UV radiation. Differently from active organisms, the most common DNA photoproduct in spores are not cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, but rather the so-called spore photoproduct. This non-canonical photochemistry results from the dry state of DNA and the binding to small acid soluble proteins that drastically modify the structure and photoreactivity of the nucleic acid. In this contribution, we use multiscale molecular dynamics simulations including extended classical molecular dynamics and QM/MM biased dynamics to elucidate the coupling of electronic and structural factors leading to this photochemical outcome. In particular, we rationalize the well-described impact of the peculiar DNA environment found in spores on the favored formation of the spore photoproduct, given the small free energy barrier found for this path. Meanwhile, the specific organization of spore DNA precludes the photochemical path leading to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers formation.

The key strength of such data is that they allow to quantify individual variation in vital rates (e.g. survival, growth, reproduction) and then link it mechanistically to dynamics at the population level. However, maintaining the collection of individual-based data over long time periods comes with large logistic efforts and costs, and studies spanning over decades are therefore rare. This is the case particularly for migratory aquatic species, many of which are in decline despite their high ecological, cultural, and economical value.

New informationThis paper describes two unique publicly available time series of individual-based data originating from a 51-year mark-recapture study of a land-locked population of large-sized migratory brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Norway: the Hunder trout. In the period 1966-2015, nearly 14,000 adult Hunder trout have been captured and individually marked during their spawning migration from Lake Mjosa to the river Gubrandsdalsl[a]gen. Almost a third of those individuals were later recaptured alive during a later spawning run and/or captured by fishermen and reported dead or alive. This has resulted in the first data series: a mark-recapture-recovery dataset spanning half a century and more than 18,000 capture records. The second data series consists of additional data on juvenile and adult growth and life-history schedules from half of the marked individuals, obtained by means of scale sample analysis. The two datasets offer a rare long-term perspective on individuals and population dynamics and provide unique opportunities to gain insights into questions surrounding management, conservation, and restoration of migratory salmonid populations and freshwater ecosystems.","NA"

Metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) binning methods have emerged as a promising approach to recover individual genomes from metagenomic data. However, MAG binning has not been well assessed for its ability to recover mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids and genomic islands (GIs), that have very high clinical/agricultural/environmental importance. Certain antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and virulence factor (VF) genes are noted to be disproportionately associated with MGEs, making studying their transmission a public health priority. However, the variable copy number and sequence composition of MGEs relative to the majority of the host genome makes them potentially problematic for MAG binning methods. To systematically investigate this, we simulated a low-complexity metagenome comprising 30 GI-rich and plasmid-containing bacterial genomes. MAGs were then recovered using 12 current prediction pipelines and evaluated for recovery of MGE-associated AMR/VF genes. Here we show that while 82-94% of chromosomes could be correctly recovered and binned, only 38-44% of GIs were recovered and, even more notably, only 1-29% of plasmid sequences were found. Most strikingly, no plasmid-borne VF or AMR genes were recovered and within GIs, only between 0-45% of AMR or VF genes were identified. We conclude that short-read MAGs are largely ineffective for the analysis of mobile genes, including those of public-health importance like AMR and VF genes.

Many studies of the molecular and cellular basis of neurodegeneration in PD have made use of iPSC-derived neurons from patients with familial PD mutations. However, approximately half of the cells in the brain are glia, and their role facilitating neurodegeneration is unclear. We developed a novel serum-free protocol to generate midbrain astrocytes from patient-derived iPSCs harbouring the pathogenic p.A30P, p.A53T mutations in SNCA, as well as duplication and triplication of the SNCA locus. In our cellular model, aggregates of alpha-synuclein occurred only within the GFAP+ astrocytes carrying the pathogenic SNCA mutations. Assessment of spontaneous cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) release using Fluo4 revealed that SNCA mutant astrocytes released excess Ca2+ compared to controls. Unbiased evaluation of 3D mitochondrial morphometric parameters showed that these SNCA mutant astrocytes had increased mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased mitochondrial connectivity compared to controls, and reduced mitochondrial bioenergetic function. This comprehensive assessment of different pathogenic SNCA mutations derived from PD patients using the same cellular model enabled assessment of the mutation effect, showing that p.A53T and triplication astrocytes were the most severely affected. Together, our results indicate that astrocytes harbouring the familial PD mutations in SNCA are dysfunctional, suggesting a contributory role for dysfunctional astrocytes in the disease mechanism and pathogenesis of PD.

However, sequencing libraries suitable for genotyping require whole genome amplification, which introduces allelic bias and copy errors. As a result, single cell DNA sequencing data violates the assumptions of variant callers developed for bulk sequencing, which when applied to single cells generate significant numbers of false positives and false negatives. Only dedicated models accounting for amplification bias and errors will be able to provide more accurate calls.

We present ProSolo, a probabilistic model for calling single nucleotide variants from multiple displacement amplified single cell DNA sequencing data. It introduces a mechanistically motivated empirical model of amplification bias that improves the quantification of genotyping uncertainty. To account for amplification errors, it jointly models the single cell sample with a bulk sequencing sample from the same cell population--also enabling a biologically relevant imputation of missing genotypes for the single cell. Through these innovations, ProSolo achieves substantially higher performance in calling and genotyping single nucleotide variants in single cells in comparison to all state-of-the-art tools. Moreover, ProSolo implements the first approach to control the false discovery rate reliably and flexibly; not only for single nucleotide variant calls, but also for artefacts of single cell methodology that one may wish to identify, such as allele dropout.

However, current genomics infrastructure--including most genotyping arrays and sequenced reference panels--best serves populations of European descent. A critical step for facilitating genetic studies in underrepresented populations is to ensure that genetic technologies accurately capture variation in all populations. Here, we quantify the accuracy of low-coverage sequencing in diverse African populations.

ResultsWe sequenced the whole genomes of 91 individuals to high-coverage ([&ge;]20X) from the Neuropsychiatric Genetics of African Population-Psychosis (NeuroGAP-Psychosis) study, in which participants were recruited from Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. We empirically tested two data generation strategies, GWAS arrays versus low-coverage sequencing, by calculating the concordance of imputed variants from these technologies with those from deep whole genome sequencing data. We show that low-coverage sequencing at a depth of [&ge;]4X captures variants of all frequencies more accurately than all commonly used GWAS arrays investigated and at a comparable cost. Lower depths of sequencing (0.5-1X) performed comparable to commonly used low-density GWAS arrays. Low-coverage sequencing is also sensitive to novel variation, with 4X sequencing detecting 45% of singletons and 95% of common variants identified in high-coverage African whole genomes.

ConclusionThese results indicate that low-coverage sequencing approaches surmount the problems induced by the ascertainment of common genotyping arrays, including those that capture variation most common in Europeans and Africans. Low-coverage sequencing effectively identifies novel variation (particularly in underrepresented populations), and presents opportunities to enhance variant discovery at a similar cost to traditional approaches.","NA"

However, precise estimates of innervation density are only available for some body parts, such as the hands, and estimates of the total number of tactile afferent fibers are inconsistent and incomplete. Here we reconcile different estimates and provide plausible ranges and best estimates for the number of different tactile fiber types innervating different regions of the skin, using evidence from dorsal root fiber counts, microneurography, histology, and psychophysics. We estimate that the skin across the whole body is innervated by approximately 230,000 tactile afferent fibers (plausible range: 200,000-270,000). 15% innervate the palmar skin of both hands and 19% the region surrounding the face and lips. Around 60% of all tactile fibers are slowly-adapting, while the rest are fastadapting.

Thus, defining novel phospho-Rab interacting partners is critical to our understanding of the molecular basis of LRRK2 pathogenesis. RILPL2 binds with strong preference to LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab8A and Rab10. RILPL2 is a binding partner of the motor protein and Rab effector, Myosin Va. We show here that the globular tail domain of Myosin Va also contains a high affinity binding site for LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10, and certain tissue-specific Myosin Va isoforms strongly prefer to bind phosphorylated Rab10. In the presence of pathogenic LRRK2, RILPL2 relocalizes to the peri-centriolar region in a phosphoRab10- and Myosin Va-dependent manner. In the absence of phosphoRab10, expression of RILPL2 or depletion of Myosin Va increase centriolar RILPL2 levels, and either condition is sufficient to block ciliogenesis in RPE cells. These experiments show that LRRK2 generated phosphoRab10 dramatically redistributes Myosin Va-RILPL2 complexes to the mother centriole, which may sequester Myosin Va and RILPL2 in a manner that blocks their normal roles in ciliogenesis.","NA"

In cultured ECs, endogenous LPHN2 localizes at ECM adhesions, signals through cAMP/Rap1, and, via its fibronectin-leucine-rich transmembrane (FLRT)-binding domain, negatively regulates ECM-elicited haptotaxis. ECs also express endogenous FLRT2 ligand that promotes cAMP/Rap1 signaling and hinders haptotaxis in a LPHN2-dependent manner. Vascular ECs of lphn2a knock-out zebrafish embryos become abnormally stretched, display a hyperactive Hippo mechanosensing pathway, and lack proper intercellular junctions. Indeed, intravascularly injected cancer cells extravasate more easily in lphn2a null animals.

To date MMF systems have been based on linear fluorescence and are therefore only able to perform two-dimensional imaging due to an absence of confocal filtering6. Here we report a method to achieve optical sectioning in live brain tissue by taking advantage of the nonlinearity of two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF). In addition, we provide a new approach for the determination of transmission matrix for TPEF, a necessary step for the light shaping requirement of MMF imaging. Central to these advances is the use of a laser source able to generate both continuous wave (CW) light and femtosecond pulses. This configuration allows the system to be compact with minimal distal optics, enhancing suitability for neuroscience applications. With our system we demonstrate TPEF imaging of neurons and their dendrites in live brain slices through a single 60 m-core MMF with a numerical aperture of 0.37.

Two neurosteroid analogues with diazirine moieties replacing the 3-hydroxyl (KK148 and KK150) bind to all three sites, but do not potentiate GABAAR currents. KK148 is a desensitizing agent, whereas KK150 is devoid of allosteric activity. These compounds provide potential chemical scaffolds for site-specific and general neurosteroid antagonists.

We show that a mutation in the ciliary gene Inpp5e leads to a transient increase in direct neurogenesis and subsequently to an overproduction of layer V neurons in newborn mice. Loss of Inpp5e also affects ciliary structure coinciding with increased Akt and mTOR signalling and reduced Gli3 repressor levels. Genetically re-storing Gli3 repressor rescues the decreased indirect neurogenesis in Inpp5e mutants.

Caused by a toxic gain-of-function in the encoded glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) enzyme, the neuropathology appears to be independent of the canonical role of GlyRS in aminoacylation. Patients display progressive, life-long weakness and wasting of muscles in hands followed by feet, with frequently associated deficits in sensation. When dysfunction is observed in motor and sensory nerves, there is a diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D), or distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V if the symptoms are purely motor. The cause of this varied sensory involvement remains unresolved, as are the pathomechanisms underlying the selective neurodegeneration characteristic of the disease. We have previously identified in CMT2D mice that neuropathy-causing Gars mutations perturb sensory neuron fate and permit mutant GlyRS to aberrantly interact with neurotrophin receptors (Trks). Here, we extend this work by interrogating further the anatomy and function of the CMT2D sensory nervous system in mutant Gars mice, obtaining several key results: 1) sensory pathology is restricted to neurons innervating the hindlimbs; 2) perturbation of sensory development is not common in mouse models of neuromuscular disease; 3) in vitro axonal transport of signalling endosomes is not impaired in afferent neurons of all CMT2D mouse models; and 4) Gars expression is selectively elevated in a subset of sensory neurons and linked to sensory developmental defects.

A single-SNP variant within the mitochondrial cox1 gene is used to distinguish the recently-invading CRB-G lineage from other haplotypes, but the lack of mitogenome sequence for this species hinders further development of a molecular toolset for biosecurity and management programmes against CRB.

Sequencing data were generated using long-read Nanopore technology from genomic DNA isolated from a CRB-G female.

Independently-generated transcriptome data were used to assess the O. rhinoceros mitogenome annotation and transcription. The aligned sequences of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) (with degenerate third codon position) from O. rhinoceros, 13 other Scarabaeidae taxa and two outgroup taxa were used for the phylogenetic reconstruction with the Maximum likelihood (ML) approach in IQ-TREE and Bayesian (BI) approach in MrBayes.

The complete circular mitochondrial genome of O. rhinoceros is 20,898 bp-long, with a gene content canonical for insects (13 PCGs, 2 rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes), as well as one structural variation (rearrangement of trnQ and trnI) and a long control region (6,204 bp). Transcription was detected across all 37 genes, and interestingly, within three domains in the control region.

Unlike in mammals, this complex is not required for meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, the process whereby hemizygous sex chromosomes are transcriptionally silenced. Interestingly, brc-1 and brd-1 mutants showed meiotic recombination phenotypes that are largely opposing to those previously reported for female meiosis. Fewer meiotic recombination foci marked by the recombinase RAD-51 were observed in brc-1 and brd-1 mutants, and the reduction in RAD-51 foci can be suppressed by mutation of nonhomologous end joining proteins. We show that concentration of BRC-1-BRD-1 to sites of meiotic recombination is dependent on DNA end resection, suggesting that BRC-1-BRD-1 regulates the processing of meiotic double strand breaks to promote repair by homologous recombination, similar to a role for the complex in somatic cells.

Neither is context represented explicitly in our model, nor is context change signaled. We find that memory-intact agents learn distinct context representations, and develop ABA renewal, whereas memory-impaired agents do not.

Here, we report a novel method for identifying pleiotropic genes and variants that associate with healthy individuals of three extreme and contrasting ""Prakriti"" constitutions through exome sequencing and state-of-the-art computational methods. Exome Seq of three extreme Prakriti types from 108 healthy individuals 54 each from genetically homogeneous populations of North India (NI, Discovery cohort) and Western India (VADU, Replication cohort) were evaluated. Fishers Exact Test was applied between Prakriti types in both cohorts and further permutation based p-value was used for selection of exonic variants. To investigate the effect of sample size per genetic association test, we performed power analysis. Functional impact of differentiating genes and variations were inferred using diverse resources -Toppfun, GTEx, GWAS, PheWAS, UK Biobank and mouse knockdown/knockout phenotype (MGI). We also applied supervised machine learning approach to evaluate the association of exonic variants with multisystem phenotypes of Prakriti. Our targeted investigation into exome sequencing from NI (discovery) and VADU (validation) cohorts datasets provide ~7,000 differentiating SNPs. Closer inspection further identified a subset of SNPs (2407 (NI) and 2393 (VADU)), that mapped to an overlapping set of 1181 genes. This set can robustly stratify the Prakriti groups into three distinct clusters with distinct gene ontological (GO) enrichments. Functional analysis further strengthens the potential pleiotropic effects of these differentiating genes/variants and multisystem phenotypic consequences. Replicated SNPs map to some very prominent genes like FIG4, EDNRA, ANKLE1, BCKDHA, ATP5SL, EXOCS5, IFIT5, ZNF502, PNPLA3 and IL6R. Lastly, multivariate analysis using random forest uncovered rs7244213 within urea transporter SLC14A2, that associate with an ensemble of features linked to distinct constitutions. Our results reinforce the concept of integration of Prakriti based deep phenotypes for risk stratification of healthy individuals and provides markers for early actionable interventions.","NA"

We examined potential monthly-scale selective pressures in the model forest yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus. Contrary to expectations of seasonal adaptation, the S. paradoxus population was stable over four seasons in the face of abiotic and biotic environmental changes. While the S. paradoxus population was diverse, including 41 unique genotypes among 192 sampled isolates, there was no correlation between S. paradoxus genotypes and seasonal environments. Consistent with observations from other S. paradoxus populations, the forest population was highly clonal and inbred. This lack of recombination, paired with population stability, implies that S. paradoxus evolved the phenotypic plasticity needed to resist seasonal environmental fluctuations long ago, and that individual S. paradoxus are generalists with regard to seasonal environments. Similarly, while the forest population included diversity among phenotypes related to intraspecific interference competition, there was no evidence for active coevolution among these phenotypes. At least ten percent of the forest S. paradoxus individuals produced ""killer toxins"", which kill sensitive Saccharomyces cells, but the presence of a toxin-producing isolate did not predict resistance to the toxin among nearby isolates. How forest yeasts acclimate to changing environments remains an open question, and future studies should investigate the physiological responses that allow microbial cells to cope with environmental fluctuations in their native habitats.","NA"

Focusing on the synaptic adhesion molecule leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein 2 (LRFN2), we establish that SNX27 binds to LRFN2 and is responsible for regulating its endosomal sorting. LRFN2 associates with AMPA receptors and knockdown of LRFN2 phenocopies SNX27 depletion in decreasing surface expression of AMPA receptors, reducing synaptic activity and attenuating hippocampal long-term potentiation. Our evidence suggests that, in contrast to previous reports, SNX27 does not directly bind to AMPA receptors, and instead controls AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission and plasticity indirectly through the endosomal sorting of LRFN2.

A network involving the basal ganglia mediates two forms of response inhibition: reactive and proactive inhibition. Reactive inhibition serves to abruptly stop motor activity, whereas proactive inhibition is goal-orientated and results in slowing of motor activity in anticipation of stopping. Due to its impairment in several psychiatric disorders, the neurochemistry of response inhibition has become of recent interest. Dopamine has been posed as a candidate mediator of response inhibition due to its role in functioning of the basal ganglia and the observation that patients with Parkinsons disease on dopamine agonists develop impulse control disorders. Although the effects of dopamine on reactive inhibition have been studied, substantial literature on the role of dopamine on proactive inhibition is lacking. To fill this gap, we devised a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 1 mg ropinirole (a dopamine agonist) on response inhibition in healthy volunteers. We found that whilst reactive inhibition was unchanged, proactive inhibition was impaired when participants were on ropinirole relative to when on placebo. To investigate how ropinirole mediated this effect on proactive inhibition, we used hierarchical drift-diffusion modelling. We found that ropinirole impaired the ability to raise the decision threshold when proactive inhibition was called upon. Our results provide novel evidence that an acute dose of ropinirole selectively reduces proactive inhibition in healthy participants. These results may help explain how ropinirole induces impulse control disorders in susceptible patients with Parkinsons disease.","NA"

Over a shorter time scale, PV interneurons can alternate between high and low plasticity states (PV-plasticity) to regulate memory encoding and consolidation.

We now show that iPlasticity and PV-plasticity in the adult visual cortex are induced by the activation of TrkB neurotrophin receptors in PV interneurons. Optical activation of TrkB specifically in PV interneurons switches adult cortical networks into a state of elevated plasticity within minutes.

In a within-subject design, 22 patients underwent 4-minute periods of stimulation at 10 Hz (alpha), 7 Hz (high-theta, control), and 1 Hz (control) in a pseudo-randomized order. Patients underwent stimulation both sitting and standing and verbally rated their pain before and after each stimulation block on a 0-10 numerical rating scale. Global alpha power was significantly higher during 10 Hz compared to 1 Hz stimulation when patients were standing (t = -6.08, p <.001). On a more regional level, a significant increase of alpha power was found in the right-middle and left-posterior region when patients were sitting. With respect to our secondary aim, no significant reduction of pain intensity and unpleasantness was found. However, only the alpha stimulation resulted in a minimal clinically important difference in at least 50% of participants for pain intensity (50%) and unpleasantness ratings (65%) in the sitting condition. This study provides initial evidence for the potential of visual stimulation as a means to enhance alpha activity in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The brief period of stimulation was insufficient to reduce chronic pain. This study is the first to provide evidence that a brief period of visual stimulation at alpha frequency can significantly increase alpha power in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

This suppression depends on the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), but surprisingly is implemented through a circuit linking S1 and the auditory thalamocortical system via the auditory midbrain. We also show that an additional, direct pathway exists from S1 to the medial sector of auditory thalamus, which facilitates auditory responses in neurons that do not project to the auditory cortex.

Here, we measure the functional similarity of simulated networks of neurons, by quantifying the similitude of their spiking patterns in response to the same stimuli. We find that common graph theory metrics convey little information about the similarity of networks responses. Instead, we learn a functional metric between networks based on their synaptic differences, and show that it accurately predicts the similarity of novel networks, for a wide range of stimuli. We then show that a sparse set of architectural features - the sum of synaptic inputs that each neuron receives and the sum of each neurons synaptic outputs - predicts the functional similarity of networks of up to 100 cells, with high accuracy. We thus suggest new architectural design principles that shape the function of neural networks, which conform with experimental evidence of homeostatic mechanisms.","NA"

By combining the selective activation of astrocytes with single cell RNA sequencing, we were able to study transcriptional changes that occur in response to the activation of astrocytes at the single cell level. Interestingly, our data shows that long-term activation of astrocytes in healthy mice results in dramatic alteration in the transcriptome of astrocytes and microglia. Genes that were differentially expressed in these Gq-DREADD-activated astrocytes were involved in neurogenesis and low density lipoprotein particle biology, while those in the microglia were involved in the response to lipoproteins, and the migration and chemotaxis of immune cells. Furthermore, network analysis showed that Gq-DREADD-mediated activation in astrocytes resulted in an upregulation of genes involved in the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and calcium ion homeostasis.

However, even small mammals such as mice have on the order of 1 x 1012 synaptic connections which, in simulations, are each typically charaterized by at least one floating-point value. This amounts to several terabytes of data - an unrealistic memory requirement for a single desktop machine. Large models are therefore typically simulated on distributed supercomputers which is costly and limits large-scale modelling to a few privileged research groups. In this work, we describe extensions to GeNN - our Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) accelerated spiking neural network simulator - that enable it to  procedurally generate connectivity and synaptic weights  on the go as spikes are triggered, instead of storing and retrieving them from memory. We find that GPUs are well-suited to this approach because of their raw computational power which, due to memory bandwidth limitations, is often under-utilised when simulating spiking neural networks. We demonstrate the value of our approach with a recent model of the Macaque visual cortex consisting of 4.13 x 106 neurons and 24.2 x 109 synapses. Using our new method, it can be simulated on a single GPU - a significant step forward in making large-scale brain modelling accessible to many more researchers. Our results match those obtained on a supercomputer and the simulation runs up to 35% faster on a single high-end GPU than previously on over 1000 supercomputer nodes.

Significance StatementSimulations are an important tool for investigating how brains work. However, in order to faithfully reproduce some of the features found in biological brains, large models are required. Simulating such models has, until now, required so much memory that it could only be done on large, expensive supercomputers. In this work, we present a new method for simulating large models that significantly reduces memory requirements. This method is particularly well-suited for use on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), which are a common fixture in many workstations. We demonstrate that using our new method we can not only simulate a very large brain model on a single GPU, but also do so up to 35% faster than in previous supercomputer simulations.","NA"

But these oscillations are phasic, and there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that beta burst duration may be of critical importance to motor symptoms, making insights into the dynamics of beta bursting generation valuable. In this study, we ask the question ""Can average burst duration reveal how dynamics change between the ON and OFF medication states?"". Our analysis of local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus demonstrates using linear surrogates that the system generating beta oscillations acts in a more non-linear regime OFF medication and that the change in the degree of non-linearity is correlated with motor impairment. Further, we pinpoint specific dynamical changes responsible for changes in the temporal patterning of beta oscillations between medication states by fitting to data biologically inspired models, and simpler beta envelope models. Finally, we show that the non-linearity can be directly extracted from average burst duration profiles under the assumption of constant noise in envelope models. This reveals that average burst duration profiles provide a window into burst dynamics, which may underlie the success of burst duration as a biomarker. In summary, we demonstrate a relationship between average burst duration profiles, dynamics of the system generating beta oscillations, and motor impairment, which puts us in a better position to understand the pathology and improve therapies such as deep brain stimulation.

Author summaryIn Parkinsons disease, motor impairment is associated with abnormal oscillatory activity of neurons in deep motor regions of the brain. These oscillations come in the shape of bursts, and the duration of these bursts has recently been shown to be of importance to motor symptoms. To better understand the disease and refine therapies, we relate the duration of these bursts to properties of the system generating them in the pathological state and in a proxy of the healthy state. The data suggest that the system generating bursts is more complex in the pathological state, and we show that a measure of this complexity is associated with motor impairment. We propose biologically inspired models and simpler models that can generate the burst patterns observed in the pathological and healthy state. The models confirm what was observed in data, and tell us how burst generation mechanisms could differ in the disease. Finally, we identify a mathematical link allowing to infer properties of the burst generating system from burst duration. This sheds some light on the significance of burst duration as a marker of pathology.","NA"

It is expected therefore that understanding the cellular function of LRRK2 will provide much needed insight on the pathological mechanism of sporadic Parkinsons, which is the most common form. Here we show that constitutive LRRK2 activity represses nascent protein synthesis in rodent neurons. Specifically, enzymatic inhibition of LRRK2, gene silencing or gene knockout of Lrrk2 increase translation. In the rotenone model of Parkinsons, LRRK2 activity increases, leading to repression of translation and dopaminergic neuron atrophy both of which are prevented by LRRK2 inhibition. This is accompanied by altered phosphorylation of eIF2-S52({uparrow}), eIF2s2-S2({downarrow}) and eEF2-T57({uparrow}) in striatum/substantia nigra in a direction that signifies inhibition of protein synthesis. Significantly, LRRK2 is activated and translation is 40% reduced in Parkinsons patient fibroblasts (G2019S and sporadic) and LRRK2 inhibition restores normal translation. In contrast, translation is unchanged in cells from multiple system atrophy patients, implying disease specificity. These findings suggest that LRRK2-dependent repression of translation may be a proximal function of LRRK2 in Parkinsons pathology.","NA"

A rare coding variant of PLCG2, which encodes PLC{gamma}2, shows a significant protective effect for AD (rs72824905, P522R, P=5.38x10-10, Odds Ratio = 0.68). Molecular dynamic modelling of the PLC{gamma}2-R522 variant, situated within the auto-inhibitory domain of PLC{gamma}2, suggests a structural change to the protein. Through CRISPR-engineering we have generated novel PLCG2-R522 harbouring human induced pluripotent cell lines (hiPSC) and a mouse knockin model, neither of which exhibits alterations in endogenous PLCG2 expression. Mouse microglia and macrophages and hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells with the R522 mutation, all demonstrate a consistent non-redundant hyperfunctionality in the context of normal expression of other PLC isoforms. This signalling alteration manifests as enhanced cellular Ca2+ store release ([~]20-40% increase) in response to physiologically-relevant stimuli (e.g. Fc receptor ligation and A{beta} oligomers). This hyperfunctionality resulted in increased PIP2 depletion in the cells with the PLC{gamma}2-R522 variant after exposure to stimuli and reduced basal detection of PIP2 levels in vivo. These PLC{gamma}2-R522 associated abnormalities resulted in impairments to phagocytosis (fungal and bacterial particles) and enhanced endocytosis (A{beta} oligomers and dextran). PLC{gamma}2 sits downstream of disease relevant pathways, such as TREM2 and CSF1R and alterations in its activity, direct impacts cell function, which in the context of the inherent drugability of enzymes such as PLC{gamma}2, raise the prospect of manipulation of PLC{gamma}2 as a therapeutic target in Alzheimers Disease.","NA"

We acquired diffusion-weighted images (DWI) of wild type (WT) and ArcA{beta} transgenic (TG) mice using a 9.4 T MRI scanner. Fixel-based analysis (FBA) was performed to measure fiber tract-specific properties. We also performed three complementary experiments; to identify the global differences in structural connectivity, to compute network properties and to measure cellular basis of white matter alterations.

Transgenic mice displayed disrupted structural connectivity centered to the entorhinal cortex (EC) and a lower fiber density and fiber bundle cross-section. In addition, there was a reduced network efficiency and degree centrality in weighted structural connectivity in the transgenic mice. To further examine the underlying neuronal basis of connectivity and network deficits, we performed histology experiments. We found no alteration in myelination and an increased level of neurofilament light (NFL) in the brain regions with disrupted connectivity in the TG mice. Furthermore, TG mice had a reduced number of perineuronal nets (PNN) in the EC.

The observed FDC reductions may indicate a decrease in axonal diameter or axon count which would explain the basis of connectivity deficits and reduced network efficiency in TG mice. The increase in NFL suggests a breakdown of axonal integrity, which would reduce WM fiber health. Considering the pivotal role of the EC in AD, A{beta} deposition may primarily increase NFL release, damaging PNN in the entorhinal pathway, resulting in disrupted structural connectivity.","NA"

MethodsTwo-hundred and fifty-one participants, aged 19-81 years, completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 2 diffusion tensor imaging sessions, on average 3 years apart, allowing estimates of decline in hippocampal microstructural integrity as indexed by increased mean diffusivity (MD). We used the delayed recall from the California Verbal Learning Test to measure memory change. 18F-Flutemetamol PET, in 108 participants above 44 years of age, yielded 23 A{beta} positive cases. Genotyping enabled controlling for APOE {varepsilon}4 status, and polygenic scores for sleep efficiency and AD.

ResultsWorse global sleep quality and sleep efficiency related to more rapid reduction in hippocampal microstructural integrity over time. Focusing on sleep efficiency, this relationship was stronger in presence of cortical A{beta} accumulation. Sleep efficiency also related to memory decline indirectly via hippocampal integrity decline. The results were not explained by genetic risk for sleep efficiency and AD.

ConclusionsPoor self-reported sleep efficiency related to decline in hippocampal integrity, especially in the presence of A{beta} accumulation. Poor sleep and hippocampal microstructural decline may partly explain memory decline in older adults with A{beta} pathology.

Critically, they dampen the endocrine response to acute challenges and decrease intrinsic excitability of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (CRHPVN), suggesting key circuits may be less responsive to stress. Here, we make the surprising discovery that CRHPVN neurons harness a form of adaptive synaptic scaling to escape the persistent negative feedback pressure from CORT and maintain stable output in vivo. Specifically, there is an increase in glutamatergic drive to these cells that is mediated by a postsynaptic, multiplicative increase in synaptic strength. These findings suggest that dysfunctions associated with chronic stress may not be due to the primary actions of CORT, but instead reflect the emergence of synaptic adaptations as networks seek to re-establish intrinsic activity setpoints.","NA"

Controlled transport of bulky mitochondria is especially important in polarized cells such as neurons that rely on these organelles to locally produce energy and buffer calcium. Mitochondrial transport requires and depends on microtubules which fill much of the available axonal space. How mitochondrial transport is affected by their position within the microtubule bundles is not known. Here, we found that anterograde transport, driven by kinesin motors, is susceptible to the molecular conformation of tubulin both in vitro and in vivo. Anterograde velocities negatively correlate with the density of elongated tubulin dimers, similar to GTP-tubulin, that are more straight and rigid. The impact of the tubulin conformation depends primarily on where a mitochondrion is positioned, either within or at the rim of microtubule bundle. Increasing elongated tubulin levels lowers the number of motile anterograde mitochondria within the microtubule bundle and increases anterograde transport speed at the microtubule bundle rim. We demonstrate that the increased kinesin step processivity on microtubules consisting of elongated dimers underlies increased mitochondrial dynamics. Our work indicates that the molecular conformation of tubulin controls mitochondrial motility and as such locally regulates the distribution of mitochondria along axons.","NA"

Central inhibitory mechanisms, involving serotonin and opioids, are critical to analgesia produced by regular physical activity. The RVM sends projections to the spinal cord to inhibit or facilitate nociceptive neurons and plays a key role in exercise-induced analgesia. The goal of these studies was to examine if regular physical activity modifies RVM-spinal cord circuitry. Male and female mice received Fluoro-Gold placed on the spinal cord to identify spinally projecting neurons from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and the nucleus raphe obscuris/nucleus raphe pallidus (NRO/NRP), dermorphin-488 into caudal medulla to identify mu-opioid receptors, and were immunohistochemically stained for either phosphorylated-N-methyl-D-aspartate subunit NR1 (p-NR1) to identify excitatory neurons or tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) to identify serotonin neurons. The percentage of dermorphin-488-positive cells that stained for p-NR1 (or TPH), and the percentage of dermorphin-488-positive cells that stained for p-NR1 (or TPH) and Fluoro-Gold was calculated.

Physically active animals were provided running wheels in their cages for 8 weeks and compared to sedentary animals without running wheels. Animals with chronic muscle pain, induced by two intramuscular injections of pH 4.0, were compared to sham controls (pH 7.2). Physically active animals had less mu-opioid expressing neurons projecting to the spinal cord when compared to sedentary animals in the RVM, but not the NRO/NRP. No changes were observed for TPH. These data suggest that regular exercise alters central facilitation so that there is less descending facilitation to result in a net increase in inhibition.

Regardless of the experimental context (e.g. background scene, no background scene), or target eccentricity (from 4 to 20 degrees of visual angle), we found that the microsaccade rate dropped to near zero levels within only 12 milliseconds after trial onset. There were almost never any microsaccades before the saccade to the face. One subject completed 118 consecutive trials without a single microsaccade. However, in about 20% of the trials, there was a single corrective microsaccade that occurred almost immediately after the preceding saccades offset. These corrective microsaccades were task oriented because their facial landmark targeting distributions matched those of saccades within both the upright and inverted face conditions.

To move towards explanation, we examine whether sleep quality and quantity are similarly associated with brain changes across the adult lifespan.

MethodsAssociations between self-reported sleep parameters (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;PSQI) and longitudinal cortical change were tested using five samples from the Lifebrain consortium (n=2205, 4363 MRIs, 18-92 years). Analyses were augmented by considering episodic memory change, gene expression from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, and amyloid-beta (A{beta}) accumulation (n=1980).

ResultsPSQI components sleep problems and low sleep quality were related to thinning of the right lateral temporal cortex. The association with sleep problems emerged after 60 years, especially in regions with high expression of genes related to oligodendrocytes and S1 pyramidal neurons. BMI and symptoms of depression had negligible effects. Sleep problems were neither related to longitudinal change in episodic memory function nor to A{beta} accumulation, suggesting that sleep-related cortical changes were independent of AD neuropathology and cognitive decline.

ConclusionWorse self-reported sleep in later adulthood was associated with more cortical thinning in regions of high expression of genes related to oligodendrocytes and S1 pyramidal neurons, but not to A{beta} accumulation or memory decline. The relationship to cortical brain change suggests that self-reported sleep parameters are relevant in lifespan studies, but small effect sizes, except for a few restricted regions, indicate that self-reported sleep is not a good biomarker of general cortical degeneration in healthy older adults.","NA"

Wild type (WT ONA) and Tnc knockout (KO ONA) mice were immunized with an optic nerve antigen (ONA) homogenate and control groups (CO) obtained sodium chloride (WT CO, KO CO). IOP was measured weekly and electroretinographies were recorded at the end of the study. 10 weeks after immunization, we analyzed retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), glial cells and the expression of different cytokines in retina and optic nerve tissue in all four groups.

IOP and retinal function was comparable in all groups. Although less severe in KO ONA, WT and KO mice displayed a significant loss of RGCs after immunization. Compared to KO ONA, a significant reduction of {beta}III-tubulin stained axons and oligodendrocyte markers was noted in the optic nerve of WT ONA. In retinal and optic nerve slices, we found an enhanced GFAP+ staining area of astrocytes in immunized WT. In retinal flat-mounts, a significantly higher number of Iba1+ microglia was found in WT ONA, while a lower number of Iba1+ cells was observed in KO ONA. Furthermore, an increased expression of the glial markers Gfap, Iba1, Nos2 and Cd68 was detected in retinal and optic nerve tissue of WT ONA, whereas comparable levels were observed in KO ONA post immunization. In addition, pro-inflammatory Tnfa expression was upregulated in WT ONA, but downregulated in KO ONA. Vice versa, a significantly increased anti-inflammatory Tgfb expression was measured in KO ONA animals.

Collectively, this study revealed that Tnc plays an important role in glial and inflammatory response during retinal neurodegeneration. Our results provide evidence that Tnc is involved in glaucomatous damage by regulating retinal glial activation and cytokine release.

Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses if added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and here, we show that the addition of heparin (100 g.ml-1) to vero cells inhibits invasion by SARS-CoV-2 by 70%. We also demonstrate that heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain and induces a conformational change, illustrated by surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies. The structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends were investigated using a library of heparin derivatives and size-defined fragments. Binding is more strongly dependent on the presence of 2-O or 6-O sulphation, and the consequent conformational consequences in the heparin structure, than on N-sulphation. A hexasaccharide is required for conformational changes to be induced in the secondary structure that are comparable to those that arise from heparin binding.

In such analyses it is key to determine whether sequences (e.g. genes) from different strains, are the same or different. This is often achieved by clustering orthologous genes based on sequence similarity. Importantly, one limitation of existing pan-genome clustering methods is that they do not assign a confidence score to the identified clusters. Given that clustering ground truth is unavailable when working with pan-genomes, the absence of confidence scores makes performance evaluation on real data an open challenge. Moreover, most pan-genome clustering solutions do not accommodate cluster augmentation, which is the addition of new sequences to an already clustered set of sequences. Finally, the pan-genome size of many organisms prevents direct application of powerful clustering techniques that do not scale to large datasets. Here, we present Boundary-Forest Clustering (BFClust), a method that addresses these challenges in three main steps: 1) The approximate-nearest-neighbor retrieval method Boundary-Forest is used as a representative selection step; 2) Downstream clustering of the representatives is performed using Markov Clustering (MCL); 3) Consensus clustering is applied across the Boundary-Forest, improving clustering accuracy and enabling confidence score calculation. First, MCL is favorably benchmarked against 6 powerful clustering methods. To explore the strengths of the entire BFClust approach, it is applied to 4 different datasets of the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, and compared against 4 other pan-genome clustering tools. Unlike existing approaches, BFClust is fast, accurate, robust to noise and allows augmentation. Moreover, BFClust uniquely identifies low-confidence clusters in each dataset, which can negatively impact downstream analyses and interpretation of pan-genomes. Being the first tool that outputs confidence scores both when clustering de novo, and during cluster augmentation, BFClust offers a way of automatically evaluating and eliminating ambiguity in pan-genomes.

Author SummaryClustering of biological sequences is a critical step in studying bacterial species with large sequence diversity. Existing clustering approaches group sequences together based on similarity. However, these approaches do not offer a way of evaluating the confidence of their output. This makes it impossible to determine whether the clustering output reflect biologically relevant clusters. Most existing methods also do not allow cluster augmentation, which is the quick incorporation and clustering of newly available sequences with an already clustered set. We present Boundary-Forest Clustering (BFClust) as a method that can generate cluster confidence scores, as well as allow cluster augmentation. In addition to having these additional key functionalities and being scalable to large dataset sizes, BFClust matches and outperforms state-of-the-art software in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise and speed. We show on 4 Streptococcus pneumoniae datasets that the confidence scores uniquely generated by BFClust can indeed be used to identify ambiguous sequence clusters. These scores thereby serve as a quality control step before further analysis on the clustering output commences. BFClust is currently the only biological sequence clustering tool that allows augmentation and outputs confidence scores, which should benefit most pan-genome studies.","NA"

Here, we develop a robust CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system by transgenic expression of doxycycline (Dox) inducible dCas9-KRAB in mouse embryonic stem cells (iKRAB ESC). After introduction of specific gRNAs, the induced dCas9-KRAB efficiently maintains gene inactivation, though it exerts modest effects on active gene expression. Proper timing of Dox addition during cell differentiation or reprogramming allows us to study or screen spatiotemporally activated promoters or enhancers and thereby the gene functions. Furthermore, taking the ESC for blastocyst injection, we generate an iKRAB knockin (KI) mouse model that enables shut-down of gene expression and loss-of-function studies ex vivo and in vivo by a simple transduction of gRNAs. Thus, our inducible CRISPRi ESC line and KI mouse provide versatile and convenient platforms for functional interrogation and high-throughput screens of specific genes and potential regulatory elements in the setting of development or diseases.","NA"

Glazier","Indiana University","2020-04-28",1,"cc_by","new results","bioengineering","The COVID-19 crisis has shown that classic sequential models for scientific research are too slow and do not easily encourage multidisciplinary scientific collaboration. The need to rapidly understand the causes of differing infection outcomes and vulnerabilities, to provide mechanistic frameworks for the interpretation of experimental and clinical data and to suggest drug and therapeutic targets and to design optimized personalized interventions all require the development of detailed predictive quantitative models of all aspects of COVID-19. Many of these models will require the use of common submodels describing specific aspects of infection (e.g., viral replication) but combine them in novel configurations. As a contribution to this development and as a proof-of-concept for some components of these models, we present a multi-layered 2D multiscale, multi-cell model and associated computer simulations of the infection of epithelial tissue by a virus, the proliferation and spread of the virus, the cellular immune response and tissue damage. Our initial, proof-of-concept model is built of modular components to allow it to be easily extended and adapted to describe specific viral infections, tissue types and immune responses. Immediately after a cell becomes infected, the virus replicates inside the cell. After an eclipse period, the infected cells start shedding diffusing infectious virus, infecting nearby cells, and secretes a short-diffusing cytokine signal. Neighboring cells can take up the diffusing extracellular virus and become infected. The cytokine signal calls for immune cells from a simple model of the systemic immune response. These immune cells chemotax and activate within the tissue in response to the cytokine profile. Activated immune cells can kill underlying epithelial cells directly or by secreting a short-diffusible toxic chemical. Infected cells can also die by apoptosis due to the stress of viral replication. We do not include direct cytokine mediated protective factors in the tissue or distinguish the complexity of the immune response in this simple model. Despite unrealistically fast viral production and immune response, the current base model allows us to define three parameter regimes, where the immune system rapidly controls the virus, where it controls the virus after extensive tissue damage, and where the virus escapes control and infects and kills all cells. We can simulate a number of drug therapy concepts, like delayed rate of production of viral RNAs, reduced viral entry, and higher and lower levels of immune response, which we demonstrate with simulation results of parameter sweeps of select model parameters. From results of these sweeps, we found that successful containment of infection in simulation directly relates to inhibited viral internalization and rapid immune cell recruitment, while spread of infection occurs in simulations with fast viral internalization and slower immune response. In contrast to other simulations of viral infection, our simulated tissue demonstrates spatial and cellular events of viral infection as resulting from subcellular, cellular, and systemic mechanisms. To support rapid development of current and new submodels, we are developing a shared, publicly available environment to support collaborative development of this framework and its components. We warmly invite interested members of the biological, medical, mathematical and computational communities to contribute to improving and extending the framework.","NA"

Here we perform computational modeling of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA localization across eight subcellular neighborhoods. We compare hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the human transcriptome and other coronaviruses and perform systematic sub-sequence analyses to identify the responsible signals. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models, we predict that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and all sgRNAs are enriched in the host mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus. The 5 and 3 viral untranslated regions possess the strongest and most distinct localization signals.

Bacteriophage infection of starter cultures is one of the biggest causes of fermentation failure and, therefore, lactococcal phages have received great attention from the scientific community in the past decades. In this work we present evidence for the establishment of a carrier state life cycle (CSLC) by a bacteriophage belonging to the c2 species, in the model laboratory strain L. lactis MG1363. Our results show that infection of L. lactis MG1363 with a second, dissimilar, c2 bacteriophage can induce the CSLC phage to enter an active lytic life cycle. The viral progeny obtained after this infection is a mixed population of phages with differences in their genome sequences and host ranges, indicative of an extremely rapid evolution process. We discuss the possible implications of this phage-host interaction, both with respect to bacteriophage evolution and phage adaptation to different hosts.

In proliferative cells, ANRIL prevents cellular senescence by repressing the expression of INK4 genes through Polycomb protein recruitment. Decreased expression of ANRIL in senescence is thought to relieve this repression. Here, we observe in various models of oncogene-induced senescence that senescence induction is accompanied by an increase in ANRIL expression, including the increase of circular ANRIL species. Circular ANRIL species repress p15 gene expression in proliferative cells as previously described for ANRIL. However, in RAF1 oncogene-induced senescent cells, circular ANRIL isoforms are required for full induction of p15, p16 and p14ARF gene expression. They interact with Polycomb group proteins and regulate H3K27me3 at the p16 gene promoter. Hence, we propose a mechanism relying on changes in the ratio between circular ANRIL and Polycomb proteins by which circular ANRIL species switch from being repressors of p15 expression to activators of INK4 gene expression during RAF1-induced senescence.

Here, we report that Nup88 exhibits positive correlation in head and neck cancer in addition to elevated Nup62 levels. We demonstrate that Nup88 interacts with Nup62 in a cell-cycle and glycosylation independent manner. The overexpression of Nup88 or Nup62 imparts proliferation and migration advantages to cells. We further report that the interaction with Nup62 stabilizes Nup88 by inhibiting proteasome-mediated degradation of overexpressed Nup88. Overexpressed Nup88 is stabile and partly inside the nucleus and can interact with NF{kappa}B (p65). Nup88 overexpression induces proliferative and inflammatory responses downstream of p65. Altogether, we suggest that simultaneous overexpression of Nup62 and Nup88 in head and neck cancer stabilizes overexpressed Nup88. Stable Nup88 interacts with p65 and induces inflammatory, proliferative, and migratory advantages to cells, which perhaps is the underlying mechanism driving tumorigenic transformations.","NA"

It provides a wide range of ecosystem services and has been in decline throughout the arid west for the last century. This decline may be explained partially by the lack of fire on the landscape as aspen benefit from fire that eliminates conifer competition and stimulates reproduction through root suckering. Managers are interested in aspen restoration but there is a lack of knowledge about their spatial dynamics in response to fire. Our study area in northeastern California on the Lassen, Modoc and Plumas National Forests has experienced recent large mixed-severity wildfires where aspen was present, providing an opportunity to study the re-introduction of fire. We observed two time periods; a 54-year absence of fire from 1941 to 1993 preceding a 24-year period of wildfire activity from 1993 to 2017. We utilized aerial photos to delineate aspen stand size, location and succession to conifers. We chose aspen stands in areas where wildfires overlapped (twice-burned), where only a single wildfire burned, and areas that did not burn within the recent 24-year period. We looked at these same stands within the first period of fire exclusion for comparison (i.e., 1941-1993). In the absence of fire, all aspen stand areas declined and all stands experienced increases in conifer composition. After wildfire, stands that burned experienced a release from conifer competition and increased in stand area. Stands that burned twice or at high severity experienced a larger removal of conifer competition than stands that burned once at low severity, promoting aspen recovery and expansion. Stands with less edge:area ratio also expanded more with fire present. Across both time periods, stand movement, where aspen stand footprints were mostly in new areas compared to footprints of previous years, was highest in smaller stands. In the fire exclusion period, smaller stands exhibited greater changes in area and location (movement), highlighting their vulnerability to loss in the absence of disturbances that provide adequate growing space for aspen over time.","NA"

Movie output also allows for computational correction of specimen movement and compensation for radiation damage. However, these movies come at the cost of producing large volumes of data. It is common practice to sum groups of successive camera frames to reduce the final frame rate, and therefore file size, to one suitable for storage and image processing. This reduction in the cameras temporal resolution requires decisions to be made during data acquisition that may result in the loss of information that could have been advantageous during image analysis.

This format enables recording of DDD movies at the raw camera frame rate without sacrificing either spatial or temporal resolution. Experimental data demonstrate that the method retains super-resolution information and allows correction of specimen movement at the physical frame rate of the camera while maintaining manageable file sizes.

The inner membrane contains folds called cristae, which increase the membrane surface and thus the amount of membrane-bound proteins necessary for the OXPHOS. These folds have been of great interest not only because of their importance for energy conversion, but also because changes in morphology have been linked to a broad range of diseases from cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, to ageing and infection. With a distance between opposing cristae membranes often below 100 nm, conventional fluorescence imaging cannot provide a resolution sufficient for resolving these structures. For this reason, various highly specialized super-resolution methods including dSTORM, PALM, STED and SIM have been applied for cristae visualisation.

Expansion Microscopy (ExM) offers the possibility to perform super-resolution microscopy on conventional confocal microscopes by embedding the sample into a swellable hydrogel that is isotropically expanded by a factor of 4-4.5, improving the resolution to 60-70 nm on conventional confocal microscopes, which can be further increased to [~] 30 nm laterally using SIM. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of the mitochondrial creatine kinase MtCK linked to marker protein GFP (MtCK-GFP), which localizes to the space between the outer and the inner mitochondrial membrane, can be used as a cristae marker.

Here, we identify a role for the PBAF (Polybromo - Brg1 Associated Factor) complex in the regulation of meiotic cell division. The germ cell-specific depletion of PBAF specific subunit, ARID2 resulted in a metaphase-I arrest. Arid2cKO metaphase-I spermatocytes displayed defects in chromosome organization and spindle assembly. Additionally, mutant centromeres were devoid of Polo-like kinase1 (PLK1), a known regulator of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)2. The loss of PLK1 coincided with an abnormal chromosome-wide expansion of centromeric chromatin modifications such as Histone H3 threonine3 phosphorylation (H3T3P) and Histone H2A threonine120 phosphorylation (H2AT120P) that are critical for chromosome segregation3,4.

We have previously shown that oxidative stress induces myocardial senescence, promoting adverse myocardial remodeling and cardiac dysfunction via the expression of a proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In this study we hypothesized that oxidative stress-induced senescence and SASP-mediated inflammation contribute to the pathophysiology of cardiac IRI and thus, senescence represents a novel therapeutic target.

ObjectiveTo identify if cellular senescence contributes to the pathophysiology of IRI and to investigate if pharmacological elimination of senescent cells after ischemia-reperfusion can improve cardiac outcomes.

Methods and ResultsUsing an established model of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, we demonstrate that in young mice IRI induces cellular senescence in both cardiomyocytes and interstitial cell populations. Additionally, we show that treatment with the senolytic drug navitoclax improves left ventricular function, increases myocardial vascularization, and decreases scar size. SWATH-MS based proteomics revealed that biological processes associated with fibrosis and inflammation, which were increased following ischemia-reperfusion, were attenuated upon senescent cell clearance. Furthermore, navitoclax treatment reduced the expression of proinflammatory, profibrotic and anti-angiogenic cytokines, including interferon gamma-induced protein-10, TGF-{beta}3, interleukin-11, interleukin-16 and fractalkine.

ConclusionsOur study provides proof-of-concept evidence that cellular senescence contributes to impaired heart function and adverse remodeling following cardiac ischemia-reperfusion. We also establish that post-IRI the SASP plays a considerable role in the inflammatory response. Subsequently, senolytic treatment, at a clinically feasible time point, attenuates multiple components of this response and improves clinically important parameters. Thus, cellular senescence represents a potential novel therapeutic avenue to improve patient outcomes following cardiac ischemia-reperfusion.","NA"

Two contrasting hypotheses have been put forward to explain how species interactions could influence diversity.  Ecological Controls (EC) predicts a negative relationship, where the evolution or migration of novel types is constrained as available niches become filled. In contrast,  Diversity Begets Diversity (DBD) predicts a positive relationship, with existing diversity promoting the accumulation of further diversity via niche construction and other interactions. Using the Earth Microbiome Project, the largest standardized survey of global biodiversity to date, we provide evidence that DBD is strongest in less diverse biomes, such as the animal gut, but weaker in more diverse biomes, such as soil, presumably because most available niches are filled. Also consistent with niche adaptation, resident genera that are strongly specialized for a particular environment show a stronger DBD relationship than do generalists or migrants from another environment. In contrast with the Black Queen Hypothesis that predicts a negative correlation between genome size and community metabolic interactions, we find that genera with larger genomes exhibit a stronger DBD response, which could be due to a higher potential for interactions and niche construction offered by more diverse gene repertoires. Our results highlight the importance of species interactions in shaping microbiome diversity, and the need to account for such interactions in the study of microbial genomes, physiology, and ecological function.","NA"

Existing DNA methylation clocks are highly accurate in blood but are less precise when used in older samples or on brain tissue. We aimed to develop a novel epigenetic clock that performs optimally in human cortex tissue and has the potential to identify phenotypes associated with biological ageing in the brain. We generated an extensive dataset of human cortex DNA methylation data spanning the life-course (n = 1,397, ages = 1 to 104 years). This dataset was split into  training and  testing samples (training: n = 1,047; testing: n = 350). DNA methylation age estimators were derived using a transformed version of chronological age on DNA methylation at specific sites using elastic net regression, a supervised machine learning method. The cortical clock was subsequently validated in a novel human cortex dataset (n = 1,221, ages = 41 to 104 years) and tested for specificity in a large whole blood dataset (n = 1,175, ages = 28 to 98 years). We identified a set of 347 DNA methylation sites that, in combination optimally predict age in the human cortex. The sum of DNA methylation levels at these sites weighted by their regression coefficients provide the cortical DNA methylation clock age estimate. The novel clock dramatically out-performed previously reported clocks in additional cortical datasets. Our findings suggest that previous associations between predicted DNA methylation age and neurodegenerative phenotypes might represent false positives resulting from clocks not robustly calibrated to the tissue being tested and for phenotypes that become manifest in older ages. The age distribution and tissue type of samples included in training datasets need to be considered when building and applying epigenetic clock algorithms to human epidemiological or disease cohorts.","NA"

Suppression of GLO1 was sufficient to reduce compatibility, and overexpression of GLO1 in self-incompatible Brassica napus stigmas resulted in partial breakdown of the self-incompatibility response. Here, we verified if BnGLO1 could function as a compatibility factor in the artificial self-incompatibility system of Arabidopsis thaliana expressing AlSCRb, AlSRKb and AlARC1 proteins from A. lyrata. Overexpression of BnGLO1 is sufficient to breakdown self-incompatibility response in A. thaliana stigmas, suggesting that GLO1 functions as an inter-species compatibility factor. Therefore, GLO1 has an indisputable role as a compatibility factor in the stigma in regulating pollen attachment and pollen tube growth. Lastly, this study demonstrates the usefulness of an artificial self-incompatibility system in A. thaliana for interspecific self-incompatibility studies.","NA"

Mass spectrometry (MS) profiling of eluted HLA ligands, which provides high-throughput measurements of HLA associated peptides in vivo, can be used to faithfully model the presentation of epitopes on the cell surface. In addition, gene expression profiles measured by RNA-seq data in a specific cell/tissue type can significantly improve the performance of epitope presentation prediction. However, although large amount of high-quality MS data of HLA-bound peptides is being generated in recent years, few provide matching RNA-seq data, which makes incorporating gene expression into epitope prediction difficult.

MethodsWe collected publicly available HLA peptidome and matching RNA-seq data of 34 cell lines derived from various sources. We built position score specific matrixes (PSSMs) for 21 HLA-I alleles based on these MS data, then used logistic regression (LR) to model the relationship among PSSM score, gene expression and peptide length to predict whether a peptide could be presented in each of the cell line. We further built a universal LR model, termed Epitope Presentation Integrated Prediction (EPIP), based on more than 180,000 unique HLA ligands collected from public sources and ~3,000 HLA ligands generated by ourselves, to predict epitope presentation for 66 common HLA-I alleles.

ResultsWhen evaluating EPIP on large, independent HLA eluted ligand datasets, it performed substantially better than other popular methods, including MixMHCpred (v2.0), NetMHCpan (v4.0), and MHCflurry (v1.2.2), with an average 0.1% positive predictive value (PPV) of 52.01%, compared to 37.24%, 36.96%, 24.90% and 23.76% achieved by MixMHCpred, NetMHCpan-4.0 (EL), NetMHCpan-4.0 (BA) and MHCflurry, respectively. It is also comparable to EDGE, a recent deep learning-based model that is not publicly available, on predicting epitope presentation and selecting immunogenic cancer neoantigens. However, the simplicity and flexibility of EPIP makes it easier to be applied in diverse situations, and we demonstrated this by generating MS data for the HCC4006 cell line and adding the support of HLA-A*33:03 to EPIP. EPIP is publicly available at <http://epip.genomics.cn/>.

Conclusionswe have developed an easy to use, publicly available epitope prediction tool, EPIP, that incorporates information from both MS and RNA-seq data, and demonstrated its superior performance over existing public methods.","NA"

Indexing billions of k-mers is promptly a scalability problem, as exact associative indexes can be memory expensive. Recent works take advantage of the properties of the k-mer sets to leverage this challenge. They exploit the overlaps shared among k-mers by using a de Bruijn graph as a compact k-mer set to provide lightweight structures.

ResultsWe present Blight, a static and exact index structure able to associate unique identifiers to indexed k-mers and to reject alien k-mers that scales to the largest kmer sets with a low memory cost. The proposed index combines an extremely compact representation along with very high throughput. Besides, its construction from the de Bruijn graph sequences is efficient and does not need supplementary memory. The efficient index implementation achieves to index the k-mers from the human genome with 8GB within 10 minutes and can scale up to the large axolotl genome with 63 GB within 76 minutes. Furthermore, while being memory efficient, the index allows above a million queries per second on a single CPU in our experiments, and the use of multiple cores raises its throughput. Finally, we also present how the index can practically represent metagenomic and transcriptomic sequencing data to highlight its wide applicative range.

To identify these rhythms, biological samples are taken over circadian time and analyzed using a single omics type, such as transcriptomics or proteomics. By comparing data from these single omics approaches, it has been shown that transcriptional rhythms are not necessarily conserved at the protein level, implying extensive circadian post-transcriptional regulation. However, as proteomics methods are known to be noisier than transcriptomic methods, this suggests that previously identified arrhythmic proteins with rhythmic transcripts could have been missed due to noise and may not be due to post-transcriptional regulation.

ResultsTo determine if one can use information from less-noisy transcriptomic data to inform rhythms in more-noisy proteomic data, and thus more accurately identify rhythms in the proteome, we have created the MOSAIC (Multi-Omics Selection with Amplitude Independent Criteria) application. MOSAIC combines model selection and joint modeling of multiple omics types to recover significant circadian and non-circadian trends. Using both synthetic data and proteomic data from Neurospora crassa, we showed that MOSAIC accurately recovers circadian rhythms at higher rates in not only the proteome but the transcriptome as well, outperforming existing methods for rhythm identification. In addition, by quantifying non-circadian trends in addition to circadian trends in data, our methodology allowed for the recognition of the diversity of circadian regulation as compared to non-circadian regulation.

Motivated by fine-mapping of the microbiome, we propose a two-step compositional knockoff filter (CKF) to provide the effective finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control in high-dimensional linear log-contrast regression analysis of microbiome compositional data. In the first step, we employ the compositional screening procedure to remove insignificant microbial taxa while retaining the essential sum-to-zero constraint. In the second step, we extend the knockoff filter to identify the significant microbial taxa in the sparse regression model for compositional data. Thereby, a subset of the microbes is selected from the high-dimensional microbial taxa as related to the response using a pre-specified FDR threshold. We study the asymptotic properties of the proposed two-step procedure, including both sure screening and effective false discovery control. We demonstrate the finite-sample properties in simulation studies, which show the gain in the empirical power while controlling the nominal FDR. The potential usefulness of the proposed method is also illustrated with application to an inflammatory bowel disease dataset to identify microbial taxa that influence host gene expressions.","NA"

Knowing the microbial composition of a site is therefore relevant to improving productivity or health. However, sequencing facilities are not always available, or may be prohibitively expensive in some cases. Thus, it would be desirable to computationally predict the microbial composition from more accessible, easily-measured features.

ResultsIntegrating Deep Learning techniques with microbiome data, we propose an artificial neural network architecture based on heterogeneous autoencoders to condense the long vector of microbial abundance values into a deep latent space representation. Then, we design a model to predict the deep latent space and, consequently, to predict the complete microbial composition using environmental features as input. The performance of our system is examined using the rhizosphere microbiome of Maize. We reconstruct the microbial composition (717 taxa) from the deep latent space (10 values) with high fidelity ({inverted question}0.9 Pearson correlation). We then successfully predict microbial composition from environmental variables such as plant age, temperature or precipitation (0.73 Pearson correlation, 0.42 Bray-Curtis). We extend this to predict microbiome composition under hypothetical scenarios, such as future climate change conditions. Finally, via transfer learning, we predict microbial composition in a distinct scenario with only a hundred sequences, and distinct environmental features. We propose that our deep latent space may assist microbiome-engineering strategies when technical or financial resources are limited, through predicting current or future microbiome compositions.

The extent to which developmentally regulated lncRNAs are translated and whether the produced microproteins are relevant for human development is unknown. Here, we show that many lncRNAs in direct vicinity of lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) are dynamically regulated, predominantly cytosolic, and highly translated during pancreas development. We genetically ablated ten such lncRNAs, most of them translated, and found that nine are dispensable for endocrine cell differentiation. However, deletion of LINC00261 diminishes generation of insulin+ endocrine cells, in a manner independent of the nearby TF FOXA2. Systematic deletion of each of LINC00261s seven poorly conserved microproteins shows that the RNA, rather than the microproteins, is required for endocrine development. Our work highlights extensive translation of lncRNAs into recently evolved microproteins during human pancreas development and provides a blueprint for dissection of their coding and noncoding roles.

Here, we developed a data-driven, reproducible geospatial workflow to map species distributions and evaluate their conservation status consistent with the guidelines and criteria of the IUCN Red List. Our workflow follows five automated steps to refine the distribution of a species starting from its Extent of Occurrence (EOO) to Area of Habitat (AOH) within the species range. The ranges are produced with an Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation procedure, using presence and absence points derived from primary biodiversity data. As a case-study, we mapped the distribution of 2,273 bird species in the Americas, 55% of all terrestrial birds found in the region. We then compared our produced species ranges to the expert-drawn IUCN/BirdLife range maps and conducted a preliminary IUCN extinction risk assessment based on criterion B (Geographic Range). We found that our workflow generated ranges with fewer errors of omission, commission, and a better overall accuracy within each species EOO. The spatial overlap between both datasets was low (28%) and the expert-drawn range maps were consistently larger due to errors of commission. Their estimated Area of Habitat (AOH) was also larger for a subset of 741 forest-dependent birds. We found that incorporating geospatial data increased the number of threatened species by 52% in comparison to the 2019 IUCN Red List. Furthermore, 103 species could be placed in threatened categories (VU, EN, CR) pending further assessment. The implementation of our geospatial workflow provides a valuable alternative to increase the transparency and reliability of species risk assessments and improve mapping species distributions for conservation planning and decision-making.","NA"

The advantage of COI is its taxonomic resolution and the availability of an extensive reference database. However, when universal primers are used on environmental DNA (eDNA) isolated from stream water, macroinvertebrate read and OTU numbers are typically ""watered down"", i.e. diluted, compared to whole specimen  bulk samples due to greater co-amplification of abundant non-target taxa such as algae and bacteria. Because stream macroinvertebrate taxa are of prime importance for regulatory biomonitoring, more effective ways to capture their diversity via eDNA isolated from water are important. In this study, we aimed to improve macroinvertebrate assessment from eDNA by minimizing non-target amplification. Therefore, we generated data using universal primers BF2/BR2 throughout 15 months from a German Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, the River Kinzig, to identify most abundant non-target taxa. Based on these data, we designed a new reverse primer (EPTDr2n) with 3-specificity towards macrozoobenthic taxa and validated its specificity in silico together with universal forward primer fwhF2 using available data from GenBank and BOLD. We then performed in vitro tests using 20 eDNA samples taken in the Kinzig catchment. We found that the percentage of target reads was much higher for the new primer combination compared to two universal macrozoobenthic primer pairs, BF2/BR2 and fwhF2/fwhR2n (>99 % vs. 21.4 % and 41.25 %, respectively). Likewise, number of detected macroinvertebrate taxa was substantially higher (351 vs. 46 and 170, respectively) and exceeded the number of 257 taxa identified by expert taxonomists at nearby sites across two decades of sampling. While few taxa such as Turbellaria were not detected, we show that the optimized primer avoids the dilution problem and thus significantly improves macroinvertebrate detection for bioassessment and -monitoring.","NA"

Sequencing their genomes and conducting comparative bioinformatic analyses showed that these genomes had substantial phylogenetic diversity. We examined each diazotroph genome for the presence of nif genes essential to nitrogen fixation (nifHDKENB) and carbohydrate utilization genes relevant to the mucilage polysaccharide digestion. These analyses identified diazotrophs that possessed canonical nif gene operons, as well as many other operon configurations with concomitant fixation and release of >700 different 15N labeled metabolites. We further demonstrated that many diazotrophs possessed alternative nif gene operons and confirmed their genomic potential to derive chemical energy from mucilage polysaccharide to fuel nitrogen fixation.

Here we show that 670nm restores immunocompetence, improving hemocyte counts and hemolymph anti-microbial action. Additionally, we measure whole body respiration in vivo in individual bumblebees revealing that it is a functional metric of both neonicotinoid impact and light induced mitochondrial protection.

For example, research has demonstrated that fMRI activity is more complex before than after consumption of alcohol and during task than resting state. The measurement of H in fMRI is a novel method that requires the investigation of additional factors contributing to complexity. Graph theory metrics of centrality can assess how centrally important to the brain network each region is, based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) counts of probabilistic white matter (WM) tracts. DTI derived centrality was hypothesized to account for the complexity of functional activity, based on the supposition that more sources of information to integrate should result in more complex activity. FMRI BOLD complexity as measured by H was associated with five brain region centrality measures: degree, eigenvector, PageRank, current flow betweenness, and current flow closeness centrality. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that degree centrality was the most robust predictor of complexity, whereby greater centrality was associated with increased complexity (lower H). Regions known to be highly connected, including the thalamus and hippocampus, notably were among the highest in centrality and complexity. This research has led to a greater understanding of how brain region characteristics such as DTI centrality relate to the novel Hurst exponent approach for assessing brain activity complexity, and implications for future research that employ these measures are discussed.","NA"

No changes in {beta}-adrenergic sensitivity or oxidative metabolism were observed; instead, 14-3-3{zeta} over-expression significantly decreased thermal conductance via increased peripheral vasoconstriction. These findings suggest 14-3-3{zeta} mediates alternative, non-thermogenic mechanisms to mitigate heat loss for homeothermy. Our results point to an unexpected role of 14-3-3{zeta} in the regulation of body temperature.

Comparison among related plant species showed that a chalcone synthase-like (CHS-L) gene family has lineage-specifically and rapidly expanded in S. tora. Combining genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and biochemistry, we identified a CHS-L responsible for biosynthesis of anthraquinones, the first example in plants. The S. tora reference genome will accelerate the discovery of biologically active anthraquinone biosynthesis pathways in medicinal plants.

Many machine learning-based methods, including deep learning and random forest, have been developed and widely used to alleviate some analytic challenges in complex human disease studies. While enjoying the modeling flexibility and robustness, these model frameworks suffer from non-transparency and difficulty in interpreting the role of each individual feature due to their intrinsic black-box natures. However, identifying important biomarkers associated with complex human diseases is a critical pursuit towards assisting researchers to establish novel hypotheses regarding prevention, diagnosis and treatment of complex human diseases. Herein, we propose a Permutation-based Feature Importance Test (PermFIT) for estimating and testing the feature importance, and for assisting interpretation of individual feature in various black-box frameworks, including deep neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines. PermFIT (available at https://github.com/SkadiEye/deepTL) is implemented in a computationally efficient manner, without model refitting for each permuted data. We conduct extensive numerical studies under various scenarios, and show that PermFIT not only yields valid statistical inference, but also helps to improve the prediction accuracy of black-box models with top selected features. With the application to the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) kidney tumor data and the HITChip atlas BMI data, PermFIT clearly demonstrates its practical usage in identifying important biomarkers and boosting performance of black-box predictive models.","NA"

Here, by combining real time cellular growth data with mathematical modeling, we showed that the cisplatin-sensitive and tolerant lung cancer cells when co-cultured in cisplatin-free and cisplatin-treated environments, exhibit drastically different group strategies in response to environmental changes. While tolerant cells exhibited a persister-like behaviour and were attenuated by sensitive cells, sensitive cells  learned to evade chemotherapy from tolerant cells when co-cultured. Further, tolerant cells could switch phenotypes to become sensitive, although high cisplatin concentrations suppressed this switching. Finally, switching cisplatin administration from continuous to intermittent suppressed the emergence of tolerant cells, suggesting that intermittent rather than continuous chemotherapy may result in better outcomes in lung cancer.","NA"

However, their determination remains elusive, invoking an urgent need for predictive models that seamlessly integrate metabolic details with ecological and evolutionary principles which shape the interactions within microbial communities. Inspired by the evolutionary game theory, we formulated a bi-level optimization framework termed NECom for the prediction of Nash equilibria of microbial community metabolic models with significantly enhanced accuracy. NECom is free of a long hidden  forced altruism setup in previous static algorithm while allowing for  sensing and responding between microbial members that is missing in dynamic methods. We successfully predicted several classical games in the context of metabolic interactions that were falsely or incompletely predicted by existing methods, including prisoners dilemma, snowdrift game and mutualism. The results provided insights into why mutualism is favorable despite seemingly costly cross-feeding metabolites, and demonstrated the potential to predict heterogeneous phenotypes among the same species. NECom was then applied to a reported algae-yeast co-culture system that shares typical cross-feeding features of lichen, a model system of mutualism. More than 1200 growth conditions were simulated, of which 488 conditions correspond to 3221 experimental data points. Without fitting any ad-hoc parameters, an overall 63.5% and 81.7% reduction in root-mean-square error in predicted growth rates for the two species respectively was achieved when compared with the standard flux balance analysis. The simulation results further show that growth-limiting crossfeeding metabolites can be pinpointed by shadow price analysis to explain the predicted frequency-dependent growth pattern, offering insights into how stabilizing microbial interactions control microbial populations.","NA"

We analysed postnatal expansion, maturation and functionality of peripheral blood MR1T cells in cohorts from three different geographic settings with different tuberculosis (TB) vaccination practices, levels of exposure to and infection with M. tuberculosis. Early after birth, frequencies of MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer-defined MR1T cells increased rapidly by several fold. This coincided with marked phenotypic changes, from a predominantly CD4+ and TRAV1-2- phenotype in neonates, to predominantly TRAV1-2+CD8+ MR1T cells that also expressed CD26 and CD161. We also observed that tetramer+ MR1T cells that expressed TNF upon mycobacterial stimulation were very low in neonates, but increased [~]10-fold in the first year of life. These functional MR1T cells in all age groups were MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer+, TRAV1-2+ cells and expressed CD26 and CD161, markers that appeared to signal phenotypic and functional maturation of this cell subset. This age-associated maturation was also marked by the loss of naive T cell markers on tetramer+ TRAV1-2+ MR1T cells more rapidly than tetramer+TRAV1-2- MR1T cells and non-MR1T cells. These data suggest that neonates have infrequent populations of MR1T cells with diverse phenotypic attributes; and that exposure to the environment rapidly and preferentially expands the MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer+TRAV1-2+ population of MR1T cells, which becomes the predominant population of functional MR1T cells early during childhood.","NA"

The use of this technology requires rigorous validation - from field sampling to interpretation of PCR-based results - for meaningful application and interpretation. Assays targeting eDNA released by individual species are typically validated with no predefined criteria to answer specific research questions in one ecosystem. Their general applicability, uncertainties and limitations often remain undetermined. The absence of clear guidelines prevents targeted eDNA assays from being incorporated into species monitoring and policy, thus their establishment will be key for the future implementation of eDNA-based surveys.
C_LIO_LIWe describe the measures and tests necessary for successful validation of targeted eDNA assays and the associated pitfalls to form the basis of guidelines. A list of 122 variables was compiled and consolidated into a scale to assess the validation status of individual assays. These variables were evaluated for 546 published single-species assays. The resulting dataset was used to provide an overview of current validation practices and test the applicability of the validation scale for future assay rating.
C_LIO_LIThe 122 variables representing assay validation status were classified into 14 thematic blocks, such as ""in silico analysis"", and arranged on a 5-level validation scale from ""incomplete"" to ""operational"". Additionally, minimum validation criteria were defined for each level. The majority (30%) of investigated assays were classified as Level 1 (incomplete), and 15% did not achieve this first level. These assays were characterised by minimal in silico and in vitro testing, but their share in annually published eDNA assays has declined since 2014. The total number of reported variables ranged from 20% to 76% and deviated both between and within levels.
C_LIO_LIThe meta-analysis demonstrates the suitability of the 5-level validation scale for assessing targeted eDNA assays. It is a user-friendly tool to evaluate previously published assays for future research and routine monitoring, while also enabling appropriate interpretation of results. Finally, it provides guidance on validation and reporting standards for newly developed assays.

How can such single-dimensional preference relationships refer to multi-component choice options? Here, we measured how stochastic choices revealed preferences for two-component milkshakes. The preferences were intuitively graphed as indifference curves that represented the orderly integration of the two components as trade-off: parts of one component were given up for obtaining one additional unit of the other component without a change in preference. The well-ordered, non-overlapping curves satisfied leave-one-out tests, followed predictions by machine learning decoders and correlated with single-dimensional Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction-like bids for the two-component rewards. This accuracy suggests a decision process that integrates multiple reward components into single-dimensional estimates in a systematic fashion. In inter-species comparisons, human performance matched that of highly experienced laboratory monkeys, as measured by accuracy of the critical trade-off between bundle components. These data describe the nature of choices of multi-component choice options and attest to the validity of the rigorous economic concepts and their convenient graphic schemes for explaining choices of human and non-human primates.

These interactions resulted in modulation of Src signaling following B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation and subsequent alteration of the protein levels of CD19, a membrane-localized BCR co-receptor and emerging key protein affecting the development of B- and plasma cell-lymphoma. Strikingly, manipulating c-Fes expression levels drove opposing biological outcomes. Low-level exogenous c-Fes expression led to a strong increase in CD19 protein levels while high c-Fes expression abolished CD19 protein levels.

Two examples of such facilitative processes are intraspecific competition and spatial self-organisation. A classical example of an ecosystem governed by the latter is dryland vegetation patterns. Previous theoretical investigations have explained coexistence in patterned vegetation by making strong assumptions on the differences between species (e.g. contrasting dispersal behaviours or different functional responses to soil moisture). In this paper, I show that the interplay between the competitive effects of intraspecific competition and the facilitative nature of self-organisation forms a coexistence mechanism that does not rely on species-specific assumptions. I use an ecohydrological reaction-advection-diffusion system that captures the interactions of two plant species with an explicitly modelled resource to show that coexistence relies on a balance between species colonisation abilities and their local competitiveness, provided intraspecific competition is sufficiently strong. Crucially, the requirements on species self-limitation for coexistence to occur differ on opposite ends of the precipitation (resource input) spectrum. For low resource levels, coexistence is facilitated by strong intraspecific dynamics of the species superior in its colonisation abilities, but for larger volumes of resource input, strong intraspecific competition of the locally superior species enables coexistence. Results presented in this paper also capture the empirically observed spatial species distribution within bands of vegetation and propose differences in plants dispersal behaviour as its cause.","NA"

To begin exploring the genetic basis of C. glabrata virulence and its innate resistance to antifungals, we launched the Hermes transposon from a plasmid and obtained more than 500,000 different semi-random insertions throughout the genome. Using machine learning, we identify up to 1278 protein-encoding genes (25% of total) that cannot tolerate transposon insertions and are thus essential for C. glabrata fitness in vitro. Interestingly, genes involved in mRNA splicing were less likely to be essential in C. glabrata than their orthologs in S. cerevisiae, whereas the opposite is true for genes involved in kinetochore function and chromosome segregation. Insertions in several known genes (e.g. PDR1, CDR1, PDR16, PDR17, UPC2A, DAP1) caused hypersensitivity to the first-line antifungal fluconazole, and we identify 12 additional genes that also contribute to innate fluconazole resistance (KGD1, KGD2, YHR045W, etc). Insertions in 200 other genes conferred significant resistance to fluconazole, two-thirds of which function in mitochondria and likely down-regulate Pdr1 expression or function. These findings show the utility of transposon insertion profiling in genome-wide forward-genetic investigations of fungal pathogens.

IMPORTANCEPathogenic yeasts cause mucosal and systemic infections in millions of people each year. The innate resistance of Candida glabrata to fluconazole and its ability to acquire resistance to 2 other antifungals are contributing to its rise in incidence. Our understanding of C. glabrata biology has been hampered by inefficient genetic and genomic tools. This study addresses those deficiencies by developing powerful transposon mutagenesis strategies for the first time in this pathogen. We identify nearly all essential genes of C. glabrata that could be targeted for development of new antifungals. We generate large pools of random insertion mutants that can be easily monitored en masse with deep sequencing, thus enabling identification of genes involved in any number of biological processes. We identify dozens of new genes that increase or decrease innate resistance of clinical isolate BG2 to fluconazole and provide resources for further exploration of C. glabrata genetics and genomics.","NA"

The critical task is to rapidly identify bacterial pneumonia to enable appropriate antibiotic treatment, ideally at point of care. Current diagnostic tests are insufficient and there is a need for the discovery and development of new tools. Here we report the identification of a unique biomarker signature that can be identified in blood samples.

METHODSBlood samples from 195 pediatric Mozambican patients with clinical pneumonia were analyzed with an aptamer-based high dynamic range assay to quantify [~]1200 proteins. For discovery of new biomarkers, we identified a training set of patient samples in which the underlying etiology of the pneumonia was established as bacterial, viral or malaria. Proteins whose abundances varied significantly between patients with verified etiologies (FDR<0.01) formed the basis for predictive diagnostic models that were created using machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Elastic Net). These models were validated on a dedicated test set of samples.

RESULTS219 proteins had significantly different abundances between bacterial and viral infections, and 151 differed between bacterial infections and a mixed pool of viral and malaria infections. Predictive diagnostic models achieved >90% sensitivity and >80% specificity, regardless of whether one or two pathogen classes were present. Bacterial pneumonia was strongly associated with markers of neutrophil activity, in particular neutrophil degranulation. Degranulation markers included HP, LCN2, LTF, MPO, MMP8, PGLYRP1, RETN, SERPINA1, S100A9, and SLPI.

CONCLUSIONBlood protein signatures highly associated with neutrophil biology reliably differentiated bacterial pneumonia from other causes. With appropriate technology, these markers could provide the basis for a rapid diagnostic for field-based triage for antibiotic treatment of pediatric pneumonia.","NA"

The L184F mutation disrupted the intramolecular interaction, stabilizing the trimer apex thereby leading to viral escape from autologous plasma bnAbs and known bnAbs, targeting exclusively the N160 glycan at trimer apex and not any other known epitope. The L184F amino acid change led to acquisition of a relatively open trimeric configuration, often associated with tier 1 HIV-1 isolates and an increased susceptibility to neutralization by polyclonal plasma antibodies of weak neutralizers. While there was no impact of the L184F mutation on free virus transmission, a reduction in cell-to-cell transmission was observed. In conclusion, we report a viral escape mutation that plausibly destabilized the trimer apex and favoured evasion from broadly neutralizing antibodies. Such mutations, though rare, should be taken into consideration while designing an immunogen, based on a stable correctly-folded HIV-1 Env trimer.

ImportanceDesign of HIV-1 envelope-based immunogens, capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), are currently under active research. Some of the most potent bnAbs target the quaternary epitope at the V2 apex of HIV-1 Env trimer. By studying naturally circulating viruses from an HIV-1 perinatally infected infant, with plasma neutralizing antibodies targeted to the V2-apex, we identified a rare leucine to phenylalanine substitution in two out of six functional viral clones, that destabilized the trimer apex. This single amino acid alteration impaired the interprotomeric interactions that stabilize the trimer apex, resulting in an open trimer conformation, and escape from broadly neutralizing autologous plasma antibodies and known V2-apex directed bnAbs, thereby favouring viral evasion of the early bnAb response of the infected host. Defining the mechanisms by which viral mutations influence the sensitivity of HIV-1 to bnAbs is crucial for the development of effective vaccines against HIV-1 infection.","NA"

Severe storms, which are increasing with global climate change, generate massive inputs of runoff over short timescales (hours to days); such runoff impacted offshore reefs in the northwest Gulf of Mexico (NW GoM) following severe storms in 2016 and 2017. Several weeks after coastal flooding from these events, NW GoM reefs experienced mortality (2016 only) and/or sub-lethal stress (both years). To assess the impact of storm-derived runoff on reef filter feeders, we characterized the microbiomes of two sponges, Agelas clathrodes and Xestospongia muta, during periods of lethal stress, sub-lethal stress, and no stress over a three-year period (2016-2018). Increased anaerobes during lethal stress indicate hypoxic conditions were associated with the 2016 mortality event. Additionally, we found evidence of wastewater contamination (based on 16S libraries and quantitative PCR) in sponges 185 km offshore following storms (2016 and 2017), but not during the non-flooding year (2018). We show that water quality changes following severe storms can impact offshore benthic organisms, highlighting the need for molecular and microbial time series from near- and offshore reef ecosystems, and for the continued mitigation of stormwater runoff and climate change impacts.

Originality-Significance StatementStressors associated with terrestrial runoff have contributed to substantial population declines in nearshore marine ecosystems worldwide over the last three decades. It has been assumed that offshore marine ecosystems (>100 km from land) are largely unaffected by terrestrial runoff. Our findings, however, suggest that flooding events can significantly impact offshore marine organisms, based on the detection of shifted microbiomes and human pathogens in offshore sponges after extreme storm events across two separate years, and lack of detection in a non-flooding year.","NA"

Gene expression profiles, especially with regards to the interactive influence of genes within the expression profiles underlying pathological brain phenotypes associated with mood disorders remains largely undefined.

MethodsBecause the anterior insula is reduced in volume in patients with mood disorders, RNA was extracted from postmortem mood disorder samples and compared with unaffected control samples for RNA-sequencing identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in a) bipolar disorder (BD; n=37), and b) major depressive disorder (MDD n=30) vs controls (n=33), and c) low vs high Axis-I comorbidity (a measure of psychiatric morbidity burden). Given the regulatory role of transcription factors (TFs) in gene expression via specific-DNA-binding domains (motifs), we used JASPAR TF binding database to identify TF-motifs.

ResultsWe found that DEGs in BD-vs-controls, MDD-vs-controls, and high-vs-low Axis-I comorbidity burden were associated with TF-motifs known to regulate expression of toll-like receptor signaling genes, cellular homeostatic-control genes, and genes involved in embryonic, cellular, organ and brain developmental processes.

DiscussionRobust image-guided transcriptomics was applied by targeting the gray matter volume reduction in the anterior insula in mood disorders, to guide independent postmortem identification of TF motifs regulating DEG. TF motifs were identified for immune, cellular, embryonic and neurodevelopmental processes.

ConclusionOur results provided novel information about the hierarchical relationship between gene regulatory networks, the TFs that control them, and proximate underlying neuroanatomical phenotypes in mood disorders.","NA"

Although the involvement of the jacalin domain-containing protein, OsSalT, has been reported in drought and salinity tolerance, its functional mechanism still remains largely unexplored. In this study, expression of the OsSalT gene was found to be positively correlated with the drought tolerance potential with its higher transcript abundance in the tolerant indica rice cultivar, Vandana and lower abundance in the susceptible cultivar, MTU1010. Moreover, the ectopic expression of OsSalT in tobacco imparted drought stress tolerance in the transgenic lines. The transgenic lines exhibited significantly improved growth and higher osmolyte accumulation over the wild-type (WT) plants together with the induction in the OsSalT expression under drought stress. Fascinatingly, the yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analyses confirmed the interaction of OsSalT protein with two interesting transcription factors (TFs), OsNAC1 and OsDREB2A. In silico analysis further revealed that the OsSalT protein interacted with the regulatory domain of OsDREB2A and the C-terminal domain of OsNAC1 leading to their activation and induction of their downstream drought-responsive genes. Together, this study unravels a novel model for OsSalT-mediated regulation of drought tolerance in plants.

C_LIO_LIClass-III peroxidases (PRXs) are secreted into the apoplastic space and are thought to trigger either cell wall loosening, mediated by oxygen radical species, or polymerization of cell wall components, including the Tyr-mediated assembly of EXT networks (EXT-PRXs).

C_LIO_LIUsing genetic, biochemical, and modeling approaches, we identified and characterized three root hair-specific putative EXT-PRXs, PRX01, PRX44, and PRX73.

C_LIO_LIModeling and docking calculations suggested that these three putative EXT-PRXs may interact with non-O-glycosylated sections of EXT peptides that reduce the Tyr-to-Tyr intra-chain distances in EXT aggregates and thereby may enhance Tyr crosslinking.

It has been proposed using mathematical modelling that this is the result of diffusion-driven instability, originally proposed by Alan Turing. In this study we developed, analysed and validated a 3D bulk-surface model of the dynamics of Cdc42. We show that the model can undergo both classic and non-classic Turing instability by deriving necessary conditions for which this occurs and conclude that the non-classic case can be viewed as a limit case of the classic case of diffusion driven instability.

In particular, reproductive strategies with non-Mendelian inheritance, where parents do not contribute equally to the genetic makeup of their offspring. One of the most extraordinary examples of non-Mendelian inheritance is paternal genome elimination (PGE), a form of haplodiploidy which has evolved repeatedly across arthropods. Under PGE, males are diploid but only transmit maternally-inherited chromosomes to their offspring, while the paternal homologues are excluded from sperm. This asymmetric inheritance is thought to have evolved through an evolutionary arms race between paternal and maternal genomes over transmission to future generations. In several clades with PGE, such as the mealybugs (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), paternal chromosomes are not just eliminated from sperm, but also heterochromatinised early in development and thought to remain inactive. Such paternal genome silencing could alleviate genetic conflict between paternal alleles over transmission. However, it is unclear if paternal chromosomes are indeed genetically inert in both soma and germline. Here, we present a parent-of-origin allele-specific transcriptome analysis in male mealybugs. We show that expression is globally biased towards the maternal genome, but detect activity of paternal chromosomes in both somatic and reproductive tissues. Up to 70% of somatically-expressed genes are to some degree paternally-expressed. However, paternal genome expression is much more restricted in the testis, with only 20% of genes showing paternal contribution. Finally, we show that the patterns of parent-of-origin-specific gene expression are remarkably similar across genotypes and that those genes with biparental expression show elevated rates of molecular evolution. Our results provide the clearest example yet of genome-wide genomic imprinting (parent-of-origin specific gene expression) in insects. Furthermore, it enhances our understanding of PGE, which will aid future empirical tests of evolutionary theory regarding the origin of this unusual reproductive strategy.","NA"

Recently, simple polymer models have regained popularity for interpreting the experimental characterization of IDPs. Homopolymer theory provides a strong foundation for understanding generic features of phenomena ranging from single-chain conformational dynamics to the properties of entangled polymer melts, but is difficult to extend to the copolymer context. This challenge is magnified for proteins due to the variety of competing interactions and large deviations in side-chain properties. In this work, we apply a simple physics-based coarse-grained model for describing largely disordered conformational ensembles of peptides, based on the premise that sampling sterically-forbidden conformations can compromise the faithful description of both static and dynamical properties. The Hamiltonian of the employed model can be easily adjusted to investigate the impact of distinct interactions and sequence specificity on the randomness of the resulting conformational ensemble. In particular, starting with a bead-spring-like model and then adding more detailed interactions one by one, we construct a hierarchical set of models and perform a detailed comparison of their properties. Our analysis clarifies the role of generic attractions, electrostatics and side-chain sterics, while providing a foundation for developing efficient models for IDPs that retain an accurate description of the hierarchy of conformational dynamics, which is nontrivially influenced by interactions with surrounding proteins and solvent molecules.","NA"

Sorcin (gene name SRI) is a calcium (Ca2+) binding protein involved in maintaining ER Ca2+ homeostasis.

We have previously shown that overexpressing sorcin under the rat insulin promoter in transgenic mice was protective against high fat diet-induced pancreatic beta cell dysfunction, namely preserving intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during lipotoxic stress. Additionally, sorcin overexpression was apparently activating ATF6 signalling in MIN6 cells despite lowering ER stress.

Here, in order to investigate further the relationship between sorcin and ATF6, we describe changes in sorcin expression during ER and lipotoxic stress and changes in ATF6 signalling after sorcin overexpression or inactivation, both in excitable and non-excitable cells.

Sorcin mRNA levels were significantly increased in response to the ER stress-inducing agents thapsigargin and tunicamycin, but not by palmitate. On the contrary, palmitate caused a significant decrease in sorcin expression as assessed by both qRT-PCR and Western blotting despite inducing ER stress. Moreover, palmitate prevented the increase in sorcin expression induced by thapsigargin. In addition, sorcin overexpression significantly increased ATF6 transcriptional activity, whereas sorcin inactivation decreased ATF6 signalling. Finally, sorcin overexpression increased levels of ATF6 immunoreactivity and FRET imaging experiments following ER stress induction by thapsigargin showed a direct sorcin-ATF6 interaction.

Altogether, our data suggest that sorcin down-regulation during lipotoxicity may prevent full ATF6 activation and a normal UPR during the progression of obesity and insulin resistance, contributing to beta cell failure and type 2 diabetes.","NA"

In all datasets, we found that phylogenetically close OTUs significantly co-occurred more often, and OTUs with intermediate phylogenetic relatedness co-occurred less often, than expected by chance. Phylogenetically close OTUs co-excluded less often than expected by chance in the marine datasets only. Simultaneous excess of co-occurrences and co-exclusions were observed in the inversion zone between close and intermediate phylogenetic distance classes in marine surface. Similar patterns were observed by using either pairwise sequence or phylogenetic distances, and by using both null models. These results suggest that environmental filtering and dispersal limitation are the preponderant forces driving co-occurrence of protists in both environments, while signal of competitive exclusion was only detected in the marine surface environment. The discrepancy in the co-exclusion pattern is potentially linked to the individual environments: water bodies are more homogeneous while tropical forest soils contain a myriad of nutrient rich micro-environment reducing the strength of mutual exclusion.","NA"

Nitrospira distribution, diversity, and ecophysiology were studied in hypo- and subsaline (1.3-12.8 g salt/l), highly alkaline (pH 8.9-10.3) lakes by amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, and cultivation-based approaches. Surprisingly, not only were Nitrospira populations detected, but they were also considerably diverse with presence of members of Nitrospira lineages I, II and IV. Furthermore, the ability of Nitrospira enrichment cultures to oxidize nitrite at neutral to highly alkaline pH of 10.5 was demonstrated. Metagenomic analysis of a newly enriched Nitrospira lineage IV species, ""Candidatus Nitrospira alkalitolerans"", revealed numerous adaptive features of this organism to its extreme environment. Among them were a sodium-dependent N-type ATPase and NADH:quinone oxidoreductase next to the proton-driven forms usually found in Nitrospira. Other functions aid in pH and cation homeostasis and osmotic stress defense. ""Ca.

While the global source sink dynamics of the different seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, its local spread remains less clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective reproduction number changed over the course of the season. We find trends in transmission dynamics correlated positively with trends in temperature, but not relative humidity nor school holidays. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network, while school children likely drove the spread within the remaining transmission network. These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other influenza seasons and cities.

Author summaryAs shown with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, respiratory diseases can quickly spread around the globe. While it can be hugely important to understand how diseases spread around the globe, local spread is most often the main driver of novel infections of respiratory diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We here use genetic sequence data alongside patient information to better understand what the drives the local spread of influenza by looking at the 2016/2017 influenza season in Basel, Switzerland as an example. The genetic sequence data allows us to reconstruct the how the transmission dynamics changed over the course of the season, which we correlate to changes, but not humidity or school holidays. Additionally, the genetic sequence data allows us to see how individual cases are connected. Using patient information, such as age and household status our analyses suggest that the elderly mainly transmit within their own transmission network. Additionally, they suggest that school aged children, but not pre-school aged children are important drivers of the local spread of influenza.","NA"

In the absence of O2 as a respiratory electron sink, many bacteria utilize alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate (NO3-). During canonical NO3- respiration, NO3- is reduced in a stepwise manner to N2 by a dedicated set of reductases. Vibrio cholerae, the etiological agent of cholera, only requires a single periplasmic NO3- reductase (NapA) to undergo NO3- respiration, suggesting that the pathogen possesses a non-canonical NO3- respiratory chain. Here, we used complementary transposon-based screens to identify genetic determinants of general hypoxic growth and NO3- respiration in V. cholerae. We found that while the V. cholerae NO3- respiratory chain is primarily composed of homologues of established NO3- respiratory genes, it also includes components previously unlinked to this process, such as the Na+-NADH dehydrogenase Nqr. The ethanol-generating enzyme AdhE was shown to be the principal fermentative branch required during hypoxic growth in V. cholerae. Relative to single adhE or napA mutant strains, a V. cholerae strain lacking both genes exhibited severely impaired hypoxic growth in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal the genetic bases for interactions between disparate energy production pathways that support pathogen fitness in shifting conditions. Such metabolic specializations in V. cholerae and other pathogens are potential targets for antimicrobial interventions.

IMPORTANCEBacteria reprogram their metabolism in environments with low oxygen levels (hypoxia). Typically, this occurs via regulation of two major, but largely independent, metabolic pathways-fermentation and respiration. Here, we found that the diarrheal pathogen Vibrio cholerae has a respiratory chain for NO3- that consists largely of components found in other NO3- respiratory systems, but also contains several proteins not previously linked to this process. Both AdhE-dependent fermentation and NO3- respiration were required for efficient pathogen growth in both laboratory conditions and in an animal infection model. These observations provide genetic evidence for fermentative-respiratory interactions and identify metabolic vulnerabilities that may be targetable for new antimicrobial agents in V. cholerae and related pathogens.","NA"

Homologues of this gene were also identified in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. We set out to explore the mobile genetic elements involved in the acquisition and spread of this gene in publicly available and complete genomes of Pseudomonas. The crpP gene was identified only in P. aeruginosa, in more than half of the complete chromosomes (61.9%, n=133/215) belonging to 52 sequence types, of which the high-risk clone ST111 was the most frequent. We identified 136 crpP-harboring ICEs, with 93.4% belonging to the mating-pair formation G (MPFG) family. The ICEs were integrated at the end of a tRNALys gene and were all flanked by highly conserved 45-bp direct repeats. The core ICEome contains 26 genes (2.2% of all genes), which are present in 99% or more of the crpP-harboring ICEs. The most frequently encoded traits on these ICEs include replication, transcription, intracellular trafficking and cell motility. Our work reveals that ICEs are the main vectors promoting the dissemination of the ciprofloxacin-modifying crpP gene in P. aeruginosa.

Author NotesAll supporting data has been provided within the article or through supplementary data files. Supplementary material is available with the online version of this article.

Impact StatementA high proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates are resistant to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to this antibiotic is often mediated by chromosomal mutations, but recently horizontally transferred genes have been identified. We assessed the repartition of the ciprofloxacin-modifying crpP gene among Pseudomonas genomes and we characterized the mobile elements associated with its acquisition. We found that this gene is prevalent in P. aeruginosa and frequently associated with integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Importantly, we also identified highly conserved direct repeats that can be used to accurately delimit crpP-carrying ICEs in P. aeruginosa genomes.

Indeed, the tadpoles of many poison frog species will attack, kill, and cannibalize other tadpoles. We examined the neural basis of conspecific aggression in Dyeing poison frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) tadpoles by comparing individuals that won aggressive encounters, lost aggressive encounters, or did not engage in a fight. We first compared patterns of generalized neural activity using immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated ribosomes (pS6) as a proxy for neural activation associated with behavior. We found increased neural activity in the medial pallium and preoptic area of loser tadpoles, suggesting the amphibian homologs of the mammalian hippocampus and preoptic area may facilitate loser-associated behaviors. Nonapeptides (arginine vasotocin and mesotocin) and dopamine have been linked to aggression in other vertebrates and are located in the preoptic area. We next examined neural activity specifically in nonapeptide- and tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive cells using double-label immunohistochemistry. We found increased neural activity specifically in the preoptic area nonapeptide neurons of winners, whereas we found no differences in activity of dopaminergic cells among behavioral groups.

ResultsFor the first time we present a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) constructed on a Voronoi tessellation of 3D molecular structures. Despite the irregular data domain, our data representation allows to efficiently introduce both convolution and pooling operations of the network. We trained our model, called VoroCNN, to predict local qualities of 3D protein folds. The prediction results are competitive to the state of the art and superior to the previous 3D CNN architectures built for the same task.

The molecular basis underlying the pathogenesis of SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214 are still poorly understood, but both chimeras inhibit protein nuclear export mediated by the {beta}-karyopherin CRM1. In this report, we show that SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214 both disturb the localization of proteins essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport, in particular for CRM1-mediated protein export. Endogenous and exogenous SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214 form nuclear bodies. These nuclear bodies disperse upon targeted inhibition of CRM1 and the two fusion proteins re-localize throughout the nucleoplasm. Moreover, SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214 nuclear bodies reestablish shortly after removal of CRM1 inhibitors. Likewise, cell viability, metabolism, and proliferation of leukemia cell lines harboring SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214 are compromised by CRM1 inhibition, which is even sustained after clearance from CRM1 antagonists. Our results indicate CRM1 as a possible therapeutic target in NUP214-related leukemia. This is especially important, since no specific or targeted treatment options for NUP214 driven leukemia are available yet.","NA"

Through comprehensive structural, enzymology and cellular characterization of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, we here report a multi-layered substrate-recognition mechanism underpinning their divergent genomic methylation activities. A hydrogen bond in the catalytic loop of DNMT3B causes a lower CpG specificity than DNMT3A, while the interplay of target recognition domain and homodimeric interface fine-tunes the distinct target selection between the two enzymes, with Lysine 777 of DNMT3B acting as a unique sensor of the +1 flanking base. The divergent substrate preference between DNMT3A and DNMT3B provides an explanation for site-specific epigenomic alterations seen in ICF syndrome with DNMT3B mutations. Together, this study reveals crucial and distinctive substrate-readout mechanisms of the two DNMT3 enzymes, implicative of their differential roles during development and pathogenesis.","NA"

A classic example of a host frontline defence is mobbing which frequently includes contact attacking of brood parasites. Here, we investigated how the nest defence of a very aggressive great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) host influences the speed of egg-laying and egg-removing behaviour of its brood parasite - the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus). We video-recorded 168 brood parasitic events at 102 active host nests and found that cuckoos avoided host mobbing in only 62% of cases. If hosts spotted the cuckoo at their nests, they almost always attacked it (in 91 of 104 cases), however, such attacks only rarely and temporarily prevented cuckoos from parasitizing (11 additional cases). When attacked, cuckoos parasitized host nests significantly faster and left them immediately. However, when not attacked, cuckoos frequently stayed at or near the nest suggesting that host aggression, rather than the risk of being spotted, influences the speed of brood parasitism in this species. Further, we found that cuckoos performed egg-removing behaviour in all parasitic events without regard to host aggression. As a result, cuckoos removed at least one egg during all brood parasitism events except those when an egg slipped from their beaks and fell back into the nest (in 9 of 73 cases). This indicates that egg-removing behaviour is not costly for the common cuckoo and is an essential part of its parasitism strategy, widening understanding of this currently unexplained behaviour.","NA"

This taxonomic bias limits our understanding of endogenous DNA preservation for vertebrate taxa with different bone physiology, such as teleost fish. In contrast to most mammalian bone, teleost bone is typically brittle, porous, lightweight and is characterized by a lack of bone remodeling during growth. Using high-throughput shotgun sequencing, we here investigate the preservation of DNA in a range of different bone elements from over 200 archaeological Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) specimens from 38 sites in northern Europe, dating up to 8000 years before present. We observe that the majority of archaeological sites (79%) yield endogenous DNA, with 40% of sites providing samples that contain high levels (> 20%). Library preparation success and levels of endogenous DNA depend mainly on excavation site and pre-extraction laboratory treatment. The use of pre-extraction treatments lowers the rate of library success, although -- if successful -- the fraction of endogenous DNA can be improved by several orders of magnitude. This trade-off between library preparation success and levels of endogenous DNA allows for alternative extraction strategies depending on the requirements of down-stream analyses and research questions. Finally, we find that -- in contrast to mammalian bones -- different fish bone elements yield similar levels of endogenous DNA. Our results highlight the overall suitability of archaeological fish bone as a source for ancient DNA and provide novel evidence for a possible role of bone remodeling in the preservation of endogenous DNA across different classes of vertebrates.","NA"

Biophysical mechanisms remain unclear, however. Using a multicellular spheroid embedded within an engineered three-dimensional matrix, we show here the potential for coexistence of solid-like, fluid-like, and gas-like phases of the cellular collective described by a jamming phase diagram. Depending upon cell type (MCF-10A vs. MDA-MB-231) and ECM density (1 to 4 mg/ml collagen), cancer cells within the spheroid display a variety of collective behaviors, including a non-migratory jammed phase and a migratory unjammed phase. At a critical collagen density, unjammed cancer cells at the spheroid periphery transition in an almost switch-like fashion between distinct modes of invasion. In the case of MDA-MB-231, for example, we find that when ECM density is 2 mg/ml or smaller single cells and cell clusters scatter from the spheroid periphery in the form of discrete gas-like particles, but when ECM density is 3 mg/ml or greater these cells flow collectively from the spheroid periphery in continuous fluid-like invasive branches. These findings suggest coexistence within the spheroid mass of multiple material phases of the cellular collective -solid-like, fluid-like, and gas-like- in a manner that is superficially similar to common inanimate multiphasic systems at thermodynamic equilibrium, but here arising in living cellular systems, all of which are displaced far from thermodynamic equilibrium. We conclude that non-equilibrium phase separation based upon jamming dynamics may provide a new physical picture to describe cellular migratory dynamics within and invasion from a tumor mass.

Also part of the interaction surface, the planar guanidinium group of a conserved Arginine (R146 of yeast ribosomal protein Rps3) is stacked adjacent to A1196. On its other side, the interaction surface is anchored to the ribosome A site through base stacking of C1054 with the wobble anticodon base of the A-site tRNA. Using Molecular Dynamics simulations of a 495-residue subsystem of translocating ribosomes, we observe base pairing of C1054 to nucleotide G at position 1 of the next-in-line codon, consistent with previous cryo-EM observations, and hydrogen bonding of A1196 and R146 to C at position 2. Hydrogen bonding to both of these codon positions is significantly weakened when C at position 2 is changed to G, A or U.

Ptr utilization in Escherichia coli involves protein glutamylation, and glutamate stands at a crossroads between catabolism and anabolism. This communication reports that the transcription factor YneJ, here renamed PtrR, is involved in the regulation of a small regulatory RNA gene, fnrS, and an operon, yneIHGF, encoding succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, Sad (YneI), glutaminase, GlsB (YneH), and several other genes. The yneI promoter is activated during putrescine utilization under nitrogen/carbon starvation conditions, and we show that PtrR is important for the putrescine stress response. It is also a repressor of fnrS gene expression, involved in the cascade regulation of mRNA synthesis for the marA and sodB genes, involved in antibiotic responses. PtrR transcriptional regulation of fnrS leads to a regulatory cascade induced by this small RNA that affects mRNA levels of ompF and the multidrug resistance regulator, MarA. We propose that PtrR functions as a dual activator/repressor, and that its regulation is important for the responses to different stress conditions involving L-glutamine/L-glutamate and putrescine utilization.

IMPORTANCEPutrescine is an important source of nitrogen for many organisms, but it also induces stress. Although its metabolism has been studied extensively, the regulatory mechanisms that control the stress response are still poorly understood. This study reveals that the HTH-type transcriptional regulator, YneJ in Escherichia coli, here re-named PtrR, is important for the putrescine stress response, in part because it plays a role in outer membrane porin regulation as a sensor in a regulatory cascade. Direct PtrR transcriptional regulation of the fnrS, yneI (sad), gltS and ptrR genes is documented and rationalized, and nine PtrR binding sites were identified using ChIP-Exo. A ptrR mutant exhibited altered resistance to a tetracycline group of antibiotics under microaerophilic conditions, suggesting that PtrR indirectly controls expression of porin genes such as ompF.","NA"

Due to its environmental niche, we hypothesize that this accession would show a better adaptation to combined waterlogging-saline stress compared to another commonly used tetraploid L. corniculatus (cv.

Results showed that salinity and waterlogging effects were more severe for the tetraploid accession, being the differences larger under the combined stress condition. In addition, Na+, Cl- and K+ concentrations were measured in young and old leaves, and in roots. A larger accumulation of Na+ and Cl- was observed under both saline and combined stress treatments for the tetraploid L. corniculatus, for which ion toxicity effects were evident. The expression of the NHX1 and CLC genes, coding for Na+ and Cl- transporters respectively, was only increased in response to combined stress in the diploid L. corniculatus plants, suggesting that ion compartmentalization mechanisms were induced in this accession.

Despite carrying out the survival assay under exceptionally harsh conditions that probably provide the lowest survival potential following high altitude flight, a high proportion of the mosquitoes survived for six and even eleven hours assay durations at 120-250m altitudes. Minimal differences in egg laying success were noted between mosquitoes exposed to high altitude survival assay and those kept near the ground. Similarly, minimal differences were found in the females ability to take an additional blood meal after oviposition between these groups.

We show that the gene expression signature of IFN response was consistent (i) across all immune cell types, (ii) all single cells profiled from three IFNpos donors using single-cell RNA-seq, and (iii) longitudinal samples of the same patient. For a better understanding of molecular differences of IFNpos versus IFNneg patients, we combined differential gene expression analysis with differential Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), which revealed a relatively small list of genes from classical monocytes including two known immune modulators, one the target of an approved therapeutic for SLE (TNFSF13B/BAFF: belimumab) and one itself a therapeutic for Rheumatoid Arthritis (IL1RN: anakinra). For a more integrative understanding of the cross-talk among different cell types and to identify potentially novel gene or pathway connections, we also developed a novel gene co-expression analysis method for joint analysis of multiple cell types named integrated WGNCA (iWGCNA). This method revealed an interesting cross-talk between T and B cells highlighted by a significant enrichment in the expression of known markers of T follicular helper cells (Tfh), which also correlate with disease severity in the context of IFNpos patients. Interestingly, higher expression of BAFF from all myeloid cells also shows a strong correlation with enrichment in the expression of genes in T cells that may mark circulating Tfh cells or related memory cell populations. These cell types have been shown to promote B cell class-switching and antibody production, which are well-characterized in SLE patients. In summary, we generated a large-scale gene expression dataset from sorted immune cell populations and present a novel computational approach to analyze such data in an integrative fashion in the context of an autoimmune disease. Our results reveal the power of a hypothesis-free and data-driven approach to discover drug targets and reveal novel cross-talk among multiple immune cell types specific to a subset of SLE patients. This approach is immediately useful for studying autoimmune diseases and is applicable in other contexts where gene expression profiling is possible from multiple cell types within the same tissue compartment.","NA"

However, the contribution of dopamine in dynamic, ecological situations where reward rates vary, and decisions evolve over time, remains unclear. In such circumstances, current (foreground) reward accrual needs to be compared continuously with potential rewards that could be obtained by travelling elsewhere (background reward rate), in order to determine the opportunity cost of staying versus leaving. We hypothesised that dopamine specifically modulates the influence of background - but not foreground - reward information when making a dynamic comparison of these variables for optimal behaviour. On a novel foraging task based on an ecological account of animal behaviour (marginal value theorem), human participants were required to decide when to leave locations in situations where foreground rewards depleted at different rates, either in rich or poor environments with high or low background rates. In line with theoretical accounts, peoples decisions to move from current locations were independently modulated by both foreground and background reward rates. Pharmacological manipulation of dopamine D2 receptor activity using the agonist cabergoline significantly affected decisions to move on, specifically modulating the effect of background but not foreground rewards rates. In particular, when on cabergoline, people left patches in poor environments much earlier. These results demonstrate a role of dopamine in signalling the opportunity cost of rewards, not value per se. Using this ecologically derived framework we uncover a specific mechanism by which D2 dopamine receptor activity modulates decision-making when foreground and background reward rates are dynamically compared.

Significance statementMany decisions, across economic, political and social spheres, involve choices to ""leave"". Such decisions depend on a continuous comparison of a current locations value, with that of other locations you could move on to. However, how the brain makes such decisions is poorly understood. Here, we developed a computerized task, based around theories of how animals make decisions to move on when foraging for food. Healthy human participants had to decide when to leave collecting financial rewards in a location, and travel to collect rewards elsewhere. Using a pharmacological manipulation, we show that the activity of dopamine in the brain modulates decisions to move on, with people valuing other locations differently depending on their dopaminergic state.","NA"

Based on the recently solved structure of this domain, it was proposed to function as a chock. In vitro, {gamma}-disulfide formation slows down the activity of the CF1Fo at low transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient [Formula]. Here, we utilize in vivo absorption spectroscopy measurements for functional CF1Fo activity characterization in Arabidopsis leaves. The spectroscopic method allows us to measure the [Formula] present in dark-adapted leaves, and to identify its mitochondrial sources. Furthermore, we follow the fate of the extra [Formula] generated by an illumination, including its osmotic and electric components, and from there we estimate the lifetime of the light-generated ATP. In contrast with a previous report [Joliot and Joliot, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1777 (2008) 676-683], the CF1Fo {gamma}-subunit exists mostly in an oxidized form in the dark-adapted state. To study the redox regulation of the CF1Fo, we used thiol agent infiltration in WT and a mutant that does not form the {gamma}-disulfide.

Harvey Millar","The University of Western Australia","2020-04-29",1,"cc_no","new results","plant biology","Malate is the major substrate for respiratory oxidative phosphorylation in illuminated leaves. In the mitochondria malate is converted to citrate either for replenishing tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with carbon, or to be exported as substrate for cytosolic biosynthetic pathways or for storage in the vacuole. In this study, we show that DIC2 functions as a mitochondrial malate/citrate carrier in vivo in Arabidopsis. DIC2 knockout (dic2-1) results in growth retardation that can only be restored by expressing DIC2 but not its closest homologs DIC1 or DIC3, indicating that their substrate preferences are not identical. Malate uptake by non-energised dic2-1 mitochondria is reduced but can be restored in fully energised mitochondria by altering fumarate and pyruvate/oxaloacetate transport. A reduced citrate export but an increased citrate accumulation in substrate-fed, energised dic2-1 mitochondria suggest that DIC2 facilitates the export of citrate from the matrix. Consistent with this, metabolic defects in response to a sudden dark shift or prolonged darkness could be observed in dic2-1 leaves, including altered malate, citrate and 2-oxoglutarate utilisation. There was no alteration in TCA cycle metabolite pools and NAD redox state at night; however, isotopic glucose tracing reveals a reduction in citrate labelling in dic2-1 which resulted in a diversion of flux towards glutamine, as well as the removal of excess malate via asparagine and threonine synthesis. Overall, these observations indicate that DIC2 is responsible in vivo for mitochondrial malate import and citrate export which coordinate carbon metabolism between the mitochondrial matrix and the other cell compartments.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMitochondria are pivotal for plant metabolism. One of their central functions is to provide carbon intermediates for the synthesis of critical building blocks, such as amino acids. Malate import and citrate export are two of the most recognised and specialised features of the mitochondrial role in the plant cellular metabolic network, yet the possibility that a single carrier would unite both functions has not been considered. Here, we have demonstrated that DIC2 preferentially fulfils these two functions in Arabidopsis thaliana in vivo, making it a bifunctional gateway for two major metabolite fluxes into and out of the mitochondrial matrix in the plant cell. Our results highlight the significance of DIC2 in cooperation with other mitochondrial carriers in maintaining metabolic balance even under challenging environmental conditions.","NA"

Duplications in each component, which potentially could generate thousands of combinations of this signaling complex, are also evident in other angiosperms. Widespread duplication in angiosperms raises the question what evolutionary mechanisms underlie the expansion and retention of these gene families, as duplicated genes are typically rendered non-functional. As genetic and genomic resources make it a tractable model system, here we investigated this question using LLG gene family evolution and function in Brassicaceae. We first established that the LLG homologs in the Brassicaceae resulted from duplication events that pre-date the divergence of species in this family. Complementation of vegetative phenotypes in llg1 by LRE, LLG2, and LLG3 showed that the molecular functions of LLG homologs in A. thaliana are conserved. We next tested the possibility that differences in gene expression (regulatory subfunctionalization), rather than functional divergence, played a role in retention of these duplicated genes. For this, we examined the function and expression of LRE and LLG1 in A. thaliana and their single copy ortholog in Cleome violacea (Clevi LRE/LLG1), a representative species outside the Brassicaceae, but from the same order (Brassicales). We showed that expression of LLG1 and LRE did not overlap in A. thaliana and that Clevi-LRE/LLG1 expression in C. violacea encompassed all the expression domains of A. thaliana LRE + LLG1. Still, complementation experiments showed that LLG1 rescued reproductive phenotypes in lre and that Clevi LRE/LLG1 rescued both vegetative and reproductive phenotypes in llg1 and lre. Additionally, we found that expression of LLG2 and LLG3 in A. thaliana have also diverged from the expression of their corresponding single copy ortholog (Clevi LLG2/LLG3) in C. violacea. Our findings demonstrated how regulatory subfunctionalization, rather than functional divergence, underlies the retention of the LLG gene family in Brassicaceae. Our findings on the regulatory divergence and functional conservation provide an experimental framework to characterize the combinatorial assembly and function of this critical plant cell signaling complex.","NA"

Recognizing viral PTMs is very important for better understanding the mechanism of viral infections and finding potential drug targets. However, few studies have investigated the roles of viral PTMs in virus-human interactions using comprehensive viral PTM datasets. To fill this gap, firstly, we developed a viral post-translational modification database (VPTMdb) for collecting systematic information of viral PTM data. The VPTMdb contains 912 PTM sites that integrate 414 experimental-confirmed PTM sites with 98 proteins in 45 human viruses manually extracted from 162 publications and 498 PTMs extracted from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Secondly, we investigated the viral PTM sequence motifs, the function of target human proteins, and characteristics of PTM protein domains. The results showed that (i) viral PTMs have the consensus motifs with human proteins in phosphorylation, SUMOylation and N-glycosylation. (ii) The function of human proteins that targeted by viral PTM proteins are related to protein targeting, translation, and localization. (iii) Viral PTMs are more likely to be enriched in protein domains. The findings should make an important contribution to the field of virus-human interaction. Moreover, we created a novel sequence-based classifier named VPTMpre to help users predict viral protein phosphorylation sites. Finally, an online web server was implemented for users to download viral protein PTM data and predict phosphorylation sites of interest.

Author summaryPost-translational modifications (PTMs) plays an important role in the regulation of viral proteins; However, due to the limitation of data sets, there has been no detailed investigation of viral protein PTMs characteristics. In this manuscript, we collected experimentally verified viral protein post-translational modification sites and analysed viral PTMs data from a bioinformatics perspective. Besides, we constructed a novel feature-based machine learning model for predicting phosphorylation site. This is the first study to explore the roles of viral protein modification in virus infection using computational methods. The valuable viral protein PTM data resource will provide new insights into virus-host interaction.","NA"

However, most arthropod monitoring programs are short-lived and limited in taxonomic resolution and spatial extent. Consequently, variation in population dynamics among taxa and habitats remains poorly understood. Monitoring data from the Arctic are particularly underrepresented, yet important to assessments of species abundance changes because many anthropogenic drivers of change that are present in other regions are absent in polar regions. Here, we utilise 24 years of abundance data from Zackenberg in High-Arctic Greenland, which is the longest running Arctic arthropod monitoring program, to study temporal trends in abundance. Despite a strong warming signal in air temperature, we only find evidence of weak temporal trends in arthropod abundances across most taxa. These trends are more pronounced in the most recent decade, with change point analyses suggesting distinct non-linear dynamics within some functional groups such as predators and detritivores. Although the abundances of many taxa were correlated, we detected both positive and negative correlations, suggesting that multiple processes are affecting arthropod populations even in this relatively simple Arctic food web. Finally, we found clear differences among species within single families of arthropods, indicating that an apparent lack of change in abundance at broader taxonomic or functional levels could mask substantial species-specific trends. Our results reiterate the need for more basic research into the life-history, ecology, and adaptation of arthropod species to better understand their sensitivity to global changes.

Significance statementTerrestrial arthropods, including insects and spiders, serve critical ecosystem functions and are excellent indicators of environmental change due to their physiology, short generation time, and abundance. The Arctic, with its rapid climate change and limited direct anthropogenic impact, is ideal for examining arthropod population dynamics. We use the most comprehensive, standardized dataset available on Arctic arthropods to evaluate the variability in population dynamics for the most common arthropod groups at various taxonomic levels across 24 years. Our results highlight that temporal trends of arthropod populations seem less directional in the Arctic than in temperate regions. Although abundances of some arthropod taxa are declining, particularly in recent decades, population trends still display high variation among time periods, taxa, and habitats.","NA"

However, several VDR binding sites across the genome demonstrated increased DNA methylation in cells of adult origin. Genes associated with these VDR binding sites were enriched for intracellular signalling and cell activation pathways, suggesting that age-dependent potential for myeloid cell differentiation and adaptive immune system regulation may be encoded for by DNA methylation.

The resulting time series unfold in the range of slow cortical potentials the spatio-temporal integrity of a cortical pathway from the source of perception to the mouth of reaction in and out of known functional, anatomical and cytoarchitectonic networks. These pathways are consolidated in phase images described by a small vector matrix, which leads to massive simplification of cortical field theory and even to simple technical applications.","NA"

Given the close phylogenetic relationship and physical similarities between humans and apes, NLR may similarly be a useful diagnostic tool in assessing chimpanzee health. Only one study has examined NLR in apes, reporting that NLR increased with age and was affected by body-mass index and sex. In the current study, we examined changes in NLR data from longitudinal health records for 443 chimpanzees in two captive chimpanzee populations. Using these data, we analyzed intra-individual changes and inter-individual differences in NLR as a function of age, rearing history, and sex. Contrary to previous studies in humans and the one previous study in chimpanzees, NLR values did not change over a 10-year timespan within individual chimpanzees. However, cross-sectional comparisons revealed a significant quadratic relationship between age and NLR with the highest values during mid-life (20-30 years of age) and the lowest values in younger and older individuals. Additionally, males and mother-reared individuals had higher NLR than females and nursery-reared chimpanzees, respectively. Lastly, males and those with higher NLR values died at younger ages. These findings may suggest that NLR can be used a predictor of longevity in chimpanzees. However, given the complexities of these relationships, more research is needed to determine the utility of NLR as a diagnostic health tool for use in chimpanzees.","NA"

U.","Laurent  Udo Perrinet","Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS","2020-04-29",3,"cc_by","new results","neuroscience","Animal behavior constantly adapts to changes, for example when the statistical properties of the environment change unexpectedly. For an agent that interacts with this volatile setting, it is important to react accurately and as quickly as possible. It has already been shown that when a random sequence of motion ramps of a visual target is biased to one direction (e.g. right or left), human observers adapt their eye movements to accurately anticipate the targets expected direction. Here, we prove that this ability extends to a volatile environment where the probability bias could change at random switching times. In addition, we also recorded the explicit prediction of the next outcome as reported by observers using a rating scale. Both results were compared to the estimates of a probabilistic agent that is optimal in relation to the assumed generative model. Compared to the classical leaky integrator model, we found a better match between our probabilistic agent and the behavioral responses, both for the anticipatory eye movements and the explicit task. Furthermore, by controlling the level of preference between exploitation and exploration in the model, we were able to fit for each individuals experimental dataset the most likely level of volatility and analyze inter-individual variability across participants. These results prove that in such an unstable environment, human observers can still represent an internal belief about the environmental contingencies, and use this representation both for sensory-motor control and for explicit judgments. This work offers an innovative approach to more generically test the diversity of human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.

Author summaryUnderstanding how humans adapt to changing environments to make judgments or plan motor responses based on time-varying sensory information is crucial for psychology, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Current theories for how we deal with the environments uncertainty, that is, in response to the introduction of some randomness change, mostly rely on the behavior at equilibrium, long after after a change. Here, we show that in the more ecological case where the context switches at random times all along the experiment, an adaptation to this volatility can be performed online. In particular, we show in two behavioral experiments that humans can adapt to such volatility at the early sensorimotor level, through their anticipatory eye movements, but also at a higher cognitive level, through explicit ratings. Our results suggest that humans (and future artificial systems) can use much richer adaptive strategies than previously assumed.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007438"

We detected ROS in stigma exudate, found hyperpolarization in exudate-treated growing pollen tubes and used flow cytometry of pollen protoplasts to compare the effects of fresh exudate and exogenous H2O2 on pollen tube plasmalemma. Exudate causes plasmalemma hyperpolarization similar to the one provoked by H2O2, which is abolished by catalase treatment and ROS quencher MnTMPP. Inhibitory analysis indicates the participation of Ca2+- and K+-conducting channels in the observed hyperpolarization, linking obtained data with previous patch-clamp studies in vitro. For a deeper understanding of pollen response to ROS we analyzed proteome alterations in H2O2-treated pollen grains.

Thus, we hypothesized that transient hyperglycemic spikes may be a risk factor for diabetic wound healing. We showed that transient hyperglycemia caused persistent damage to the vascular endothelium. Transient hyperglycemia directly upregulated DNMT1 expression, leading to the hypermethylation of Ang-1 and reduced Ang-1 expression, which, in turn, induced long-lasting activation of nuclear factor (NF)-{kappa}B and subsequent endothelial dysfunction. An in vivo study further showed that inhibition of DNMT1 promoted angiogenesis and accelerated diabetic wound healing by regulating the Ang-1/NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway.

Despite high p-eIF2 levels, differentiated DCs display active protein synthesis and no signs of a chronic ISR. eIF2 phosphorylation does not majorly impact DC differentiation nor cytokines production.

Here we report on the identification of several antagonists of the odorant receptor co-receptor of the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, AgamORco, in a small collection of natural volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a relevant insect cell-based screening platform. Because some of the identified antagonists were previously shown to strongly repel Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes, here we examined the bioactivities of the identified antagonists against Aedes, the third major genus of the Culicidae family. The tested antagonists were found to inhibit the function of Ae. aegypti ORco ex vivo and repel Asian tiger, Ae. albopictus, adult mosquitoes. Specific antagonist binary mixtures elicited higher repellency than single antagonists. Binding competition assays suggested antagonist binding to distinct ORco sites as a likely cause for the enhanced repellence of the blends. These findings demonstrate that a simple screening assay may be used for the identification of allosteric modifiers of olfactory-driven behaviors capable of providing enhanced indoor and outdoor protection against multiple mosquito borne infectious diseases.","NA"

Intriguingly, in the case of amyloidogenic precursors, the presence of these conformations (hidden to conventional crystallographic studies) can be correlated to the pathological fate of the native fold.

It remains unclear, however, to which extent these minor conformations reflect the protein behaviour that is more commonly studied in solution. Here, we address this question by investigating some biophysical properties of a prototypical amyloidogenic system, {beta}2-microglobulin ({beta}2m) in solution and in microcrystalline state.

By combining NMR chemical shifts with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we confirmed that conformational dynamics of {beta}2m native state in the crystal lattice is in keeping with what observed in solution.

A comparative study of protein stability in solution and in crystallo is then carried out, monitoring the change in protein secondary structure at increasing temperature by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The increased structural order of the crystalline state contributes to provide better resolved spectral components compared to those collected in solution and crucially, the crystalline samples display thermal stabilities in good agreement with the trend observed in solution.

Overall, this work shows that protein stability and occurrence of pathological hidden states in crystals parallel their solution counterpart, confirming the interest of crystals as a platform for the biophysical characterisation of processes such as unfolding and aggregation.","NA"

The actin structure plays a key role in regulating cellular behaviors like motility, cell sorting, or cell polarity. From the earliest stages of development, in naive stem cells, the critical mechanical role of the actin structure is becoming recognized as a vital cue for correct segregation and lineage control of cells and as a regulatory structure that controls several transcription factors. The ultrastructure of the earliest embryonic stem cells has not been investigated in living cells despite the fact that it is well-known that cells undergo morphological shape changes during the earliest stages of development. Here, we provide 3D investigations of the actin cytoskeleton of naive mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in clusters of sizes relevant for early stage development using super resolution optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). We quantitatively describe the morphological, cytoskeletal and mechanical changes appearing between cells in small clusters at the earliest stages of inner cell mass differentiation, as recapitulated by cells cultured under two media conditions, 2i and Serum/LIF, thus promoting the naive and first primed state, respectively. High resolution images of living stem cells showed that the peripheral actin structure undergoes a dramatic change between the two media conditions. The actin organization changed from being predominantly oriented parallel to the cell surface in 2i medium to a more radial orientation in Serum/LIF. Finally, using an optical trapping based technique, we detected micro-rheological differences in the cell periphery between the cells cultured in these two media, with results correlating well with the observed nano-architecture of the ESCs in the two different differentiation stages. These results pave the way for linking physical properties and cytoskeletal architecture to the development from naive stem cells to specialized cells.

Statement of SignificanceCells receive mechanical signals and must provide mechanical feedback, therefore, physical properties are instrumental for cell-cell interactions. Mechanical signals mediated through the cell surface can significantly affect transport of signaling molecules and can influence biological processes like transcriptional regulation. To achieve a deeper insight into how the cytoskeletal structure is responsible for cell shape and material properties at the earliest stages of development, we employ super-resolution microscopy to image actin fibers in clusters of embryonic stem cells mimicking early development. By modification of the culturing conditions, we investigate how the actin cytoskeleton and micro-rheological properties of ESCs change between the naive ground state and the stage primed towards epiblast, thus revealing a correlation between differentiation stage and cytoskeletal structure.","NA"

Efforts to control and prevent zoonotic disease have traditionally focused on animal-to-human transmission, or ""spillover"". However, in the modern era, increasing international mobility and commerce facilitate the spread of infected humans, non-human animals (hereafter animals), and their products worldwide, thereby increasing the risk that zoonoses will be introduced to new geographic areas. Imported zoonoses can potentially  spill back to infect local wildlife--a danger magnified by urbanization and other anthropogenic pressures that increase contacts between human and wildlife populations. In this way, humans can function as vectors, dispersing zoonoses from their ancestral enzootic systems to establish reservoirs elsewhere in novel animal host populations. Once established, these enzootic cycles are largely unassailable by standard control measures and have the potential to feed human epidemics. Understanding when and why translocated zoonoses establish novel enzootic cycles requires disentangling ecologically complex and stochastic interactions between the zoonosis, the human population, and the natural ecosystem. We address this challenge by delineating potential ecological mechanisms affecting each stage of enzootic establishment--wildlife exposure, enzootic infection, and persistence--applying existing ecological concepts from epidemiology, invasion biology, and population ecology. We ground our study in the neotropics, where four arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of zoonotic origin--yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses--have separately been introduced into the human population. This paper is a step towards developing a framework for predicting and preventing novel enzootic cycles in the face of zoonotic translocations.","NA"

We identified 20,740 and 9,556 for protein-coding and non-coding genes, and recovered 23,402 orthologous groups. Through a comparative genomics approach across a diversity of mammals, we identified genes under positive selection associated with longevity and brain development, which are of particular relevance to capuchin and primate comparative biology. Additionally, we compared populations in distinct habitats, facilitated by our novel method for minimally-biased, whole-genome sequencing from fecal DNA using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). By analyzing 23 capuchin genomes from tropical dry forest and rainforest, we identified population divergence in genes involved in water balance, kidney function, and metabolism, consistent with local adaptation to resource seasonality.

ConclusionsOur comparative study of capuchin genomics provides new insights into the molecular basis of brain evolution and longevity. These data also improve our understanding of processes of local adaptation to diverse and physiologically challenging environments. Additionally, we provide a technological advancement in use of non-invasive genomics to study free-ranging mammals through FACS.","NA"

In eukaryotes, such unstable cellular proteins are selectively degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Furthermore, abnormalities in protein degradation by the UPS have been linked to several human diseases. Ccr4 protein is a known component of the Ccr4-Not complex, which has established roles in transcription, mRNA de-adenylation and RNA degradation etc. Excitingly in this study, we show that Ccr4 protein has a novel function as a shuttle factor that promotes ubiquitin-dependent degradation of short-lived proteins by the 26S proteasome. Using a substrate of the well-studied ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD) pathway, we found that its UPS-mediated degradation was severely impaired upon deletion of CCR4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Additionally, we show that Ccr4 binds to cellular ubiquitin conjugates and the proteasome. In contrast to Ccr4, most other subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex proteins are dispensable for UFD substrate degradation. From our findings we conclude that Ccr4 functions in the UPS as a shuttle factor targeting ubiquitylated substrates for proteasomal degradation.","NA"

Due to technological advances in sequencing, such as the widely used non-invasive prenatal test, massive datasets of ultra-low coverage sequencing are being generated. These datasets are characterized by having a large amount of missing genotype information. We present EMU, a method for inferring population structure in the presence of rampant non-random missingness.

ResultsWe show through simulations that several commonly used PCA methods can not handle missing data arisen from various sources, which leads to biased results as individuals are projected into the PC space based on their amount of missingness. In terms of accuracy, EMU outperforms an existing method that also accommodates missingness while being competitively fast. We further tested EMU on around 100K individuals of the Phase 1 dataset of the Chinese Millionome Project, that were shallowly sequenced to around 0.08x. From this data we are able to capture the population structure of the Han Chinese and to reproduce previous analysis in a matter of CPU hours instead of CPU years.

ConclusionsEMUs capability to accurately infer population structure in the presence of missingness will be of increasing importance with the rising number of large-scale genetic datasets. EMU is written in Python and is freely available at https://github.com/Rosemeis/emu/.","NA"

One factor contributing to this challenge is the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in ASD, which suggests that several different system disruptions may contribute to diverse patterns of impairment between and within study samples. Here, we took a retrospective approach, using SFARI data to study ASD by focusing on participants with genetic imbalances targeting the dopaminergic system. Using complex network analysis, we investigated the relations between participants, Gene Ontology (GO) and gene dosage related to dopaminergic neurotransmission from a polygenic point of view. We converted network analysis into a machine learning binary classification problem to differentiate ASD diagnosed participants from DD (developmental delay) diagnosed participants. Using 1846 participants to train a Random Forest algorithm, our best classifier achieved on average a diagnosis predicting accuracy of 85.18% (sd 1.11%) on a test sample of 790 participants using gene dosage features. In addition, we observed that if the classifier uses GO features it was also able to infer a correct response based on the previous examples because it is tied to a set of biological process, molecular functions and cellular components relevant to the problem. This yields a less variable and more compact set of features when comparing with gene dosage classifiers. Other facets of knowledge-based systems approaches addressing ASD through network analysis and machine learning, providing an interesting avenue of research for the future, are presented through the study.

Lay SummaryThere are important issues in the differential diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders. Gene dosage effects may be important in this context. In this work, we studied genetic alterations related to dopamine processes that could impact brain development and function of 2636 participants. On average, from a genetic sample we were able to correctly separate autism from developmental delay with an accuracy of 85%.","NA"

However, expression profiles, especially when collected in large numbers, inherently contain variations introduced by technical artifacts (e.g., batch effects) and uninteresting biological variables (e.g., age) in addition to the true signals of interest. These sources of variations, called confounders, produce embeddings that fail to transfer to different domains, i.e., an embedding learned from one dataset with a specific confounder distribution does not generalize to different distributions. To remedy this problem, we attempt to disentangle confounders from true signals to generate biologically informative embeddings.

ResultsIn this paper, we introduce the AD-AE (Adversarial Deconfounding AutoEncoder) approach to deconfounding gene expression latent spaces. The AD-AE model consists of two neural networks: (i) an autoencoder to generate an embedding that can reconstruct original measurements, and (ii) an adversary trained to predict the confounder from that embedding. We jointly train the networks to generate embeddings that can encode as much information as possible without encoding any confounding signal. By applying AD-AE to two distinct gene expression datasets, we show that our model can (1) generate embeddings that do not encode confounder information, (2) conserve the biological signals present in the original space, and (3) generalize successfully across different confounder domains. We demonstrate that AD-AE outperforms standard autoencoder and other deconfounding approaches.

Unlike most other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) occupy coastal habitats near their overwintering rivers during their marine phase, thus making adaptation to marine habitats possible. The aim of this study was to document the neutral and adaptive variation of populations among anadromous Arctic Char in Nunavik and bordering regions. We used GBS to genotype 20,327 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 650 individuals sampled in 23 locations along >2,000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbour distinct populations grouping within major oceanographic basins, namely the Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be influenced by both post-glacial recolonization history and by patterns of isolation-by-distance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Furthermore, using three gene-environment association (GEA) methods we found genomic evidence for local adaptation to both freshwater and marine habitats, especially in relation to sea-surface and air temperatures during summer, precipitation, and salinity.

Here, we use a functional data analysis approach--which models spectra as smooth curves rather than as a discrete set of points--to develop a method that is robust to geographic heterogeneity. Specifically, we use a penalised generalised linear modelling framework which includes efficient functional representation of spectra, spectral smoothing and regularisation. To ensure better generalisation of model predictions from one training set to another, we use cross-validation procedures favouring smoother representation of spectra. To illustrate the performance of our approach, we collected spectra for field-caught specimens of Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes - the most epidemiologically important vector species on the planet - in two sites in Burkina Faso.

Here we identify and characterize a novel effect of Anthracyclines, a class of drugs currently used as potent anticancer drugs, in the regulation of NF-{kappa}B transcriptional activity in BMDMs, in addition to the previously reported DNA damage and histone eviction. Anthracyclines, including Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin and Epirubicin, disturb the complexes formed between the NF-{kappa}B subunit RelA and its DNA binding sites, to limit NF-{kappa}B-dependent gene transcription during inflammatory responses, including of pivotal pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF. We observed that suppression of inflammation can also be mediated by Aclarubicin, Doxorubicinone and the newly developed Dimethyl-doxorubicin, which share anticancer properties with the other Anthracyclines, but do not induce DNA damage in the tested concentrations. This novel mechanism of action of Anthracyclines, contributing to the reduction of inflammation, is thus independent of the activation of DNA damage responses and may be relevant for the development of novel strategies targeting immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.","NA"

The resulting escape trajectory (ET) - measured as the angle of escape direction relative to the predators approach path - plays a major role in avoiding predation. Previous geometrical models predict a single ET; however, many animals (fish and other animal taxa) show highly variable ETs with multiple preferred directions. Although such a high ET variability may confer unpredictability, preventing predators from adopting counter-strategies, the reasons why animals prefer specific multiple ETs remain unclear. Here, we constructed a novel geometrical model in which Tdiff (the time difference between the prey entering the safety zone and the predator reaching that entry point) is expected to be maximized. We tested this prediction by analyzing the escape responses of Pagrus major attacked by a dummy predator. At each initial body orientation of the prey relative to the predator, our model predicts a multimodal ET with an optimal ET at the maximum Tdiff (Tdiff,1) and a suboptimal ET at a second local maximum of Tdiff (Tdiff,2). Our experiments show that when Tdiff, 1-Tdiff, 2 is negligible, the prey uses optimal or suboptimal ETs to a similar extent, in line with the idea of unpredictability. The experimentally observed ET distribution is consistent with the model, showing two large peaks at 110-130{degrees} and 170-180{degrees} away from the predator. Because various animal taxa show multiple preferred ETs similar to those observed here, this behavioral phenotype may result from convergent evolution that combines maximal Tdiff with a high level of unpredictability.

Significance StatementAnimals from many taxa escape from suddenly approaching threats, such as ambush predators, by using multiple preferred escape trajectories. However, the reason why these multiple preferred escape trajectories are used is still unknown. By fitting a newly constructed model to the empirical escape response data, we show that the seemingly complex multiple preferred escape trajectories can arise from a simple geometrical rule which maximizes the time difference between when the prey enters the safety zone and when the predator reaches that entry point. Our results open new avenues of investigation for understanding how animals choose their escape trajectories from behavioral and neurosensory perspectives.","NA"

Across males the expression of sexual and competitive traits, including ornamentation and aggressive behavior, is often mediated by testosterone. In the White-shouldered Fairywren (Malurus alboscapulatus) of New Guinea, females of different subspecies differ in presence or absence of white shoulder patches and melanic plumage, while males are uniformly ornamented. Previous work has shown that ornamented females circulate more testosterone and exhibit more territorial aggression than do unornamented females. We investigated the degree to which testosterone regulates expression of ornamental plumage and territorial behavior by implanting free-living unornamented females with testosterone. Every testosterone-treated female produced a male-like cloacal protuberance, and 15 of 20 replaced plucked brown feathers with white shoulder patch feathers, but did not produce melanic plumage characteristic of ornamented females. Testosterone treatment did not elevate territorial behavior prior to production of the plumage ornament and exhaustion of the implant. However, females with experimentally induced ornamentation, but exhausted implants, increased the vocal components of territory defense relative to fully unornamented control and also to testosterone-implanted females. Our results suggest that testosterone induces partial acquisition of the ornamental plumage phenotype, and that ornament expression, rather than testosterone alone, results in elevated territorial behavior.

Lay SummaryTestosterone regulates expression of a suite of competitive traits in male organisms and could have similar function in females. Empirical tests are needed to determine the extent to which testosterone promotes production of ornamentation and competitive behaviors in female animals. We supplemented testosterone in unornamented females of a species where naturally occurring ornamented females circulate higher testosterone and are more territorially aggressive. Implanted females produced partial ornamentation, which was followed by increased territoriality that was apparently unrelated to testosterone circulation itself.","NA"

Lp16-PSP was analyzed using bioinformatics tools, cloned in a prokaryotic expression vector pET32a (+) and transformed into E. coli Rosetta gami. It was expressed and solubilized under optimized conditions. The differential scanning fluorometry (DSF)-guided refolding method was used with modifications to identify the proper refolding conditions for the Lp16-PSP protein. In order to determine the selective anticancer potential of Lp16-PSP, a panel of human cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines was used. Lp16-PSP protein was identified as endoribonuclease L-PSP protein and a member of the highly conserved YjgF/YER057c/UK114 protein superfamily. Lp16-PSP was expressed under optimized conditions (37{degrees}C for 4 h following induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl {beta}-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside). Solubilization was achieved with mild solubilization buffer containing 2M urea using the freeze-thaw method. The DSF guided refolding method identified the proper refolding conditions (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 400 mM Arginine, 0.2 mM GSH and 2 mM GSSG; pH 8.0) for Lp16-PSP, with a melting transition of ~58{degrees}C. A final yield of ~16 mg of purified Lp16-PSP from 1 L of culture was obtained following dialysis and concentration by PEG 20,000. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay revealed the selective cytotoxic effect of Lp16-PSP. The HL-60 cell line was demonstrated to be most sensitive to Lp16-PSP, with an IC50 value of 74.4{+/-}1.07 g/ml. The results of the present study suggest that Lp16-PSP may serve as a potential anticancer agent; however, further investigation is required to characterize this anticancer effect and to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the action of Lp16-PSP.","NA"

Maternal separation was used as an animal paradigm for early-life stress. We found that stressed Appwt/wt mice showed narrowing of vessels and decreased pericyte coverage of capillaries in prefrontal cortex, while stressed AppNL-G-F/wt mice showed impairment of place memory, and earlier formation of A{beta} plaques and disruption of the blood-brain barrier than non-stressed AppNL-G-F/wt mice. We detected severe activation of microglia in the stressed AppNL-G-F/wt mice and stressed Appwt/wt mice. In the earlier stage, we detected morphological change and functional change in microglia in the stressed AppNL-G-F/wt mice and stressed Appwt/wt mice, and also detected morphological change in the microglia in the non-stressed AppNL-G-F/wt mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that activated microglia induced by the combination of maternal separation and APP mutation impairs the vascular system, leading to AD progression. These findings therefore suggest that maternal separation causes early induction of AD pathology.","NA"

Many studies have supported this conceptualization, but they have used alternative statistical models with differing interpretations. In bifactor models, every symptom loads on both the general factor and one specific factor (e.g., internalizing), which partitions the total explained variance in each symptom between these orthogonal factors. In second-order models, symptoms load on one of several correlated lower-order factors. These lower-order factors load on a second-order general factor, which is defined by the variance shared by the lower-order factors. Thus, the factors in second-order models are not orthogonal. Choosing between these valid statistical models depends on the hypothesis being tested. Because bifactor models define orthogonal phenotypes with distinct sources of variance, they are optimal for studies of shared and unique associations of the dimensions of psychopathology with external variables putatively relevant to etiology and mechanisms. Concerns have been raised, however, about the reliability of the orthogonal specific factors in bifactor models. We evaluated this concern using parent symptom ratings of 9-10 year olds in the ABCD Study. Psychometric indices indicated that all factors in both bifactor and second-order models exhibited at least adequate construct reliability and estimated replicability. The factors defined in bifactor and second-order models were highly to moderately correlated across models, but have different interpretations. All factors in both models demonstrated significant associations with external criterion variables of theoretical and clinical importance, but the interpretation of such associations in second-order models was ambiguous due to shared variance among factors.

General Scientific SummarySome investigators have proposed that viewing the correlated symptoms of psychopathology as a hierarchy in which all symptoms are related to both a general (p) factor of psychopathology and a more specific factor will make it easier to distinguish potential risk factors and mechanisms that are nonspecifically related to all forms of psychopathology versus those that are associated with specific dimensions of psychopathology. Parent ratings of child psychopathology items from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study were analyzed using two alternative statistical models of the proposed hierarchy. All factors of psychopathology defined in both bifactor and second-order models demonstrated adequate psychometric properties and criterion validity, but associations of psychopathology factors with external variables were more easily interpreted in bifactor than in second-order models.","NA"

Turbulence affects phytoplankton migration, both by transporting cells and by triggering switches in migratory behavior, whereby vertically migrating cells can invert their direction of migration upon exposure to turbulent cues. However, a mechanistic link between single-cell physiology and vertical migration of phytoplankton in turbulence is currently missing. Here, by combining physiological and behavioral experiments with a mathematical model of stress accumulation and dissipation, we show that the mechanism responsible for the switch in the direction of migration in the marine raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo is the integration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling generated by turbulent cues. Within timescales as short as tens of seconds, the emergent downward-migrating subpopulation exhibited a two-fold increase of ROS, an indicator of stress, 15% lower photosynthetic efficiency, and 35% lower growth rate over multiple generations compared to the upward-migrating subpopulation. The origin of the behavioral split in a bistable oxidative stress response is corroborated by the observation that exposure of cells to exogenous stressors (H2O2, UV-A radiation or high irradiance), in lieu of turbulence, caused comparable ROS accumulation and an equivalent split into the two subpopulations. By providing a mechanistic link between single-cell physiology, population-scale migration and fitness, these results contribute to our understanding of phytoplankton community composition in future ocean conditions.

Significance StatementTurbulence has long been known to drive phytoplankton fitness and species succession: motile species dominate in calmer environments and non-motile species in turbulent conditions. Yet, a mechanistic understanding of the effect of turbulence on phytoplankton migratory behavior and physiology is lacking. By combining a method to generate turbulent cues, quantification of stress accumulation and physiology, and a mathematical model of stress dynamics, we show that motile phytoplankton use their mechanical stability to sense the intensity of turbulent cues and integrate these cues in time via stress signaling to trigger switches in migratory behavior. The stress-mediated warning strategy we discovered provides a paradigm for how phytoplankton cope with turbulence, thereby potentially governing which species will be successful in a changing ocean.","NA"

Contents of octopamine (OA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT) in the brain are significantly elevated in the ants that respond with defensive turn to unexpected touch than the ants that responded with dart escape. Oral administration of DA and 5HT demonstrated that both amines contribute initiation of defensive response to tactile stimulus. Oral administration of L-DOPA weakly affected to initiate defensive turn in the ant. On the other hand, 5HTP strongly affected to initiate defensive behavior.

Most analyses classify genes as core genes, which are present in (almost) all investigated individual genomes, and dispensable genes, which only occur in a single or a few investigated genomes. The binary classification as  core or  dispensable is often based on arbitrary cutoffs of presence/absence in the analysed genomes. Even when extended to  conditionally dispensable, this concept still requires the assignment of genes to distinct groups.

Here, we present a new method which overcomes this distinct classification by quantifying gene dispensability and present a dedicated tool for reference-based QUantification Of gene Dispensability (QUOD). As a proof of concept, sequence data of 966 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions were processed to calculate a gene-specific dispensability score based on normalised coverage in read mappings. We validated this score by comparison of highly conserved Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs) to all other genes. The average scores of BUSCOs were significantly higher than the scores of non-BUSCOs. Scores of genes involved in specialised metabolism were generally lower than scores of primary metabolite genes, indicating higher dispensability of genes involved in secondary metabolic processes. Analysis of variation demonstrated lower variation values between replicates of a single accession than between iteratively, randomly selected accessions from the whole dataset.

Instead of classifying a gene as core or dispensable, QUOD assigns a dispensability score to each gene. Hence, QUOD facilitates the identification of candidate dispensable genes which often underlie lineage-specific adaptation to varying environmental conditions.","NA"

MR-GAN was then applied to extract embeddings of the sequences in a training dataset we created for eight epitranscriptome modifications, including m6A, m1A, m1G, m2G, m5C, m5U, 2'-O-Me, Pseudouridine ({Psi}) and Dihydrouridine (D), of which the positive samples are very limited.

Natural sources such as plant extracts have long played an important role in tuberculosis management and can be used as a template to design new drugs. A wide screening of natural sources is time consuming but the process can be significantly sped up using molecular docking. In this study, we used a molecular docking approach to investigate the interactions between selected natural constituents and three proteins MtPanK, MtDprE1 and MtKasA involved in the physiological functions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis which are necessary for the bacteria to survive and cause disease. The molecular docking score, a score that accounts for the binding affinity between a ligand and a target protein, for each protein was calculated against 150 chemical constituents of different classes to estimate the binding free energy. The docking scores represent the binding free energy. The best docking scores indicates the highest ligand protein binding which is indicated by the lowest energy value. Among the natural constituents, Shermilamine B showed a docking score of - 8.5kcal/mol, Brachystamide B showed a docking score of -8.6 kcal/mol with MtPanK, Monoamphilectine A showed a score of -9.8kcal/mol with MtDprE1.These three compounds showed docking scores which were superior to the control inhibitors and represent the opportunity of in vitro biological evaluation and anti-TB drug design. Consequently, all these compounds belonged to the alkaloid class. Specific interactions were studied to further understand the nature of intermolecular bonds between the most active ligands and the protein binding site residues which proved that among the constituents monoamphilectine A and Shermilamine B show more promise as Anti-TB drugs. Furthermore, the ADMET properties of these compounds or ligands showed that they have no corrosive or carcinogenic parameters.

In these studies, models are typically trained using input features derived from comprehensive sets of known AMR genes or whole genome sequences. However, it can be difficult to determine whether genomes and their corresponding sets of AMR genes are complete when sequencing contaminated or metagenomic samples. In this study, we explore the possibility of using incomplete genome sequence data to predict AMR phenotypes. Machine learning models were built from randomly-selected sets of core genes that are held in common among the members of a species, and the AMR-conferring genes were removed based on their protein annotations. For Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, and Staphylococcus aureus, we report that it is possible to classify susceptible and resistant phenotypes with average F1 scores ranging from 0.80-0.89 with as few as 100 conserved non-AMR genes, with very major error rates ranging from 0.11-0.23 and major error rates ranging from 0.10-0.20. Models built from core genes have predictive power in the cases where the primary AMR mechanism results from SNPs or horizontal gene transfer. By randomly sampling non-overlapping sets of core genes for use in these models, we show that F1 scores and error rates are stable and have little variance between replicates. Potential biases from strain-specific SNPs, phylogenetic sampling, and imbalances in the phylogenetic distribution of susceptible and resistant strains do not appear to have an impact on this result. Although these small core gene models have lower accuracies and higher error rates than models built from the corresponding assembled genomes, the results suggest that sufficient variation exists in the core non-AMR genes of a species for predicting AMR phenotypes. Overall this study suggests that building models from conserved genes may be a potentially useful strategy for predicting AMR phenotypes when genomes are incomplete.","NA"

It also uses an embedded metrics of sentence similarity offering the curator an alternative mechanism of navigating through semantically similar sentences within a given paper as well as across papers of a pre-defined corpus of publications pertinent to the task. We show results of the use of the system to curate literature in E. coli as well as literature in Salmonella.

We present Single-Cell alignment using Optimal Transport (SCOT), an unsupervised learning algorithm that uses Gromov Wasserstein-based optimal transport to align single-cell multi-omics datasets. SCOT calculates a probabilistic coupling matrix that matches cells across two datasets. The optimization uses k-nearest neighbor graphs, thus preserving the local geometry of the data.

In this paper, we identify heterogeneity in a specific glycan linkage: 2,6-linked sialic acids within breast cancer cells in vivo and in culture. Upon sorting out two populations with moderate and relatively higher cell surface 2,6-linked sialic acid levels from the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, both populations (denoted as medium and high- 2,6-Sial cells respectively) stably retained their levels in early passages. Upon continuous culturing, medium 2,6-Sial cells recapitulated the heterogeneity of the unsorted line whereas high 2,6-Sial cells showed no such tendency. Compared with the high 2,6-Sial, the medium 2,6-Sial cells showed greater adhesion to reconstituted extracellular matrices (ECM) as well as invaded faster as single cells. The level of 2,6-linked sialic acids in the two sublines was found to be consistent with the expression of a specific glycosyl transferase, ST6GAL1. Stably knocking down ST6GAL1 in the high 2,6-Sial cells, enhanced their invasiveness. When cultured together, medium 2,6-Sial cells differentially migrated to the edge of growing tumoroid-like cultures, whereas high 2,6-Sial cells formed the central bulk. Simulations in a Cellular Potts model-based computational environment that is calibrated to our experimental findings suggest that the heterogeneity of cell-ECM adhesion, likely regulated by 2,6-linked sialic acids facilitates niches of highly invasive cells to efficiently migrate centrifugally as the invasive front of a malignant tumor.","NA"

The results demonstrate that, even after masking functional genomic regions, background selection effects may result in the mis-inference of population growth under models of both constant population size as well as decline. This effect is amplified as the strength of purifying selection and the density of directly selected sites increases. We propose a potential solution to correct for this mis-inference. By treating the DFE as a nuisance parameter and averaging across all potential realizations, we demonstrate that even directly selected sites may be used to infer demographic histories with reasonable accuracy.","NA"

Since then it has rapidly infected people around the world, with more than 3 million confirmed cases by the end of April 2020. Early genome sequencing of the virus has enabled the development of molecular diagnostics and the commencement of therapy and vaccine development. The analysis of the early sequences showed relatively few evolutionary selection pressures. However, with the rapid worldwide expansion into diverse human populations, significant genetic variations are becoming increasingly likely. The current limitations on social movement between countries also offers the opportunity for these viral variants to become distinct strains with potential implications for diagnostics, therapies and vaccines.

MethodsWe used the current sequencing archives (NCBI and GISAID) to investigate 5,349 whole genomes, looking for evidence of strain diversification and selective pressure.

ResultsWe used 3,958 SNPs to build a phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 diversity and noted strong evidence for the existence of two major clades and six sub-clades, unevenly distributed across the world. We also noted that convergent evolution has potentially occurred across several locations in the genome, showing selection pressures, including on the spike glycoprotein where we noted a potentially critical mutation that could affect its binding to the ACE2 receptor. We also report on mutations that could prevent current molecular diagnostics from detecting some of the sub-clades.

ConclusionsThe worldwide whole genome sequencing effort is revealing the challenge of developing SARS-CoV-2 containment tools suitable for everyone and the need for data to be continually evaluated to ensure accuracy in outbreak estimations.","NA"

The definition of SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames is a key step in delineating targets for vaccination and treatment for COVID-19. Here, we report an integrative analysis of three independent direct RNA sequencing datasets of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. We find strong evidence for variant open reading frames (ORFs) encoded by SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A variant transcript for the matrix protein (M) lacking its N-terminal transmembrane domain, initiated by a TTG start codon, is produced by a strong transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS)-mediated junction within the M ORF and represents up to 19% of all M ORFs. Sporadic non-canonical junctions in the spike (S) ORF lead to N-terminal truncations that remove the N-terminal and receptor-binding domains from up to 25% of S ORFs. Surprisingly, nearly all ORFs from ORF1a identified in these transcriptome sequences were variant. These ORFs contain the first 200-800 amino acids of ORF1a and may represent a mechanism to regulate the relative abundance of ORF1a nonstructural proteins. We show there is strong transcriptome and junctional support for variant ORF1a ORFs in independent direct RNA sequencing and short-read RNA sequencing datasets, and further show that up to 1/3 of these ORFs are expected to have C-terminal fusions with downstream genes. Finally, we show that currently unannotated ORFs are abundant in the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. Together, these analyses help to elucidate the diverse coding potential of SARS-CoV-2.","NA"

However, NMR-BAT thermogenic potential is controversial, and its physiological roles are unknown. Here, we show that NMR-BAT has beta-3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3)-dependent thermogenic potential, which contributes to thermogenesis in the isolated queen in non-cold environments. NMR-BAT expressed several brown adipocyte marker genes and showed noradrenaline-dependent thermogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. Although our ADRB3 inhibition experiments revealed that NMR-BAT thermogenesis slightly delays the decrease in body temperature in a cold environment, it was insufficient to maintain the body temperatures of the NMRs. In a non-cold environment, NMRs are known to increase their body temperature by a heat-sharing behavior. Interestingly, we found that the body temperatures of NMRs isolated from the colony were also significantly higher than the ambient temperature. We also show that queens, but not subordinates, induce BAT thermogenesis in isolated, non-cold conditions.

This gene is most well known for its role in regulating blood pressure. But in recent times, its drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community because it may also serve as a doorway of sorts, enabling viruses like SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells. Our researchers looked at the ACE2 gene in more than 200,000 people, comparing their exact DNA sequences to see where there are differences among people. Variation in the DNA sequence of a gene is common and is sometimes meaningless. But other times, small changes in the DNA sequence can alter the protein that is made from that gene. In this case the ACE2 gene makes the ACE2 protein, which is what the SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with. We found a lot of variation between individuals and checked to see if that variation coincided with any traits (i.e., people with variant X tend to have high blood pressure more often than people without variant X). All of the traits we looked at were non-COVID-19-related traits, meaning we havent asked these people anything about COVID-19 yet (this is because these DNA sequences were collected before the pandemic).

We found that there are a number of variations observed among people in a specific part of the ACE2 gene. These variations are expected to alter the shape or functionality of a specific part of the ACE2 protein: The part that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We dont yet know what the real-life significance of this variation is, but its possible that these variants decrease the proteins ability to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thus decreasing the persons likelihood of being infected. We can speculate that there will be a spectrum of vulnerability to COVID-19 among people, where some people are more vulnerable than others, and that variants in this part of the ACE2 gene may be one of the reasons. The research we presented here shines a light on this part of the ACE2 gene and may give future researchers a direction to go in as they try to figure out what makes people vulnerable to COVID-19 and similar viruses.","NA"

For instance, the p.C565Y variant, which has been reported to be pathogenic in humans, did not exhibit functional pathogenic consequences in cell lines. To address the pathogenicity of p.C565Y, we used a genotype-based approach in which we generated knock-in mice heterozygous (Slc26a4+/C565Y), homozygous (Slc26a4C565Y/C565Y), and compound heterozygous (Slc26a4919-2A>G/C565Y) for this variant.

Though gap junctions between inhibitory cells are ubiquitous in the adult cortex, and their presence has been shown to promote synchronous network firing, their function among excitatory, pyramidal cells remains poorly understood. During development, pyramidal cells that were derived from the same progenitor cell, called sister cells, are preferentially connected by a gap junction during the first postnatal week, while chemical synapses are still being formed. Additionally, these sister cells tend to share an orientation preference and a chemical synapse in the adult cortex, a property that is diminished when gap junctions are blocked. In this work, we construct an idealized model of the mouse visual cortex during the first two postnatal weeks of development to analyze the response properties of gap-junction-coupled cells and their effect on synaptic plasticity. Further, as an application of this model, we investigate the interplay of gap-junction coupling and synaptic plasticity on the order, or organization, of the resulting cortical map of orientation preference.

Author summaryGap junctions, or sites of direct electrical connections between neurons, have a significant presence in the cortex, both during development and in adulthood. Their primary function during either of these periods, however, is still poorly understood. In the adult cortex, gap junctions between local, inhibitory neurons have been shown to promote synchronous firing, a network characteristic thought to be important for learning, attention, and memory. During development, gap junctions between excitatory, pyramidal cells, have been conjectured to play a role in synaptic plasticity and the formation of cortical circuits. In the visual cortex, where neurons exhibit tuned responses to properties of visual input such as orientation and direction, recent experiments show that excitatory cells are coupled by gap junctions during the first postnatal week and are replaced by chemical synapses during the second week. In this work, we explore the possible contribution of gap-junction coupling during development to the formation of chemical synapses both into the visual cortex from the thalamus and within the visual cortex between cortical cells. Specifically, within a mathematical model of the visual cortex during development, we identify the response properties of gap-junction-coupled cells and their influence on the formation of the cortical map of orientation preference.","NA"

Treatment strategies presently target the MAPK/ERK pathway, which is overactive in melanomas due in part to BRAF and NRAS mutations, and involve inhibitors against mutated BRAF (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) or MEK kinases (cobimetinib or trametinib), or a combination of the two. Using an established biochip technology, we assessed base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) activities in a collection of BRAF mutated (A-375, Colo 829, HT-144, Malme-3M, SK-mel5, SK-mel24 and SK-mel28) and NRAS mutated (M18, MZ2 and SK-mel2) melanoma cell lines, as well as wild-type controls (A7, CHL-1). We evaluated both basal activities (i.e., without treatment) and repair capacities after treatment with vemurafenib or cobimetinib alone, or in combination. Our results indicate that globally the DNA repair capacity of the cell lines was determined by the mutation status of the BRAF and NRAS genes, indicating that the MAPK pathway participates in the regulation of both BER and NER. Treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma cells with vemurafenib alone or the vemurafenib/cobimetinib combination, but not cobimetinib alone, led to reduced DNA repair capacity in about 60% of the BRAF mutated samples, indicating that signaling pathway inhibition can alter DNA repair activity. Upregulation of some DNA repair activities was also observed in several of the treated samples, suggesting activation of compensatory signaling pathways upon treatment. The data collectively indicate that mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes exert distinct regulatory effects on the excision/synthesis steps of the BER and NER pathways and that targeted pharmacological inactivation of the signaling mechanism can translate into specific consequences in DNA repair capacity. The heterogeneity of the responses reported herein could help define subtypes of melanoma that are associated with resistance to targeted therapies.","NA"

There has been no reported case of natural parthenogenesis, in which embryos develop from unfertilized oocytes. The genome and epigenetic information of haploid gametes are crucial for the proper development of embryos. Haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs) are unique stem cells established from uniparental blastocysts and possess only one set of chromosomes. Previous studies have shown that sperm or oocyte genome can be replaced by haESCs with or without manipulation of genomic imprinting for generation of mice. Recently, these remarkable semi-cloning methods have been applied for screening of key factors of mouse embryonic development. While haESCs have been applied as substitute of gametic genome, the fundamental mechanism how haESCs contribute to the genome of totipotent embryos is unclear.

Strong coastal upwelling events were observed during summer seasons of the period 2002-2008 between Punta Eugenia and Punta Abreojos. The upwelling plumes at Punta Abreojos are projected southward in slope waters bordering the coastal shelf of the Gulf of Ulloa, contributing to the separation of coastal and oceanic regions, and explain differences in amphipod diversity and abundances. In the offshore region, the most abundant species were Vibilia armata, Lestrigonus schizogeneios, Primno brevidens, and Eupronoe minuta, similar to previous findings in northern regions of Baja California and southern California. However, their abundances were lower (between 10 and 30 individuals/1000 m3), only reaching 20-50% of abundance levels reported off northern Baja California. In the coastal shelf of the Gulf of Ulloa, amphipods were virtually absent during 2002, 2003 and 2006. However, during 2004 and 2005, abundances of P. brevidens increased (54 and 20 ind/1000 m3, respectively). Moreover, during 2007, abundances of L. schizogeneios, P. brevidens, Lycaea nasuta, Lycaea pulex, and Simorhynchotus antennarius increased considerably (261, 39, 31, 68, 416 ind/1000 m3, respectively), indicating occasional utilization of the coastal shelf by pelagic amphipods. Gelatinous organisms paralleled changes in hyperiid populations and were particularly abundant in 2007 in the coastal shelf. Significant correlations of 17 amphipod species with gelatinous taxa, which are often used as host organisms by hyperiid amphipods, suggest that those organisms enhanced hyperiid abundance and promoted the progression onto the coastal shelf during some years of the 2002-2008 period.","NA"

Especially, small-size animals convert subtle difference in sensory input into orientation behavioral output for directly steering toward a destination, but the neural mechanisms underlying steering behavior remain elusive. Here, we analyze a C. elegans thermotactic behavior in which a small number of neurons are shown to mediate steering toward a destination temperature. We construct a neuroanatomical model and use an evolutionary algorithm to find configurations of the model that reproduce empirical thermotactic behavior. We find that, in all the evolved models, steering rates are modulated by persistent thermal signals sensed through forward locomotion. Persistent temperature increment lessens steering rates resulting in straight movement of model worms, whereas temperature decrement enlarges steering rates resulting in curvy movement. This relationship between temperature change and steering rates reproduces the empirical thermotactic migration up thermal gradients and steering bias toward higher temperature. Further, spectrum decomposition of neural activities in model worms show that thermal signals are transmitted from a sensory neuron to motor neurons on the longer time scale than sinusoidal locomotion of C. elegans. Our results suggest that employments of persistent sensory signals enable small-size animals to steer toward a destination in natural environment with variable, noisy, and subtle cues.

Author summaryA free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans memorizes an environmental temperature and steers toward the remembered temperature on a thermal gradient. How does the C. elegans brain, consisting of 302 neurons, achieve this thermotactic steering behavior? Here, we address this question through neuroanatomical modeling and simulation analyses. We find that persistent thermal input modulates steering rates of model worms; worms run straight when they move up to a destination temperature, whereas run crookedly when move away from the destination. As a result, worms steer toward the destination temperature as observed in experiments. Our analysis also shows that persistent thermal signals are transmitted from a thermosensory neuron to dorsal and ventral neck motor neurons, regulating the balance of dorsoventral muscle contractions of model worms and generating steering behavior. This study indicates that C. elegans can steer toward a destination temperature without processing acute thermal input that informs to which direction it should steer. Such indirect mechanism of steering behavior is potentially employed in other motile organisms.","NA"

The loss of spectrin generates an ectopic actin polymerization outside of the existing front and secondary membrane protrusions, leading to defective neuronal positioning and dendrite morphology in adult animals. Spectrin accumulates in the lateral and the rear of migrating neuroblasts and redistributes from the soma into the newly formed dendrites, indicating that the spectrin-based membrane skeleton is asymmetric and remodels to regulate actin assembly and cell shape during development.

Prospective transgenic approaches and genome editing strategies hold great promise for controlling insect populations as well as disease propagation. In this context, identifying visible genetic markers for transgenic methodologies is of paramount importance to advance the field. Here we have identified and analyzed the function of putative cuticle and eye color genes by investigating the effect of gene knockdown on fertility, viability, and the generation of visible phenotypes. Synthesis of the dark, yellow and tan pigments present in the cuticle of most insects depends on the function of key genes encoding enzymes in the tyrosine pathway. Knockdown of the R. prolixus yellow and aaNAT/pro orthologs produces striking alterations in cuticle color. Surprisingly, knockdown of ebony does not generate visible phenotypes. Since loss of ebony function results in a dark cuticle in several insect orders, we conclude that R. prolixus evolved alternative strategies for cuticle coloration, possibly including the loss of a pigmentation function for an entire branch of the tyrosine pathway. Knockdown of the scarlet and brown genes - encoding ABC transporters - alters cuticle and eye pigmentation, implying that the transport of pigment into proper organelles is an important process both for cuticle and eye coloration in this species. Therefore, this analysis identifies for the first time potential visible markers for transgenesis in a hemipteran vector for a debilitating human disease.

Author SummaryThe hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus - also known as a kissing bug - is a main vector transmitting the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, a debilitating infection estimated to affect more than 6 million people in Central and South America. In order to limit disease spread, an important measure is insect vector control. However, kissing bugs - like other insects - develop resistance to insecticides. Alternative strategies based on transgenesis and the recently developed CRISPR- based genome edition hold great promise to control vector population or generate parasite-resistant insects. For these approaches to be feasible in R. prolixus, it is critical to identify visible phenotypic markers. Here we identify and describe several genes controlling cuticle and eye pigmentation that are well-suited putative landing sites for transformation strategies. Among these, loss-of-function mutations in the ABC transporter encoding scarlet and the tyrosine pathway enzyme encoding aaNAT/pro generate striking and easily visible phenotypes. Importantly, the knockdown of these genes does not affect insect viability and fertility under laboratory conditions. Our results suggest that R. prolixus has developed alternative strategies for cuticle coloration involving the loss of an entire branch of tanning loci, while the other branch producing cuticle patterns by generating non-pigmented areas has gained critical importance.","NA"

Viral Papain-Like cysteine protease (PLpro, NSP3) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents a promising target for the development of antiviral drugs which would be facilitated by an understanding of its substrate specificity. Here, we used a combinatorial substrate library containing natural and a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids and performed comprehensive activity profiling of SARS-CoV-2-PLpro. We found that the P2 site of SARS-CoV-2-PLpro is highly specific for Gly, the P3 site exhibits a high degree of promiscuity, and the P4 site exhibits a preference for amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-PLpro harbors deubiquitinating activity. Both the substrate binding profile and deubiquitinating activity are shared with the highly related SARS-CoV-PLpro which harbors near identical S4-S2 binding pockets. On the scaffold of best hits from positional scanning we have designed optimal fluorogenic substrates and irreversible inhibitors with a high degree of selectivity for SARS PLpro variants versus other proteases. Altogether this work has revealed the molecular rules governing PLpro substrate specificity and provides a framework for development of inhibitors with potential therapeutic value or drug repositioning.","NA"

Starting from the available structural data on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor, we here engineered a mini-protein with the aim of creating a soluble and stable Spike interactor. This mini-protein, which was recombinantly produced in high yields, possesses a stable  helical conformation and is able to interact with the RBD of glycosylated Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar affinity, as measured by microscale thermophoresis. By plugging the Spike protein, our mini-protein constitutes a valid tool for the development of treatments against different types of coronavirus.","NA"

We revealed that both proteins were highly decorated with specific proportions of N-glycan subtypes.

The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is an already proven target for acute experimental stroke intervention and was hypothesized to also contribute to neuroinflammation-mediated impairment of recovery during the subacute phase. Neflamapimod, an orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant, potent and selective small molecule p38 inhibitor was evaluated as a subacute phase stroke treatment to promote recovery in this research study. Neflamapimod administration at two clinically relevant dose levels was initiated outside of the previously characterized neuroprotection window of less than 24 hours after stroke for p38 inhibitors to rats after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Continuous administration of neflamapimod, starting at 48 hours after reperfusion, significantly improved behavioral outcomes assessed by the modified neurological severity score at four- and six-weeks post stroke in a dose-dependent manner. Neflamapimod also demonstrated beneficial effects on additional measures of sensory and motor function and resulted in a dose-related increase in the terminal brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein level in both the injured and uninjured brain hemisphere. Variable interleukin-1{beta} levels were detected in the injured brain hemisphere at study termination in a subset of the animals within every test group, implying ongoing, chronic inflammation, however, no clear neflamapimod effect on interleukin-1{beta} production was observable. The dose-related in vivo efficacy of neflamapimod offers the possibility of both expanding the window for initiation of therapy after stroke and for improving recovery after a completed stroke.

In the grasses, a duplication generated two paralogs designated as CONSTANS 1 (CO1) and CONSTANS 2 (CO2). Here we show that in tetraploid wheat plants grown under LD, combined loss-of-function mutations in the A and B-genome homeologs of CO1 and CO2 (co1 co2) result in a small (3 d) but significant (P<0.0001) acceleration of heading time both in PHOTOPERIOD1 (PPD1) sensitive (Ppd-A1b) and insensitive (Ppd-A1a) backgrounds. Under short days (SD), co1 co2 mutants headed 13 d earlier than the wild type (P<0.0001) in the presence of Ppd-A1a. However, in the presence of Ppd-A1b, spikes from both genotypes failed to emerge by 180 d. These results indicate that CO1 and CO2 operate mainly as weak heading time repressors in both LD and SD. By contrast, in the absence of functional PPD1 alleles (ppd1), Co1 accelerated heading time >60 d relative to co1 under LD. We detected significant genetic interactions among CO1, CO2 and PPD1 alleles on heading time, which were reflected in complex interactions among these genes at the transcriptional and protein levels. Loss-of-function mutations in PPD1 had a stronger effect on heading time than combined co1 co2 mutations and, more importantly, PPD1 was able to perceive and respond to differences in photoperiod in the absence of functional CO1 and CO2 genes. Similarly, CO1 was able to accelerate heading time in response to LD in the absence of a functional PPD1. Taken together, these results indicate that PPD1 and CO1 are able to respond to photoperiod in the absence of each other, and that interactions between these two photoperiod pathways at the transcriptional and protein levels are important to fine-tune the flowering response in wheat.

Author summaryAn understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of wheat heading time is required to engineer more productive varieties better adapted to new or changing environments. A large proportion of wheats natural variation in heading time is determined by differences in genes controlling the photoperiodic response. In this study, we show that the wheat PHOTOPERIOD1 (PPD1) gene has a stronger effect on heading time than CONSTANS1 (CO1) and CO2 in the regulation of the photoperiodic response, and that complex genetic interactions among these genes are important to fine-tune heading time. Using loss-of-function mutants for both CO1 and CO2, we demonstrate that these genes are not required for PPD1 to perceive differences in photoperiod and regulate heading time. Similarly, we show that in the absence of PPD1, CO1 can accelerate heading time more than 60 days in response to long days. Our results indicate that each of these two wheat photoperiod pathways can respond to differences in photoperiod even in the absence of the other one. Differences in the relative importance of these two pathways and in their epistatic interactions have contributed to the diversity of photoperiodic responses observed in different grass species.","NA"

We applied novel, quantitative and widely applicable cytogenetic strategies to elucidate the molecular bases of this organization using C. elegans. Analyses of WT chromosomes and de novo circular mini-chromosomes revealed that meiosis-specific HORMA-domain proteins assemble into cohorts in defined numbers and co-organize the axis together with two functionally-distinct cohesin complexes (REC-8 and COH-3/4) in defined stoichiometry. We further found that REC-8 cohesins, which load during S phase and mediate sister chromatid cohesion, usually occur as individual complexes, supporting a model wherein sister cohesion is mediated locally by a single cohesin ring. REC-8 complexes are interspersed in an alternating pattern with cohorts of axis-organizing COH-3/4 complexes (averaging three per cohort), which are insufficient to confer cohesion but can bind to individual chromatids, suggesting a mechanism to enable formation of asymmetric sister chromatid loops. Indeed, immuno-FISH assays demonstrate frequent asymmetry in genomic content between the loops formed on sister chromatids. We discuss how features of chromosome axis/loop architecture inferred from our data can help to explain enigmatic, yet essential, aspects of the meiotic program.","NA"

Integrating in silico predictions with in vitro and in vivo assays, we describe a novel interaction between pVHL and mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2). Importantly, we found that pVHL30, and not pVHL19, forms a complex with MDM2, and that the N-terminal acidic tail of pVHL30 is required for its association with MDM2. Further, we demonstrate that an intrinsically disordered region upstream of the tetramerization domain of MDM2 is responsible for its isoform-specific association with pVHL30. This region is highly conserved in higher mammals, including primates, similarly to what has been already proposed for the N-terminal tail of pVHL30. Finally, we show that overexpression of pVHL30 and MDM2 together reduces cell proliferation, suggesting a synergistic effect of these E3 ubiquitin ligases. Collectively, our data support the idea that pVHL30 plays a role in MDM2 regulation, suggesting a wider interplay among hypoxia sensing and cell cycle regulation.","NA"

Mouse models are available but show less severe symptoms. In both humans and mice it has remained elusive which of the symptoms can be attributed to lack of plasmanyl or plasmenyl ether lipids. The latter compounds, better known as plasmalogens, harbor a vinyl ether double bond conferring special chemical and physical properties. Discrimination between plasmanyl and plasmenyl ether lipids is a major analytical challenge, especially in complex lipid extracts with many isobaric species. Consequently, these lipids are often neglected also in recent lipidomic studies. Here we present a comprehensive LC-MS/MS based approach that allows unequivocal distinction of these two lipid subclasses based on their chromatographic properties. The method was validated using a novel plasmalogen-deficient mouse model which lacks plasmanylethanolamine desaturase and therefore cannot form plasmenyl ether lipids.

Metastasis, in particular, is often the limiting step in the survival to cancer, yet our understanding of how tumor cells escape the vascular system to initiate metastatic sites remains limited. Using an in vitro model of the human microvasculature, we assess here the importance of the tumor and vascular glycocalyces during tumor cell extravasation. Through selective manipulation of individual components of the glycocalyx, we reveal a novel mechanism whereby tumor cells prepare an adhesive vascular niche by depositing components of the glycocalyx along the endothelium. Accumulated hyaluronic acid shed by tumor cells subsequently mediates adhesion to the endothelium via the glycoprotein CD44. Trans-endothelial migration and invasion into the stroma occurs through binding of the isoform CD44v to components of the sub-endothelial extra-cellular matrix. Targeting of the hyaluronic acid-CD44 glycocalyx complex results in significant reduction in the extravasation of tumor cells. These studies provide evidence of tumor cells repurposing the glycocalyx to promote adhesive interactions leading to cancer progression. Such glycocalyx-mediated mechanisms may be therapeutically targeted to hinder metastasis and improve patient survival.","NA"

SIAH is a major tumor vulnerability in multidrug-resistant and incurable cancer. SIAH inhibition is an effective strategy to shut down the tumor-driving K-RAS/EGFR/HER2 pathway activation that promotes malignant tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. To further delineate the SINA function in the RAS/EGFR pathway, a genetic modifier screen was conducted, and 28 new sina mutant alleles were isolated via ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and X-ray mutagenesis. Among them, 26 of the new sina mutants are embryonic, larval, or pupal lethal, and stronger than the five published sina mutants (sina1, sina2, sina3, sina4, and sina5) which are early adult lethal.

Reformulation of ZFEL in a proportional or geometric reference frame indicates that when entities evolve randomly and independently, differences smaller than any initial difference are balanced by differences larger than the initial difference.

However, the etiologies contributing to stability and change in DNA methylation have rarely been examined longitudinally.

MethodsWe considered DNA methylation in whole blood leukocyte DNA across a 10-year span in two samples of same-sex aging twins: (a) Swedish Adoption Twin Study of Aging (SATSA; N = 53 pairs, 53% female; 62.9 and 72.5 years, SD=7.2 years); (b) Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins (LSADT; N = 43 pairs, 72% female, 76.2 and 86.1 years, SD=1.8 years). Joint biometrical analyses were conducted on 358,836 methylation probes in common. Bivariate twin models were fitted, adjusting for age, sex and country.

ResultsOverall, results suggest genetic contributions to DNA methylation across 358,836 sites tended to be small and lessen across 10 years (broad heritability M=23.8% and 18.0%) but contributed to stability across time while person-specific environments explained emergent influences across the decade. Aging-specific sites identified from prior EWAS and methylation age clocks were more heritable than background sites. The 5,037 sites that showed the greatest heritable/familial influences (p<1E-07) were enriched for immune and inflammation pathways while 2,020 low stability sites showed enrichment in stress-related pathways.

ConclusionsAcross time, stability in methylation is primarily due to genetic contributions, while novel experiences and exposures contribute to methylation differences. Elevated genetic contributions at age-related methylation sites suggest that adaptions to aging and senescence may be differentially impacted by genetic background.

Key messagesO_LIIndividual differences in late-life methylation are due partly to genetic influences which contribute to stability in methylation patterns across late life.
C_LIO_LIEnvironmental experiences unique to individuals contribute to new influences on methylation patterns across late life.
C_LIO_LIAge-related CpG sites show greater heritable influences on methylation consistent with genetic regulation of biological aging rates.

We demonstrate the value of PerSort to isolate translationally dormant cells that pre-exist in small numbers within Mycobacterium spp. cultures growing under optimal conditions, but which dramatically increased in proportion under stress conditions. The translationally dormant subpopulation exhibited multidrug tolerance and regrowth properties consistent with persister cells. Furthermore, PerSort enabled single-cell transcriptional profiling that provided evidence that the translationally dormant persisters were generated through a variety of mechanisms, including vapC30, mazF, and relA/spoT overexpression. Finally, we demonstrate that notwithstanding the varied mechanisms by which the persister cells were generated, they converge on a similar low oxygen metabolic state that was reversed through activation of respiration to rapidly eliminate persisters fostered under host-relevant stress conditions. We conclude that PerSort provides a new tool to study MTB persisters, enabling targeted strategies to improve and shorten the treatment of TB.

SummaryWe have developed a novel method, PerSort, to isolate translationally dormant cells that pre-exist in small numbers within Mycobacterium spp. cultures growing under naive conditions (i.e., absence of antibiotic treatment), but dramatically increase in proportion under stress conditions. The translationally dormant cells have high tolerance to isoniazid and rifampicin, and can regenerate the parental population structure in standard media, albeit after a significantly longer lag phase, indicating they are persister cells. Single-cell expression profiling demonstrated that the translationally dormant persister subpopulation is a mixture of vapC30, mazF, and relA/spoT overexpressing cells, indicating there are multiple pathways to become a persister cell. Regardless of the mechanism by which they are generated, the persister cells have reduced oxidative metabolism, which is reversed upon addition of L-cysteine to effect complete clearance by INH and RIF under host-related stress.","NA"

In many rod-shaped bacteria a dynamic protein system, termed the Min system, acts as a central regulator of division site placement. The Min system is best studied in Escherichia coli where it shows a remarkable oscillation from pole to pole with a time-averaged density minimum at midcell. Several components of the Min system are conserved in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. However, in B. subtilis it is believed that the system forms a stationary bipolar gradient from the cell poles to midcell. Here, we show that the Min system of B. subtilis localizes dynamically to active sites of division, often organized in clusters. We provide physical modelling using measured diffusion constants that describe the observed enrichment of the Min system at the septum. Modelling suggests that the observed localization pattern of Min proteins corresponds to a dynamic equilibrium state. Our data provide evidence for the importance of ongoing septation for the Min dynamics, consistent with a major role of the Min system to control active division sites, but not cell pole areas.","NA"

We also explored the effect of surface cleaning on microbial resettling. Finally, we studied passenger behavior and characterized microbial changes after traveling.

Most passengers (99%), showed some type of surface interaction during a wagon trip, mostly with the hands (92%). We found microbiome differences associated with surfaces, probably reflecting diverse surface materials and usage frequency. The platform floor was the most bacterial diverse surface, while the stair handrail and pole were the least diverse ones. After pole cleaning, the resettling of microbial diversity was fast (5-30 minutes); however, it did not resemble the initial composition.

After traveling, passengers significantly increased their hand microbial diversity and converged to a similar microbial composition among passengers. Additionally, passenger hand microbiomes resembled subway surfaces in diversity and also in the frequency of potentially pathogenic taxa.

During both isolation and phenotyping, we varied conditions in ways relevant in nature (pH, temperature, bile). This revealed local abiotic conditions modified expression of resistance against both the antibiotic used during isolation and other antibiotics.

These results place collateral sensitivity in the context of environmental variation, with important implications for translation to real-world applications.","NA"

Its pivotal component, TssA, is indispensable for the assembly of the T6SS sheath structure, the contraction of which propels a payload of effector proteins into neighboring cells. Despite their key function, TssA proteins exhibit unexpected diversity and exist in two major forms, a short (TssAS) and a long (TssAL) TssA. Whilst TssAL proteins interact with a partner, called TagA, to anchor the distal end of the extended sheath, the mechanism for the stabilization of TssAS-containing T6SSs remains unknown. Here we discover a novel class of structural components that interact with short TssA proteins and contribute to T6SS assembly by stabilizing the polymerizing sheath from the baseplate. We demonstrate that the presence of these components is important for full sheath extension and optimal firing. Moreover, we show that the pairing of each form of TssA with a different class of sheath stabilization proteins results in T6SS apparatuses that either reside in the cell for a while or fire immediately after sheath extension, thus giving rise to different aggression behaviors. We propose that this functional diversity could contribute to the specialization of the T6SS to suit bacterial lifestyles in diverse environmental niches.","NA"

However, the effective contribution of AbaR to antibiotic resistance and bacterial physiology remains elusive. To address this, we exploited natural transformation to accurately remove AbaR islands and restore the integrity of their insertion site. We performed this genetic modification in two recent A. baumannii clinical strains: the strain AB5075 and the nosocomial strain AYE which carry AbaR11 and AbaR1 islands of 19.7 kbp and 86.2 kbp, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibilities were then compared between the parental strains and their AbaR-cured derivatives. As anticipated by the predicted function of the ORF of this island, the antibiotic resistance profiles were identical between the wild-type and the AbaR11-cured strain. In contrast, AbaR1 carries 25 ORFs with a predicted resistance to several classes of antibiotics and the AbaR1-cured derivative showed restored susceptibility to multiple classes of antibiotics. Moreover, curing of AbaRs restored high levels of natural transformability. Indeed, most AbaR islands are inserted into the comM gene involved in natural transformation. Our data indicate that AbaR insertion effectively inactivates comM and that the restored comM is functional. Curing of AbaR consistently resulted in highly transformable, and therefore, easily genetically tractable strains.","NA"

The current study is the first examining associations between dimensions from a hierarchical structure and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) networks.

MethodsUsing 9-11-year-old children from the ABCD baseline sample, we compared the variance explained by each hierarchy level (p-factor, 2-factor, 3-factor, 4-factor, and 5-factor models) in RSFC. Analyses were first conducted in a discovery dataset (n=3790) with significant associations examined in a replication dataset (n=3791).

ResultsThe current study found associations between p-factor and lower connectivity within default mode network (DMN), although stronger effects emerged for the neurodevelopmental factor. Neurodevelopmental impairments were related to variation in RSFC networks associated with attention to internal states and external stimuli. These networks included within DMN, DMN with cingulo-opercular (CON) and  Other (Unassigned) networks, CON with ventral attention and  Other network, and dorsal attention with  Other network. Results held when accounting for parental psychopathology.

ConclusionThe hierarchical structure of psychopathology showed replicable links to RSFC alterations in middle childhood. The p-factor had minimal association with altered connectivity, while the specific neurodevelopmental dimension showed robust associations with multiple RSFC impairments. Results show the utility of examining associations between intrinsic brain architecture and specific dimensions of psychopathology, revealing associations specifically with neurodevelopmental impairments.","NA"

In this study, we investigated how L-DOPA affects gene expression in the frontal cortex in an animal model of unilateral PD. We performed an RNA-seq analysis of gene expression in the frontal cortex of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced unilateral dopaminergic lesion that were treated with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), for 2 weeks. We used analysis of variance to identify differentially expressed genes and found 48 genes with significantly altered transcript abundance after L-DOPA treatment. We also performed a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), which resulted in the detection of 5 modules consisting of genes with similar expression patterns. The analyses led to three primary observations. First, the changes in gene expression induced by L-DOPA were bilateral, although only one hemisphere was lesioned. Second, the changes were not restricted to neurons but also appeared to emerge in immune or endothelial cells. Finally, comparisons with databases of drug-induced gene expression signatures revealed multiple nonspecific effects, which indicates that a part of the observed response is a common pattern activated by multiple types of pharmaceuticals in different target tissues.

Haploinsufficiency of EHMT1, encoding a histone methyl-transferase, is associated with several NDDs, including Kleefstra syndrome, developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Using a mouse model of Ehmt1 haploinsufficiency (Ehmt1D6Cre/+), we examined a number of brain and behavioural endophenotypes of relevance to NDDs. Specifically, we show that Ehmt1D6Cre/+ mice have deficits in information processing, evidenced by abnormal sensory-motor gating, a complete absence of object recognition memory and a reduced magnitude of auditory evoked potentials in both paired-pulse inhibition and mismatch negativity (MMN). The electrophysiological experiments show that differences in magnitude response to auditory stimulus were associated with marked reductions in total and evoked beta- and gamma-band oscillatory activity, as well as significant reductions in phase synchronisation. The pattern of electrophysiological deficits in Ehmt1D6Cre/+ matches those seen in control mice following administration of the selective NMDA-R antagonist, ketamine. This, coupled with reduction of Grin1 mRNA expression in Ehmt1D6Cre/+ hippocampus, suggests that Ehmt1 haploinsufficiency may lead to disruption in NMDA-R. Taken together, these data indicate that reduced Ehmt1 dosage during forebrain development leads to abnormal circuitry formation, which in turn results in profound information processing deficits. Such information processing deficits are likely paramount to our understanding of the cognitive and neurological dysfunctions shared across the NDDs associated with EHMT1 haploinsufficiency.","NA"

MethodsAs a total of 50 eligible obese (mean BMI 32 {+/-} 4.31) female adults (mean age 48 {+/-} 5.38 years), we randomly allocated 40 participants to either calorie-restricted modified MIND diet or a calorie-restricted standard control diet. Change in cognitive performance was the primary outcome measured with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. We also performed voxel-based morphometry as a secondary outcome to quantify the differences in brain structure. All of the measurements administered at baseline and three months of study.

ResultsThirty-seven participants (MIND group=22 and control group=15) completed the study.

Using a validated computational pipeline, candidate ketamine-response genes and regulatory RNAs from published literature, binding affinity studies, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genomewide association studies (GWAS), we identified 108 SNPs associated with 110 genes and regulatory RNAs. All of these SNPs are classified as enhancers, and additional chromatin interaction mapping in human neural cell lines and tissue shows enhancer-promoter interactions involving other network members. Pathway analysis and gene set optimization identified three composite sub-networks within the broader ketamine pharmacogenomic network. Expression patterns of ketamine network genes within the postmortem human brain are concordant with ketamine neurocircuitry based on the results of 24 published functional neuroimaging studies. The ketamine pharmacogenomic network is enriched in forebrain regions known to be rapidly activated by ketamine, including cingulate cortex and frontal cortex, and is significantly regulated by ketamine (p=6.26E-33; Fishers exact test). The ketamine pharmacogenomic network can be partitioned into distinct enhancer sub-networks associated with: (1) glutamate neurotransmission, chromatin remodeling, smoking behavior, schizophrenia, pain, nausea, vomiting, and post-operative delirium; (2) neuroplasticity, depression, and alcohol consumption; and (3) pharmacokinetics. The component sub-networks explain the diverse action mechanisms of ketamine and its analogs.

Mechanistically, isoplumbagin exerts its cytotoxic effect through acting as a substrate of NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) to generate hydroquinone, which reverses mitochondrial fission phenotype, reduces mitochondrial complex IV activity and thus compromises mitochondrial function. Collectively, this work reveals an anti-cancer activity of isoplumbagin mainly through modulating mitochondrial dynamics and function.

Dopamine exerts its role via activation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the ventral striatum. Upregulation of dopamine D2R in the indirect pathway of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) impairs incentive motivation via inhibiting synaptic transmission to the ventral pallidum. Here, we determined whether upregulation of D2Rs and the resulting impairment in indirect pathway function modulates associative learning in an auditory Pavlovian reward learning task as well as Go/No-Go learning in an operant based reward driven Go/No-Go task. We found that upregulation of D2Rs in indirect pathway neurons of the NAc did not affect Pavlovian learning or the extinction of Pavlovian responses, and neither did it alter No-Go learning. A delay in the Go component of the task however could indicate a deficit in learning though it may be attributed to locomotor hyperactivity of the mice. In combination with previously published findings our data suggest that D2Rs in the NAc core play a specific role in regulating motivation by balancing cost/benefit computations but do not necessarily affect associative learning.","NA"

G6PD deficiency has been associated with hemolysis. Clinically, G6PD deficiency is asymptomatic and the clinical manifestations occur with the exposure to certain agents. Due to the lack of suitable animal models that can predict the clinical hemolytic potential of drugs, it needs an appropriate research model to fully recapitulate the manifestations of G6PD deficiency in clinic, to optimize the malaria therapy and promote anti-malarias development. The present study has displayed a stable transgenic Tg(zgata1-g6pdM118-144-egfp) zebrafish model with G6PD deficiency which mimics the clinical features of G6PD deficiency phenotypically and functionally. The findings showed that there was an inadequate level of reduced GSH in the transgenic Tg(zgata1-g6pdM118-144-egfp) zebrafish line in the presence or absence of -naphthol, compared to the wildtype zebrafish, indicating an attenuation of g6pd activity in the transgenic zebrafish line. In addition, the observations show that there is a less abundance of g6pd in the transgenic Tg(zgata1-g6pdM118-144-egfp) zebrafish line. On the other hand, there is no morphological abnormality in the transgenic Tg(zgata1-g6pdM118-144-egfp) zebrafish line. Taken together, our work has delivered a novel stable transgenic zebrafish model of G6PD deficiency that will facilitate the mechanistic and functional elucidation for the role of G6PD in erythrocytic pathophysiology.

As the main reason, we have identified the unavailability of a technique which allows to follow the temporal dynamics of RNA transcripts in human cell culture. Here, we present a NAIL-MS (nucleic acid isotope labeling coupled mass spectrometry) scheme for efficient stable isotope labeling in both RNA and DNA (>95% within 7 days) in common human cell lines and growth media. Validation experiments reveal that the labeling procedure itself does neither interfere with the isotope dilution MS quantification nor with RNA modification density. We design pulse chase NAIL-MS experiments and apply the new tool to study the temporal placement of modified nucleosides in e.g. tRNAPhe and 18S rRNA. In existing RNAs, we observe a constant loss of modified nucleosides over time which is masked by a post-transcriptional methylation mechanism and thus not detectable without NAIL-MS. During alkylation stress, NAIL-MS reveals an adaptation of tRNA modifications in new transcripts but not existing transcripts.

Overall, we present a fast and reliable stable isotope labeling strategy which allows a more detailed study of RNA modification dynamics in human cell culture. With cell culture NAIL-MS it is finally possible to study the speed of both modification and demethylation reactions inside human cells. Thus it will be possible to study the impact of external stimuli and stress on human RNA modification kinetics and processing of mature RNA.","NA"

The source of such polymers is uncertain, but previous investigations reported that wet-dry cycles simulating prebiotic hot springs provide sufficient energy to drive condensation reactions of mononucleotides to form oligomers3. The aim of the study reported here was to visualize the products by atomic force microscopy. In addition to globular oligomers, ring-like structures ranging from 10-200 nm in diameter with an average around 30-40 nm were abundant, particularly when nucleotides capable of base pairing were present. The thickness of the rings was consistent with single stranded products, but some had thicknesses indicating base pair stacking. Others had more complex structures in the form of short polymer attachments and pairing of rings. These observations suggest the possibility that template-directed synthesis may occur during wet-dry cycling followed by solvation of the rings. We conclude that RNA-like rings and structures could have been synthesized non-enzymatically on the prebiotic Earth with sizes sufficient to fold into ribozymes and genetic molecules required for life to begin.","NA"

Several post-translational modifications occur during capacitation, including sialylation, which despite being limited to a few proteins, seems to be essential for proper sperm-oocyte interaction. Regardless of its importance, to date, no single study has ever identified nor quantified which glycoproteins bearing terminal sialic acid (Sia) are altered during capacitation. Here we characterize sialylation during mouse sperm capacitation. Using tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS), we found 142 non-reductant peptides, with 9 of them showing potential modifications on their sialylated oligosaccharides during capacitation. As such, N-linked sialoglycopeptides from C4b-binding protein, endothelial lipase (EL), serine proteases 39 and 52, testis-expressed protein 101 and zonadhesin were reduced following capacitation. In contrast, mitochondrial aconitate hydratase (aconitase; ACO2) was the only protein to show an increase in Sia content during capacitation. Interestingly, while the loss of Sia within EL (N62) was accompanied by a reduction in its phospholipase A1 activity, the increase of sialylation in the ACO2 (N612) also resulted in a decrease of the activity of this TCA cycle enzyme. The latter was confirmed by N612D recombinant protein with both His and GFP tag, in which the N612D mutant had no activity compared to WT when protein. Computer modelling show that N612 sits atop the catalytic site of ACO2. The introduction of sialic acid causes a large confirmation change in the alpha helix, essentially, distorting the active site, leading to complete loss of function. These findings suggest that the switch from oxidative phosphorylation, over to glycolysis that occurs during capacitation may come about through sialylation of ACO2.","NA"

This model however does not explain how molecular information is interpreted by cells to modulate their rearrangement into somites. Here we performed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) on the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) of chicken embryos at stages 11-12 to describe in detail the cell shape changes occurring along the axis of the PSM. This reveals a wave of epithelialization of the dorsal PSM that precedes somite segmentation. Signs of spatially periodic apical constriction appear in this layer starting at least 3-4 somite lengths caudal to the most recently formed somite. The sizes of these clusters correspond to the typical diameter of chicken somites. We propose that a mechanical instability process leads to the separation of cells into these structures and positions the future inter-somite boundaries. We present a model in which a wave of apical constriction leads to increasing tension and periodic failure of adhesion junctions within the dorsal epithelial layer of the PSM, thus positioning somite boundaries. This model can produce spatially periodic segments whose size depends on the speed of the contraction wave (W) and the rate of increase of apical contractility ({Lambda}). The {Lambda}/W ratio determines whether this mechanism produces spatially and temporally regular or irregular segments, and whether segment sizes increase with the wave speed (scaling) as in the CW model. We discuss the limitations of a purely mechanical model of somite segmentation and the role of biomechanics along with CW during somitogenesis.","NA"

Using the Land Use Harmonization dataset (3) as the basis for ecological niche modelling, we quantify modelled changes in global suitable habitat over the past three centuries for Asian elephants, a megaherbivore representing diverse biomes. Between 1700-2015 over 60% of habitat suitable for elephants was lost, while average patch size declined 84-86%, and the largest patch decreased from 45% to 5%. Over half of the currently inhabited range is considered unsuitable for elephants, whereas suitable habitat is predicted to decline further from 2015-2099 across all six scenarios representing a range of emissions pathways and socioeconomic narratives. However, results vary by region and scenario in a non-linear manner, indicating that socioeconomic outcomes are as important as emissions pathways for the future of these habitats. Lao PDR, Thailand and Myanmar currently have lower elephant populations relative to the amount of available habitat. On the other hand, continued losses in densely settled areas such as India and Sri Lanka are expected to exacerbate human-elephant conflict. Only a few regions, notably peninsular Malaysia, Borneo, and Yunnan province, China, are predicted to have potential for habitat recovery. The most catastrophic losses across all range states occurred under a scenario of mid-range emissions but high regional inequities, leading to overexploitation of critical habitats. We conclude that steps to mitigate climate change must be taken alongside measures to ensure inter-regional social equity in order to safeguard these landscapes for elephants, humans and other species.

SignificanceHuman land-use change is a leading driver of biodiversity loss, but effects are difficult to quantify over centennial timescales. Asian elephants occupy diverse biomes that have long been impacted by human activities and are thus indicative of the fates of numerous co-existing species. Over 60% of suitable elephant habitat has been lost since the 1700s and over half of the currently inhabited range may be considered unsuitable. Declines are predicted to continue to 2099 under six scenarios of global change across the majority of elephant range states, with the worst losses corresponding to a scenario representing mid-range emissions but high global inequity. Thus climate change mitigation strategies must include measures to facilitate equitable societies to safeguard and recover elephant landscapes, together with the unique biodiversity they represent.","NA"

We have been carrying out evolutionary experiments aimed at elucidating the dynamics of genetic adaptation under LTSP. We showed that Escherichia coli adapts to prolonged resource exhaustion through the highly convergent acquisition of mutations. In the most striking example of such convergent adaptation, we observed that across all independently evolving LTSP populations, over 90% of E. coli cells carry mutations to one of three specific sites of the RNA polymerase core enzyme (RNAPC). These LTSP adaptations reduce the ability of the cells carrying them to grow once fresh resources are again provided. Here, we examine how LTSP populations recover from costs associated with their adaptation, once resources are again provided to them. We demonstrate that due to the ability of LTSP populations to maintain high levels of standing genetic variation during adaptation, costly adaptations are very rapidly purged from the population once they are provided with fresh resources. We further demonstrate that recovery from costs acquired during adaptation under LTSP occurs much more rapidly than would be possible if LTSP adaptations had fixed during the time populations spent under resource exhaustion. Finally, we previously reported that under LTSP, some clones develop a mutator phenotype, greatly increasing their mutation accumulation rates. Here, we show that the mechanisms, by which populations recover from costs associated with fixed adaptations, may depend on mutator status.","NA"

There is evidence for altered DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with schizophrenia in both brain and peripheral tissues. We aimed to undertake a systematic analysis of variable DNAm associated with psychosis, schizophrenia, and treatment-resistant schizophrenia, also exploring measures of biological ageing, smoking, and blood cell composition derived from DNAm data to identify molecular biomarkers of disease.

MethodsWe quantified DNAm across the genome in blood samples from 4,483 participants from seven case-control cohorts including patients with schizophrenia or first-episode psychosis. Measures of biological age, cellular composition and smoking status were derived from DNAm data using established algorithms. DNAm and derived measures were analyzed within each cohort and the results combined by meta-analysis.

ResultsPsychosis cases were characterized by significant differences in measures of blood cell proportions and elevated smoking exposure derived from the DNAm data, with the largest differences seen in treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients. DNAm at 95 CpG sites was significantly different between psychosis cases and controls, with 1,048 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) identified between schizophrenia cases and controls. Schizophrenia-associated DMPs colocalize to regions identified in genetic association studies, with genes annotated to these sites enriched for pathways relevant to disease. Finally, a number of the schizophrenia associated differences were only present in the treatment-resistant schizophrenia subgroup.

ConclusionsWe show that DNAm data can be leveraged to derive measures of blood cell counts and smoking that are strongly associated with psychosis. Our DNAm meta-analysis identified multiple DMPs associated with both psychosis and a more refined diagnosis of schizophrenia, with evidence for differential methylation associated with treatment-resistant schizophrenia that potentially reflects exposure to clozapine.","NA"

The affected cholangiocytes that line the intrahepatic biliary tract are considered to be the cell of origin of this malignancy. Here, we investigated interactions among a human cholangiocyte cell line, H69, a CCA cell line CC-LP-1, CagA+ve Helicobacter pylori, and H. bilis bacilli. Exposure to increasing numbers of H. pylori at 0, 1, 10,100 bacteria per H69 cell for 24 hrs induced phenotypic changes in the cultured cholangiocytes including profusion of thread-like filopodia and loss of cell-cell contact in a dose-dependent fashion. In parallel, changes in mRNA expression followed exposure to H. pylori, with increased expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated-factors including snail, slug, vimentin, matrix metalloprotease, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox, and the cancer stem cell marker CD44. Transcription levels encoding the cell adhesion marker CD24 decreased. Analysis in real time using the xCELLigence system to quantify cell proliferation, migration and invasion revealed that exposure to 10 to 50 of H. pylori stimulated migration of H69 cells and CC-LP-1 cells, a line derived form of a human cholangiocarcinoma, and invasion through an extracellular matrix. In addition, 10 bacilli of CagA+ve H. pylori, but not H. bilis, stimulated contact-independent colony establishment in soft agar. These findings support the hypothesis that infection with H. pylori can contribute to the malignant transformation of the biliary epithelium.","NA"

To find strategies toward an HIV cure, detailed understandings of the molecular mechanisms underlying establishment and persistence of the reservoirs are needed. The cellular transcription factor KAP1 is known as a potent repressor of gene transcription. Here we report that KAP1 represses HIV-1 gene expression in myeloid cells including microglial cells, the major reservoir of the central nervous system. Mechanistically, KAP1 interacts and colocalizes with the viral transactivator Tat to promote its degradation via the proteasome pathway and repress HIV-1 gene expression. In myeloid models of latent HIV-1 infection, the depletion of KAP1 increased viral gene elongation and reactivated HIV-1 expression. Bound to the latent HIV-1 promoter, KAP1 associates and cooperates with CTIP2, a key epigenetic silencer of HIV-1 expression in microglial cells. In addition, Tat and CTIP2 compete for KAP1 binding suggesting a dynamic modulation of the KAP1 cellular partners upon HIV-1 infection. Altogether, our results suggest that KAP1 contributes to the establishment and the persistence of HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells.","NA"

LRRK2 is expressed in both neurons and glia in the central nervous system, but its physiological function(s) in each of these cell types is uncertain. Through sequential screens, we report a functional interaction between LRRK2 and Clathrin adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2). Analysis of LRRK2 KO tissue revealed a significant dysregulation of AP2 complex components, suggesting LRRK2 may act upstream of AP2. In line with this hypothesis, expression of LRRK2 was found to modify recruitment and phosphorylation of AP2. Furthermore, expression of LRRK2 containing the R1441C pathogenic mutation resulted in impaired clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). A decrease in activity-dependent synaptic vesicle endocytosis was also observed in neurons harboring an endogenous R1441C LRRK2 mutation. Alongside LRRK2, several PD-associated genes intersect with membrane-trafficking pathways. To investigate the genetic association between Clathrin-trafficking and PD, we used polygenetic risk profiling from IPDGC genome wide association studies (GWAS) datasets. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis genes were found to be associated with PD across multiple cohorts, suggesting common variants at these loci represent a cumulative risk factor for disease.

Though retinotopic organization was present during both perception and memory, large systematic differences in tuning were also evident. Notably, whereas there was a three-fold decline in spatial precision from early to late visual areas during perception, this property was entirely abolished during memory retrieval. This difference could not be explained by reduced signal-to-noise or poor performance on memory trials. Instead, by simulating top-down activity in a network model of cortex, we demonstrate that this property is well-explained by the hierarchical structure of the visual system.

Recent studies using human samples and experimental modeling suggest that glutathione redox metabolism and heterogeneity play a role in disease pathogenesis. We sought to dissect the mechanistic basis of liver redox variation and explore how other stress responses affect cholangiocyte injury in BA.

METHODSWe performed quantitative in situ hepatic glutathione redox mapping in zebrafish larvae carrying targeted mutations in glutathione metabolism genes and correlated these findings with sensitivity to the plant-derived BA-linked toxin biliatresone. We also determined whether genetic disruption of HSP90 protein quality control pathway genes implicated in human BA altered biliatresone toxicity in zebrafish and human cholangiocytes. An in vivo screen of a known drug library was performed to identify novel modifiers of cholangiocyte injury in the zebrafish experimental BA model with subsequent validation.

RESULTSGlutathione metabolism gene mutations caused regionally distinct changes in the redox potential of cholangiocytes that differentially sensitized them to biliatresone. Disruption of human BA-implicated HSP90 pathway genes sensitized zebrafish and human cholangiocytes to biliatresone-induced injury independent of glutathione. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i) and other cGMP signaling activators worked synergistically with the glutathione precursor N- acetylcysteine (NAC) in preventing biliatresone-induced injury in zebrafish and human cholangiocytes.

CONCLUSIONRegional variation in glutathione metabolism underlies sensitivity to the biliary toxin biliatresone, and mirrors recently reported BA risk stratification linked to glutathione metabolism gene expression.

Participants decided which box, left or right, contained more dots and then reported their confidence in this decision. In Experiment 1, prior to confidence rating, participants were required to follow a motor cue. Cued-response type was manipulated in two dimensions: task-compatibility (the relation between response set and task-relevant decision alternatives), and stimulus-congruence (spatial correspondence between response key and the location of the stimulus that should be chosen). In Experiment 2, a decision-related response set was randomly varied in each trial, being either vertical (task incompatible) or horizontal (task-compatible, spatially congruent and incongruent). The main results showed that choice confidence increased following task-compatible responses, i.e. responses related to the alternatives of the choice in which confidence was reported. Moreover, confidence was higher in these conditions, independently of response accuracy and spatial congruence with the  correct stimuli. We interpret these results as suggesting that action appropriate in the context of a given task is an indicator of successful completion of the decision-related process.

A subset of Cas9 orthologs were purified and their activities examined further exposing additional biochemical diversity. This constituted both narrow and broad ranges of temperature dependence, staggered-end DNA target cleavage, and a requirement for longer stretches of homology between gRNA and DNA target to function robustly.

Many temperate hybrid zones are formed by the secondary contact between two parental populations that had undergone post-glacial range expansion. Here we show that explicitly accounting for historical parental isolation followed by range expansion prior to secondary contact is fundamental for explaining genetic and fitness patterns in these hybrid zones. Specifically, ancestral population expansion can result in allele surfing, neutral or slightly deleterious mutations drift high frequency at the front of the expansion. If these surfed deleterious alleles are recessive, they can contribute to substantial heterosis in hybrids produced at secondary contact, counteracting negative-epistatic interactions between BDMI loci and hence can deteriorate reproductive isolation. Similarly, surfing at neutral loci can alter the expected pattern of population ancestry and suggests that accounting for historical population expansion is necessary to develop accurate null genomic models in secondary-contact hybrid zones. Furthermore, this process should be incorporated in macroevolutionary models of divergence as well, since such heterosis facilitated by parental-range expansion could dampen genomic divergence established in the past.","NA"

Virus neutralization tests are a gold standard serological diagnostic, but requirements for large volumes of serum and high biosafety containment can limit widespread use. Here, focusing on Rabies lyssavirus, a globally important zoonosis, we developed a pseudotype micro-neutralization rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (pmRFFIT) that overcomes these limitations. Specifically, we adapted an existing micro-neutralization test to use a green fluorescent protein-tagged murine leukemia virus pseudotype in lieu of pathogenic rabies virus, reducing the need for specialized reagents for antigen detection and enabling use in low-containment laboratories. We further used statistical analysis to generate rapid, quantitative predictions of the probability and titer of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies from microscopic imaging of neutralization outcomes. Using 47 serum samples from domestic dogs with neutralizing antibody titers estimated using the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVN), pmRFFIT showed moderate sensitivity (78.79%) and high specificity (84.62%). Despite small conflicts, titer predictions were correlated across tests repeated on different dates both for dog samples (r = 0.93), and for a second dataset of sera from wild common vampire bats (r = 0.72, N = 41), indicating repeatability. Our test uses a starting volume of 3.5 L of serum, estimates titers from a single dilution of serum rather than requiring multiple dilutions and end point titration, and may be adapted to target neutralizing antibodies against alternative lyssavirus species. The pmRFFIT enables high-throughput detection of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies in low-biocontainment settings and is suited to studies in wild or captive animals where large serum volumes cannot be obtained.","NA"

It is widely accepted, however, that membrane voltage potentiates aminoglycoside activity, which is ascribed to voltage dependent drug uptake. In this paper, we measured the single cell response of Escherichia coli treated with aminoglycosides and discovered that the bactericidal action arises not from the downstream effects of voltage dependent drug uptake, but rather directly from dysregulated membrane potential. In the absence of voltage, aminoglycosides are taken into cells and exert bacteriostatic effects by inhibiting translation. However, cell killing was immediate upon re-polarization. The hyperpolarization arose from altered ATP flux, which induced a reversal of the F1Fo-ATPase to hydrolyze ATP and generated the deleterious voltage. Heterologous expression of an ATPase inhibitor from Salmonella completely eliminated bactericidal activity, while loss of the F-ATPase significantly reduced the electrophysiological response to aminoglycosides. Our data support a model of voltage induced death, which could be resolved in real-time at the single cell level, and separates the mechanisms of aminoglycoside bacteriostasis and bactericide in E. coli.","NA"

In these cancers and in most infected B-cells, EBV maintains a state of latency, where nearly 80 lytic cycle antigens are epigenetically suppressed. To gain insights into host epigenetic factors necessary for EBV latency, we recently performed a human genome-wide CRISPR screen that identified the chromatin assembly factor CAF1 as a putative Burkitt latency maintenance factor. CAF1 loads histones H3 and H4 onto newly synthesized host DNA, though its roles in EBV genome chromatin assembly are uncharacterized. Here, we identified that CAF1 depletion triggered lytic reactivation and transforming virion secretion from Burkitt cells, despite strongly also inducing interferon stimulated genes. CAF1 perturbation diminished occupancy of histones 3.1, 3.3 and repressive H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks at multiple viral genome lytic cycle regulatory elements. Suggestive of an early role in establishment of latency, EBV strongly upregulated CAF1 expression in newly infected primary human B-cells prior to the first mitosis, and histone 3.1 and 3.3 were loaded on the EBV genome by this timepoint. Knockout of CAF1 subunit CHAF1B impaired establishment of latency in newly EBV-infected Burkitt cells. A non-redundant latency maintenance role was also identified for the DNA synthesis-independent histone 3.3 loader HIRA. Since EBV latency also requires histone chaperones ATRX and DAXX, EBV coopts multiple host histone pathways to maintain latency, and these are potential targets for lytic induction therapeutic approaches.

IMPORTANCEEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) was discovered as the first human tumor virus in endemic Burkitt lymphoma, the most common childhood cancer in sub-Saharan Africa. In Burkitt lymphoma and in 200,000 EBV-associated cancers per year, epigenetic mechanisms maintain viral latency, where lytic cycle factors are silenced. This property complicated EBVs discovery and facilitates tumor immunoevasion. DNA methylation and chromatin-based mechanisms contribute to lytic gene silencing. Here, we identify histone chaperones CAF1 and HIRA, which have key roles in host DNA replication-dependent and replication independent pathways, respectively, are each important for EBV latency. EBV strongly upregulates CAF1 in newly infected B-cells, where viral genomes acquire histone 3.1 and 3.3 variants prior to the first mitosis. Since histone chaperones ATRX and DAXX also function in maintenance of EBV latency, our results suggest that EBV coopts multiple histone pathways to reprogram viral genomes and highlights targets for lytic induction therapeutic strategies.","NA"

In separate blocks of trials, participants were asked to attend to sound frequency or sound location and ignore the change in the task-irrelevant feature. In both attend-frequency and attend-location tasks, response times were slower when the task-irrelevant feature changed than when it stayed the same (involuntary orienting).

This congruency effect was associated with enhanced activity in the prefrontal cortex, and was greater in the right STG and medial frontal cortex during the attend-location than during the attend-frequency task.

In adults, fMRI has been used to develop multivariate brain activity signatures, which reliably capture elements of human pain experience. We translate whole-brain fMRI signatures that encode pain perception in adults to the newborn infant brain, to advance understanding of functional brain development and pain perception in early life.

MethodsA cohort of adults (n=10; mean age=28.3 years) and 2 cohorts of healthy infants (Cohort A: n=15; Cohort B: n=22; mean postnatal age=3 days) were stimulated with low intensity nociceptive stimuli (64-512mN) during acquisition of functional MRI data. fMRI pain signatures were applied directly to the adult data and transformed such that they could be applied to the infant brain. In each cohort, we assessed the concordance of the signatures with the brain responses using cosine-similarity scores, and we assessed stimulus intensity encoding of the signature responses using Spearman rank correlation. Brain activity in  pro-pain and  anti-pain brain regions were also examined.

FindingsThe Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS), which reflects aspects of nociceptive pain experience, was activated in both the adults and infants, and reliably encoded stimulus intensity. However, the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature (SIIPS1), which reflects higher-level cognitive modulation of nociceptive input, was only expressed in adults.  Pro-pain brain regions showed similar activation patterns in adults and infants, whereas,  anti-pain brain regions exhibited divergent responses.

InterpretationBasic intensity encoding of nociceptive information is similar in adults and infants. However, translation of adult brain signatures into infants reveals significant differences in infant cerebral processing of nociceptive information, which may reflect their lack of expectation, motivation and contextualisation. This study expands the use of brain activity pain signatures to non-verbal patients and provides a potential approach to assess analgesic interventions in infancy.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for research articles published prior to March 2020 using terms including  fMRI,  infant or neonate, and  pain or nociception in the title or abstract. Due to the relatively new emergence of this field, and the experimental and analytical challenges involved in studying cerebral processing of pain in the MRI environment in healthy newborn infants, only five fMRI studies have examined infant brain responses to nociceptive input.

In a foundational pilot study, Williams et al., applied an experimental noxious stimulus to a single infant, evoking widespread brain activity that included several brain regions involved in pain processing in adults. Goksan et al., subsequently performed an observational cohort study and used regional analyses to compare active brain regions in infants (n=10) and adults (n=10), concluding that the evoked patterns of brain activity were broadly similar in infants and adults. Further follow-up analysis in the infant cohort revealed that the functional connectivity of brain regions involved in descending pain modulation influences the magnitude of pain-related brain activity. Two further studies focused on methodological advances, providing evidence-based recommendations for fMRI acquisition parameters and image processing in order to maximise the quality of infant data, and these methods have been implemented in this study.

Added value of this studyThis study translates validated adult pain fMRI brain signatures to a nonverbal patient population in which the assessment and management of pain presents a significant clinical challenge. Application of fMRI brain signatures to newborn infants expands on previous fMRI studies that provided only qualitative evidence that noxious stimulation commonly activates brain regions in the adult and infant brain. Here we demonstrate that the basic encoding of the sensory discriminative aspects of pain, as represented by the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS), occurs in both adults and infants, whereas higher-level cognitive modulation of pain, represented by the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature (SIIPS1) is only present in adults and not observed in infants. The differences in how the immature infant brain processes pain, relative to the mature adult brain, are likely to reflect differences in their expectation, motivation and contextualisation of external events rather than differences in their core nociceptive cerebral processing of pain. This work allows us to use quantitative fMRI observations to make stronger inferences related to pain experience in nonverbal infants.

Implications of all the available evidenceBehavioural pain scores used in neonatal clinical care offer limited sensitivity and specificity to pain. Neonatal clinical trials that use these scores as outcome measures frequently report a lack of efficacy of common analgesic interventions, resulting in few evidence-based drugs for treating pain. The value of using brain-based neuroimaging markers of pain as a means of providing objective evidence of analgesic efficacy in early proof of concept studies is well recognised in adults, even in the absence of behavioural pain modulation. Similarly, in infants EEG-based measures of noxious-evoked brain activity have been used as outcome measures in clinical trials of analgesics to overcome some of the inherent limitations of using behavioural observations to quantify analgesic efficacy. Considering the successful translation of the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) and its sensitivity to analgesic modulation in adults, this novel methodology represents an objective brain-based fMRI approach that could be used to advance the discovery and assessment of analgesic interventions in infancy.","NA"

We show using quasi-simultaneous imaging and optogenetics that this reward response plasticity is sculpted by medial thalamic inputs to OFC.

To assess how well plant fossils reflect the actual vegetation of the FPS, we assigned fossil-taxa to biomes providing a measure for environmental heterogeneity. Additionally, the palynological assemblage was compared to pollen spectra from modern lake sediments to assess biases in spore/pollen representation in the pollen record. We found a close match of the Vegora assemblage with modern Fagus-Abies forests of Turkey. Using taxonomic affinities of leaf fossils, we further established close similarities of the Vegora assemblage with modern laurophyllous oak forests of Afghanistan. Finally, using information from sedimentary environment and taphonomy, we distinguished local and distantly growing vegetation types. We then subjected the plant assemblage of Vegora to different methods of climate reconstruction and discussed their potentials and limitations. Leaf and spore/pollen records allow accurate reconstructions of palaeoenvironments in the FPS, whereas extra-regional vegetation from coastal lowlands is likely not captured.","NA"

Here, we investigated a sister species pair of Israeli cave whip spiders (Arachnopulmonata, Amblypygi, Charinus) of which one species has reduced eyes. We generated the first embryonic transcriptomes for Amblypygi, and discovered that several RDGN homologs exhibit duplications.

A differential gene expression (DGE) analysis comparing the expression of RDGN genes in field-collected embryos of both species identified candidate RDGN genes involved in the formation and reduction of eyes in whip spiders.

When cues provide information about the state of the environment, organisms can use them to respond flexibly. Thus information can provide fitness advantages. Without environmental cues, an organism can reduce the risks of environmental uncertainty by hedging its bets across different scenarios. Risk mitigation is then possible by adopting a life-history of bet-hedging, either randomly switching between phenotypes (diversifying bet-hedging) or adopting intermediate phenotypes (conservative bet-hedging). Hence, understanding patterns of bet-hedging is necessary in order to quantify the fitness benefit of environmental cues, since it provides a baseline fitness in the absence of informative cues. Quantifying fitness benefits in terms of mutual information reveals deep connections between Darwinian evolution and information theory. However, physiological constraints or complex ecological scenarios often lead to the number of environmental states to exceed that of potential phenotypes, or a single intermediate phenotype is adopted, as in the case of conservative bet-hedging. Incorporating these biological complexities, we generalise the relationship between information theory and Darwinian fitness. Sophisticated bet-hedging strategies combining diversifying and conservative bet-hedging - can then evolve. We show that, counterintuitively, environmental complexity can reduce, rather than increase, the number of phenotypes that an organism can adopt. In conclusion, we develop an information-theoretic extensible approach for investigating and quantifying fitness in ecological studies.","NA"

The comparison of marine foams, SML and underlying water collected from the North Sea and Timor Sea showed that foams were often characterized by highest abundance of small phototrophic and prokaryotic cells as well as highest concentrations of surface-active substances (SAS). Amplicon sequencing based on 16S rRNA revealed a comparable bacterial community in SML and foam. DNA and rRNA based sequence data suggest that Pseudoalteromonas, a typical member of the SML, was highly active and thus might enhance foam formation and stability by producing SAS. Although foams contained some specific taxa, our study supports the hypothesis that foam represents a compressed version of the SML. Foam is characterized by increased cell numbers, high SAS concentration, and a significant fraction of overlapping bacteria with SML. Due to the compressed nature of foam and SML compared to the underlying water, bacteria thriving in both surface phenomena have likely implications for biogeochemical cycling and air-sea exchange processes.

Methods aimed at deciphering the effective connections between neurons from extracellular spike recordings would increase utility of in-vitro local neural circuits, especially for studies of human neural development and disease based on induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). Current techniques allow statistical inference of functional couplings in the network but are fundamentally unable to correctly identify indirect and apparent connections between neurons, generating redundant maps with limited ability to model the causal dynamics of the network. In this paper, we describe a novel mathematically rigorous, model-free method to map effective - direct and causal - connectivity of neuronal networks from multi-electrode array data. The inference algorithm uses a combination of statistical and deterministic indicators which, first, enables identification of all existing functional links in the network and then, reconstructs the directed and causal connection diagram via a super-selective rule enabling highly accurate classification of direct, indirect and apparent links. Our method can be generally applied to the functional characterization of any in-vitro neuronal networks. Here, we show that, given its accuracy, it can offer important insights into the functional development of in-vitro iPSC-derived neuronal cultures by reconstructing their effective connectivity, thus facilitating future efforts to generate predictive models for neurological disorders, drug testing and neuronal network modeling.","NA"

It is a complex issue, but in vitro assays and physicochemical properties of compounds can be used to predict clinical toxicity. Neural networks (NNs) are a popular predictive tool due to their flexibility and ability to model non-linearities, but they are prone to overfitting and therefore are not recommended for small data sets. Furthermore, they dont provide uncertainty in the predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are able to avoid these pitfalls by using prior distributions on the parameters of a NN model and representing uncertainty about the predictions in the form of a distribution. We model the severity of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) to provide an example of a BNN performing better than a traditional but less flexible proportional odds logistic regression (POLR) model. We use appropriate metrics to evaluate predictions of the ordinal data type. To demonstrate the effect of a hierarchical prior for BNNs as an alternative to hyperparameter optimisation for NNs, we compare the performance of a BNN against NNs with dropout or penalty regularisation. We reduce the task to multiclass classification in order to be able to perform this comparison. A BNN trained for the multiclass classification produces poorer results than a BNN that captures the order. To our knowledge, this is the first BNN applied to toxicity prediction. The current work lays a foundation for more complex models built on larger datasets, but can already be adopted by safety pharmacologists for risk quantification.","NA"

Biomolecular condensates are condensed fluid droplets in cells that form by liquid-liquid phase separation of intrinsically-disordered proteins. They have a wide range of functions and are associated with chronic neurodegenerative diseases in which they become pathologically rigid. Intrinsically-disordered proteins are conformationally flexible and possess multiple, distributed binding sites for each other or for RNA. However, it remains unclear how their material properties depend on the molecular structure of the proteins. Here we use coarse-grained simulations to explore the phase behavior and structure of a model biomolecular condensate composed of semi-flexible polymers with attractive end-caps in a good solvent. Although highly simplified, the model contains the minimal molecular features that are sufficient to observe liquid-liquid phase separation of soluble polymers. The polymers condense into a porous, three-dimensional network in which their end-caps reversibly bind at junctions. The spatial separation of connected junctions scales with the polymer backbone length as a self-avoiding random walk over a wide range of concentration with a weak affinity-dependent prefactor. By contrast, the average number of polymers that meet at the junctions depends strongly on the end-cap affinity but only weakly on the polymer length. The regularity and porosity of the condensed network suggests a mechanism for cells to regulate biomolecular condensates. Interaction sites along a protein may be turned on or off to modulate the condensates porosity and tune the diffusion and interaction of additional proteins.","NA"

In cyanobacteria and some eukaryotic phytoplankton, the production of resting stages is accompanied by a loss of photosynthetic pigments, a process termed chlorosis. Here, we show that a chlorosis-like process occurs under multiple stress conditions in axenic laboratory cultures of Prochlorococcus, the dominant phytoplankton linage in large regions of the oligotrophic ocean and a global key player in ocean biogeochemical cycles. In Prochlorococcus strain MIT9313, chlorotic cells show reduced metabolic activity, measured as C and N uptake by NanoSIMS. However, unlike many other cyanobacteria, chlorotic Prochlorococcus cells are not viable and do not re-grow under axenic conditions when transferred to new media. Nevertheless, co-cultures with a heterotrophic bacterium, Alteromonas macleodii HOT1A3, allowed Prochlorococcus to survive nutrient starvation for months. We propose that reliance on co-occurring heterotrophic bacteria, rather than the ability to survive extended starvation as resting cells, underlies the ecological success of Prochlorococcus.

ImportanceThe ability of microorganisms to withstand long periods of nutrient starvation is key to their survival and success under highly fluctuating conditions as is common in nature. Therefore, one would expect this trait to be prevalent among organisms in the nutrient-poor open ocean. Here, we show that this is not the case for Prochlorococcus, a globally abundant and ecologically impactful marine cyanobacterium. Instead, Prochlorococcus rely on co-occurring heterotrophic bacteria to survive extended phases of nutrient and light starvation.

To deconvolve the different functions for KHARON, we have identified two partner proteins, KHAP1 and KHAP2, that associate with KHARON. KHAP1 is located only in the subpellicular microtubules, while KHAP2 is located at the subpellicular microtubules and the base of the flagellum.

Although reward circuits promote the consumption of palatable food their involvement in obesity remains unclear. The ventral pallidum (VP) is a key hub in the reward system that encodes the hedonic aspects of palatable food consumption and participates in various proposed feeding circuits. However, there is still no evidence for its involvement in developing diet-induced obesity. Here we examine, using male C57bl6/J mice and patch-clamp electrophysiology, how chronic high-fat-high-sugar (HFHS) diet changes the physiology of the VP and whether mice that gain the most weight differ in their VP physiology from others. We found that 10-12 weeks of HFHS diet decreased the excitability of VP neurons, but without major change in synaptic inhibitory input. Within the HFHS group, obesity-prone (OP, top 33% weight gainers) mice had a less excitable VP compared to obesity-resistant (OR, bottom 33% weight gainers) mice and showed short- and long-term potentiation of incoming inhibitory inputs. Moreover, we found that long-term potentiation of the inhibitory inputs to the VP may exist in OP mice before exposure to HFHS and may thus serve as a marker for the predisposition to become obese. These data point to the VP as a critical player in obesity and suggest that hypoactivity in the VP may play a significant role in promoting overeating of palatable food.","NA"

Preclinical rodent models of adolescent stress have produced varying results that are species, strain, sex, and laboratory-dependent. However, adolescent social isolation is a potent stressor in humans that has been reliably modeled in male rats, increasing adult anxiety-like and alcohol drinking behaviors, among others. In this study, we examined the generalizability and sex-dependence of this model in C57BL/6J mice, the most commonly used rodent strain in neuroscience research. We also performed a parallel study using social isolation in adulthood to understand the impact of adult social isolation on basal behavioral phenotypes. We found that six weeks of social isolation in adolescence beginning at postnatal day (PD) 28 produced a hypersocial phenotype in both male and female adults in multiple assays and a female-specific anxiolytic phenotype in the elevated plus maze, but it had no effects in other assays for avoidance behavior, fear conditioning, alcohol drinking, reward or aversion sensitivity, novel object exploration, or forced swim behavior in either sex. In contrast, social isolation in adulthood beginning at PD77 produced an anxiogenic phenotype in the light/dark box but had no effects on any other assays. Altogether, our results suggest that 1) adolescence is a critical period for social stress in C57BL/6J mice, producing aberrant social behavior in a sex-independent manner and 2) chronic individual housing in adulthood does not alter basal behavioral phenotypes that may confound interpretation of behavior following other laboratory manipulations.","NA"

Instructors (always with regular sleep, RS) were asked to teach numerical reasoning strategies to learners (either SD or RS), during which the activity of both brains was simultaneously recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). SD learners initially performed below their baseline level, worse than RS learners, but learning improvement was comparable between RS and SD conditions after learning with the instructor. IBS within the instructor-learner dyads was higher in the SD (vs. RS) condition in the left inferior frontal cortex. In addition, clustered IBS (estimated by nonnegative matrix factorization) was correlated with performance improvement. Finally, Granger Causality analyses revealed biased causality with higher instructor-to-learner than learner-to-instructor directionality in brain signal processing. Together, these results indicate that SD-related learning deficits can to some extent be compensated via interactions with an instructor, as reflected by increased IBS and preserved learning ability. It suggests an essential role of the instructor in driving synchrony between teaching and SD learning brains during interactions.","NA"

Investigating astrocyte maturation in a cell culture model revealed that in vitro-differentiated astrocytes lacked expression of many mature astrocyte-specific genes, including genes for the transcription factors Rorb, Dbx2, Lhx2 and Fezf2. Forced expression of these factors in vitro induced distinct sets of mature astrocytes-specific transcripts. Culturing astrocytes with FGF2 in a three-dimensional gel induced expression of Rorb, Dbx2 and Lhx2 and improved their maturity based on transcriptional and chromatin profiles. Therefore extrinsic signals orchestrate the expression of multiple intrinsic regulators, which in turn induce in a modular manner the transcriptional and chromatin changes underlying astrocyte maturation.","NA"

Here we performed a comparative 16S rRNA gene survey of the rhizosphere of 4 domesticated and 20 wild barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes grown in an agricultural soil under controlled environmental conditions.

Our results revealed a footprint of the hosts adaptation to the environment on the assembly of the bacteria thriving at the root-soil interface. In the tested conditions, this recruitment cue layered atop of the distinct evolutionary trajectories of wild and domesticated plants and, at least in part, is encoded by the barley genome.

The distribution and abundance of B. halleriana and C. hellerianus was surveyed, releves sampled to record habitat and community composition, and sporophyte frequency and stage of development measured. Light climate of B. halleriana was investigated via hemispherical photography, and abundance of large rotten logs used as a measure of habitat quality for C. hellerianus.

Results and discussionFour subpopulations of B. halleriana occur, comprising 21 individual-equivalents (occupied 1 m grid cells), all on mildly base-rich mudstone of north-facing rockfaces, with very little direct solar radiation and a diverse assemblage of bryophytes. Sporophyte are scarce. A total of 143 individual-equivalents (occupied logs or trees) of C. hellerianus was recorded, an exceptional population in Wales. Most of the population is within Allt Rhyd Groes, where large rotten logs are much more abundant due to greater woodland age. The liverwort mainly occupied the sides of decorticated rotten logs, amongst a sparse community composed mainly of other small liverworts and Cladonia lichens. Neither sporophytes nor perianths were found.

Escherichia coli has been used as a model organism in experimental evolution studies for years; specifically, we and others have used it to study evolution in complex environments by incubating the cells into long-term stationary phase (LTSP) in rich media. In LTSP, cells experience a variety of stresses and changing conditions. While we have hypothesized that this experimental system is more similar to natural environments than some other lab conditions, we do not yet know how cells respond to this environment biochemically or physiologically. In this study, we begin to unravel the cells responses to this environment by characterizing the transcriptome of cells during LTSP. We found that cells in LTSP have a unique transcriptional program, and that several genes are uniquely upregulated or downregulated in this phase. Further, we identified two genes, cspB and cspI, which are most highly expressed in LTSP, even though these genes are primarily known to respond to cold-shock. When competed with wild-type cells, these genes are also important for survival during LTSP. These data allow us to compare biochemical responses to multiple environments and identify useful model systems, identify gene products that may play a role in survival in this complex environment, and identify novel functions of proteins.

ImportanceExperimental evolution studies have elucidated evolutionary processes, but usually in chemically well-defined and/or constant environments. Using complex environments is important to begin to understand how evolution may occur in natural environments, such as soils or within a host. However, characterizing the stresses cells experience in these complex environments can be challenging. One way to approach this is by determining how cells biochemically acclimate to heterogenous environments. In this study we begin to characterize physiological changes by analyzing the transcriptome of cells in a dynamic complex environment. By characterizing the transcriptional profile of cells in long-term stationary phase, a heterogenous and stressful environment, we can begin to understand how cells physiologically and biochemically react to the laboratory environment, and how this compares to more natural conditions.","NA"

However, the rules governing how postsynaptic cells differentiate between presynaptic inputs are unclear. In this study we characterized synaptic interactions following manipulations of Ib tonic or Is phasic glutamatergic motoneurons that co-innervate postsynaptic muscles at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). After identifying drivers for each neuronal subtype, we performed ablation or genetic manipulations to alter neuronal activity and examined the effects on synaptic innervation and function. Ablation of either Ib or Is resulted in decreased muscle response, with some functional compensation occurring in the tonic Ib input when Is was missing. In contrast, the phasic Is terminal failed to show functional or structural changes following loss of the co-innervating Ib input. Decreasing the activity of the Ib or Is neuron with tetanus toxin light chain resulted in structural changes in muscle innervation. Decreased Ib activity resulted in reduced active zone (AZ) number and decreased postsynaptic subsynaptic reticulum (SSR) volume, with the emergence of filopodial-like protrusions from synaptic boutons of the Ib input. Decreased Is activity did not induce structural changes at its own synapses, but the co-innervating Ib motoneuron increased the number of synaptic boutons and AZs it formed. These findings indicate tonic and phasic neurons respond independently to changes in activity, with either functional or structural alterations in the tonic motoneuron occurring following ablation or reduced activity of the co-innervating phasic input, respectively.

Significance StatementBoth invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems display synaptic plasticity in response to behavioral experiences, indicating underlying mechanisms emerged early in evolution. How specific neuronal classes innervating the same postsynaptic target display distinct types of plasticity is unclear. Here, we examined if Drosophila tonic Ib and phasic Is motoneurons display competitive or cooperative interactions during innervation of the same muscle, or compensatory changes when the output of one motoneuron is altered. We established a system to differentially manipulate the motoneurons and examined the effects of cell-type specific changes to one of the inputs. Our findings indicate Ib and Is motoneurons respond differently to activity mismatch or loss of the co-innervating input, with the tonic subclass responding robustly compared to phasic motoneurons.","NA"

We applied a cross-modal integration and clustering approach called  Similarity Network Fusion, which combined two brain morphometrics (i.e., cortical thickness and myelin-surrogate markers), and key environmental factors (i.e., trauma exposure, neighborhood safety, school environment, and family environment) to identify homogeneous subtypes. Depending on the subtyping resolution, results identified two or five subgroups, each characterized by distinct brain structure-environment profiles.

These subtypes were highly reproducible and predicted externalizing symptoms and overall mental health problems.

How the stability of histone marks is maintained still remains unclear. The core histones can be degraded by the atypical proteasome, which contains the proteasome activator PA200, in an acetylation-dependent manner during somatic DNA damage response and spermiogenesis. Here we show that PA200 promotes the transcription-coupled degradation of the core histones, and plays an important role in maintaining the stability of histone marks. Degradation of the histone variant H3.3, which is incorporated into chromatin during transcription, was much faster than that of its canonical form H3.1, which is incorporated during DNA replication. This degradation of the core histones could be suppressed by the transcription inhibitor, the proteasome inhibitor or deletion of PA200. The histone deacetylase inhibitor accelerated the degradation rates of H3 in general, especially its variant H3.3, while the mutations of the putative acetyl-lysine-binding region of PA200 abolished histone degradation in the G1-arrested cells, supporting that acetylation is involved in the degradation of the core histones. Deletion of PA200 dramatically altered deposition of the active transcriptional hallmarks (H3K4me3 and H3K56ac) and transcription, especially during cellular aging. Furthermore, deletion of PA200 or its yeast ortholog Blm10 accelerated cellular aging. Notably, the PA200-deficient mice displayed a range of aging-related deteriorations, including immune malfunction, anxiety-like behaviors and shorter lifespan.

The marked heterogeneity in its clinical manifestations is a major obstacle in finding targeted treatments and involvement of multiple immune cell types further increases this complexity. Thus, identifying molecular subtypes that best correlate with disease heterogeneity and severity as well as deducing molecular cross-talk among major immune cell types that lead to disease progression are critical steps in the development of more informed therapies for SLE. Here we profile and analyze gene expression of six major circulating immune cell types from patients with well-characterized SLE (classical monocytes (n=64), T cells (n=24), neutrophils (n=24), B cells (n=20), conventional (n=20) and plasmacytoid (n=22) dendritic cells) and from healthy control subjects. Our results show that the interferon (IFN) response signature was the major molecular feature that classified SLE patients into two distinct groups: IFN-signature negative (IFNneg) and positive (IFNpos). We show that the gene expression signature of IFN response was consistent (i) across all immune cell types, (ii) all single cells profiled from three IFNpos donors using single-cell RNA-seq, and (iii) longitudinal samples of the same patient. For a better understanding of molecular differences of IFNpos versus IFNneg patients, we combined differential gene expression analysis with differential Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), which revealed a relatively small list of genes from classical monocytes including two known immune modulators, one the target of an approved therapeutic for SLE (TNFSF13B/BAFF: belimumab) and one itself a therapeutic for Rheumatoid Arthritis (IL1RN: anakinra). For a more integrative understanding of the cross-talk among different cell types and to identify potentially novel gene or pathway connections, we also developed a novel gene co-expression analysis method for joint analysis of multiple cell types named integrated WGNCA (iWGCNA). This method revealed an interesting cross-talk between T and B cells highlighted by a significant enrichment in the expression of known markers of T follicular helper cells (Tfh), which also correlate with disease severity in the context of IFNpos patients. Interestingly, higher expression of BAFF from all myeloid cells also shows a strong correlation with enrichment in the expression of genes in T cells that may mark circulating Tfh cells or related memory cell populations. These cell types have been shown to promote B cell class-switching and antibody production, which are well-characterized in SLE patients. In summary, we generated a large-scale gene expression dataset from sorted immune cell populations and present a novel computational approach to analyze such data in an integrative fashion in the context of an autoimmune disease. Our results reveal the power of a hypothesis-free and data-driven approach to discover drug targets and reveal novel cross-talk among multiple immune cell types specific to a subset of SLE patients. This approach is immediately useful for studying autoimmune diseases and is applicable in other contexts where gene expression profiling is possible from multiple cell types within the same tissue compartment.","NA"

Here, impact of low concentrations of multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) on the biofilm-forming opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is studied. Using phase contrast and confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and antibiotic tolerance assays, it is found that sub-lethal concentrations (2 mg/L) of MWCNTs promote aggregation of P. aeruginosa into multicellular clusters. However, the antibiotic tolerance of these ""young"" bacterial-CNT aggregates is similar to that of CNT-free cultures.

The lasR gene, which encodes a central quorum-sensing regulator, is frequently mutated, and loss of LasR function impairs the activity of downstream regulators RhlR and PqsR. We found that in diverse models, the presence of P. aeruginosa wild type causes LasR loss-of-function strains to hyperproduce RhlR/I-regulated antagonistic factors, and autoinducer production by the wild type is not required for this effect. We uncovered a reciprocal interaction between isogenic wild type and lasR mutant pairs wherein the iron-scavenging siderophore pyochelin, specifically produced by the lasR mutant, induces citrate release and cross-feeding from wild type. Citrate stimulates RhlR signaling and RhlI levels in LasR-but not in LasR+ strains, and the interactions occur in diverse media. Co-culture interactions between strains that differ by the function of a single transcription factor may explain worse outcomes associated with mixtures of LasR+ and LasR loss-of-function strains. More broadly, this report illustrates how interactions within a genotypically diverse population, similar to those that frequently develop in natural settings, can promote net virulence factor production.","NA"

Here, a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screen in intestinal epithelial cells with the prototypical intracellular bacterial pathogen Salmonella led us to discover that type I interferon (IFN-I) remodels lysosomes. Even in the absence of infection, IFN-I signaling modified the localization, acidification, protease activity and proteomic profile of lysosomes. Proteomic and genetic analyses revealed that multiple IFN-I-stimulated genes including Ifitm3, Slc15a3, and Cnp contribute to lysosome acidification. IFN-I-dependent lysosome acidification stimulated intracellular Salmonella virulence gene expression, leading to rupture of the Salmonella-containing vacuole and host cell death. Moreover, IFN-I signaling promoted in vivo Salmonella pathogenesis in the intestinal epithelium, where Salmonella initiates infection. Our findings explain how an intracellular bacterial pathogen co-opts epithelial IFN-I signaling. We propose that IFN-I control of lysosome function broadly impacts host defense against diverse viral and microbial pathogens.","NA"

In fact, the immune system, besides protecting the host from developing tumors, can support the CRC progression. In this scenario, the gut microbiota (GM) is essential to modulate immune responses and a dysbiotic condition can favor chronic/abnormal immune activation that support the tumor growth. GM can elicit the production of cytokines, influencing the immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive reactions, such as the tendency to mount Th1, Th17, Tregs or Th9 responses that play different roles towards colon cancer. Paradigmatic is the role of IL-9 that can both promote tumor progression in hematological malignancies and inhibit tumorigenesis in solid cancers. Therefore, to investigate the microbiota-immunity axis in CRC patients is crucial to well understand the cancer development with positive relapses in prevention and treatment.

AimThe cellular and molecular characterization of the immune response and the evaluation of GM composition in healthy and tumor mucosa, focusing on the correlation between cytokines profile and GM signature.

MethodsWe collected tumoral (CRC) and healthy (CRC-S) mucosa samples of 45 CRC patients. For each sample, we characterized the Tissue Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL)s subset profile and the GM composition. In addition, in 14 CRC patients, we evaluated the CRC and CRC-S molecular inflammatory response (26 cytokines/chemokines) and we correlated this profile with GM composition using the Dirichlet Multinomial Regression.

ResultsThe analysis of T cells subsets distribution showed that CRC samples displayed higher percentages of Th17, Th2, Tregs, Tc17, Tc1/Tc17, and Tcreg, compared to CRC-S. Notably, also the number of Th9 was higher, even if not significantly, in CRC tissue compared to healthy one. In addition, we found that MIP-1, IL-1{beta}, IL-2, IP-10, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, IFN-{gamma}, TNF-, MCP-1, IL-1, P-selectin and IL-9 were significantly increased in CRC compared to CRC-S. Moreover, the GM analysis revealed that CRC samples had significantly higher levels of Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacterium, Ruminococcus2 (Lachnospiraceae family) and Ruminococcus (Ruminococcaceae family) than CRC-S. Finally, we found that the abundance of Prevotella spp in CRC samples was negatively correlated with IL-17A and positively with IL-9. In addition, the abundance of Bacteroides and Escherichia/Shigella species in CRC samples showed a negative association with IL-9 and IP-10 respectively.

ConclusionsOur data show a clear dissimilarity of inflammatory profile and GM composition between the tumor and the adjacent healthy tissue, displaying the generation of a peculiar CRC microenvironment. Interestingly, relating the tissue cytokine profile with the GM composition, we confirmed the presence of a bidirectional crosstalk between the immune response and the hosts commensal microorganisms; in detail, we documented for the first time that Prevotella spp. and Bacteroides spp. are correlated (positively and negatively, respectively) with the IL-9, whose role in CRC development is still debated.","NA"

Ignoring overlapping contig ends may result in genes and other features being incomplete or fragmented in the resulting scaffolds. We developed the application AnVIL to generate scaffolds from genome drafts using 10X Chromium data, with a focus on minimizing the number of gaps in resulting scaffolds by incorporating an OLC step to resolve junctions between linked contigs. We tested the performance of AnVIL on three published and simulated datasets and compared to the previously published tools ARCS and ARKS. The results revealed that AnVIL performed similarly considering contiguity statistics, and the advantage of the overlapping step was revealed by fewer long and short variants in AnVIL produced scaffolds, in addition to a higher proportion of completely assembled LTR retrotransposons.

The human lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) is alternately required for the micropinocytosis of LASV. Therefore, it is of interest to understand the mechanism of action of the host LAMP1 with LASV protein during infection. The role of ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2, 3-sialyltransferase 4 (ST3GAL4) in the interaction between LASV (glycoprotein) GP-C and the human LAMP1 is relevant in this context. Deposited curated protein sequences of both LAMP1 and LASV GP-C were retrieved for the study. The ST3GAL4 associated data was constructed and analyzed from weighted network analysis to infer the function annotations and molecular mediators that characterize the LASV infection. The gene network shows that glycoprotein sialylation, sialyltransferase enzymatic activities and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis are linked with the ST3GAL4 function. However, the physical interaction of FAM 213A, CD8B molecule and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 inhibitor (PCSK1N) with ST3GAL4 is intriguing in this perspective. There are eleven glycosylated asparagine sequons of the human LAMP1 but only nine were assigned a sialylated glycan cap to mediate the LASV GP-C and LAMP1 interaction having exceeded a recommended glycosylation threshold of 0.5. Therefore, the sialylated glycans of the human LAMP1 are a total of 9 and these sialylated glycans mediates the molecular recognition between LASV and LAMP1. This study therefore, predicts that there is a cellular interchange between N-linked glycosylation properties of the human LAMP1 and LASV glycoprotein, and sialylation functions of ST3GAL4 in LASV infectivity. Further studies and the clinical trial of this predictive model on the sialylated glycans of LAMP1 will facilitate the understanding of LASV micropinocytosis process in host cell.","NA"

However, testing these tools individually is tedious and success is uncertain.

Here, we present OpSeF, a Python framework for deep-learning based semantic segmentation that was developed to promote the collaboration of biomedical user with experienced image-analysts. The performance of pre-trained models can be improved by using pre-processing to make the new input data more closely resemble the data the selected models were trained on. OpSeF assists analysts with the semi-automated exploration of different pre-processing parameters. OpSeF integrates in a single framework: scikit-image, a collection of Python algorithms for image processing, and three mechanistically distinct convolutional neural network (CNN) based segmentation methods, the U-Net implementation used in Cellprofiler 3.0, StarDist, and Cellpose. The optimization of parameters used for preprocessing and selection of a suitable model for segmentation form one functional unit. Even if sufficiently good results are not achievable with this approach, OpSeF results can inform the analysts in the selection of the most promising CNN-architecture in which the biomedical user might invest the effort of manually labeling training data.

We provide two generic non-microscopy image collections to illustrate common segmentation challenges. Further datasets exemplify the segmentation of a mono-layer of fluorescent cells, fluorescent tissue, cells in which various compartments have been stained with a single dye, as well as histological sections stained with one or two dyes. We provide Jupyter notebooks to support analysts in user training and as a template for the systematic search for the best combination of preprocessing and CNN-based segmentation. Results can be analyzed and visualized using matplotlib, pandas, scikit-image, and scikit-learn. They can be refined by object-selection based on their region properties, a biomedical-user-provided or an auto-generated mask. Additionally, results might be exported to AnnotatorJ for editing or classification in ImageJ. After refinement, the analyst can re-import results and further analyze them in OpSeF.

We encourage biomedical users to provide further image collections, analysts Jupyter notebooks, and pre-trained models. Thereby, OpSeF might soon become, both a ""model store"", in which appropriate model might be identified with reasonable effort and a valuable resource for teaching biomedical user CNN-based segmentation.","NA"

Polymorphisms in established pigmentation-related genes have been associated with these traits and with an increased risk of malignancy. However, the functional relationship between genetic variation and disease is still unclear, with the exception of red hair colour variants in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene.

Methods and ResultsUsing a meta-GWAS of whole blood DNAm from 36 European cohorts (N=27,750; the Genetics of DNA Methylation Consortium, GoDMC), we found that 19 out of 27 pigmentation-associated SNPs distributed within 10 genes (ASIP, BNC2, IRF4, HERC2, MC1R, OCA2, SLC24A4, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TYR) were associated with 391 DNAm sites across 30 genomic regions. We selected 25 DNAm sites for further analysis.

We examined the effect of the chosen DNAm sites on pigmentation traits, sun exposure phenotypes, and skin cancer, and on gene expression in whole blood. We found an association of decreased DNAm at cg07402062 with red hair in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), and a strong positive association of DNAm at this and correlated sites with higher expression of SPIRE2. Additionally, we investigated the association of gene expression in skin with pigmentation traits and skin cancer. The expression of ASIP, FAM83C, NCOA6, CDK10, and EXOC2 was associated with hair colour, whilst that of ASIP and CDK10 also had an effect on melanoma and BCC.

ConclusionsOur results indicate that DNAm and expression of genes in the 16q24.3 and 20q11.22 regions, deserve to be further investigated as potential mediators of the relationship between genetic variants, pigmentation/sun exposure phenotypes, and some types of skin cancer.","NA"

With single cell time-series gene expression experimental data, we could assess transcription rates, RNA degradation rates, RNA life spans, RNA demands, accumulated transcription amounts, and accumulated RNA degradation amounts by this model. The model could also predict RNA levels under simulation backgrounds, such as stimuli leading to regular oscillations in RNA abundance, stable RNA levels over time being resulted from the long shortage of total RNA activity or uncontrollable transcription, and relationship between RNA levels and protein levels.

Seriousness of the viral infection can be attributed to its lethality when not treated in time and potential to cause health complications post infection. Currently there are only preventive strategies and development of vaccination is still in its infancy of research. It is therefore highly necessary to discover newer drugs and therapies for this deadly virus. In this paper we report important insights we have obtained through a computational analysis of small molecules of Neem (Azadirachta indica) against dengue viral proteins and its required proteins in human. Our study involves identification of the effect of specific small molecules of Neem on proteins of human and virus corresponding to different pathways using simulated molecular binding analyses. We report here Gedunin and Pongamol contained in naturally occurring Neem as potential drugs against the Dengue virus.

Significance StatementWe report important ligands in Neem that have potential antiviral activity against Dengue. Our selection of Neem for testing for antiviral properties has been inspired from Ayurveda. Due to unhygienic living conditions that facilitate mosquito breeding, Dengue is a major threat in developing countries causing millions of deaths. Despite the severity of the infection, no specific antiviral drug is available. The results obtained, in terms of newer potential ligands against Dengue are significant as this provides a basis for experimentally verifying and extending the same to develop a cure.We hope that this study would would spur scientific curiosity and undertaking of further elaborate experimental studies.","NA"

We used high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of New Zealand (native) and European (invasive) populations of the freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum to find that while invaders do carry over some core microbial taxa from New Zealand, most of their microbial community is distinct. This finding highlights that invasions can result in the formation of novel symbioses. We further show that the native microbiome is composed of fewer core microbes than invasive snails, suggesting that the microbiota is streamlined to essential members.

Recently, such communication was also described in bacteriophages. Upon infection of a host cell, temperate phages of the Bacillus subtilis-infecting SPbeta group induce the secretion of a phage-encoded signalling peptide, which is used to inform the lysis-lysogeny decision in subsequent infections: the phages produce new virions and lyse their host cell when the signal concentration is low, but favour a latent infection strategy, lysogenising the host cell, when the signal concentration is high. Here, we present a mathematical model to study the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of such viral communication. We show that a communication strategy in which phages use the lytic cycle early in an outbreak (when susceptible host cells are abundant) but switch to the lysogenic cycle later (when susceptible cells become scarce) is favoured over a bet-hedging strategy in which cells are lysogenised with constant probability. However, such phage communication can evolve only if phage-bacteria populations are regularly perturbed away from their equilibrium state, so that acute outbreaks of phage infections in pools of susceptible cells continue to occur. Our model then predicts the selection of phages that switch infection strategy when half of the available susceptible cells have been infected.","NA"

We focus on three closely-related tetraploid species with contrasting ecological preferences, and which are sympatric on Fair Isle, a small isolated island in the British Isles. Using a common garden experiment, we show a genetic component to the morphological differences present between these species. Using whole genome sequencing and a novel k-mer approach, we demonstrate an allopolyploid origin, with sub-genome divergence of approximately 5%. Using ~2 million SNPs we show sub-genome homology across species consistent with a common origin, with very low sequence divergence characteristic of recent speciation. This genetic variation is broadly structured by species, with clear divergence of Fair Isle heathland E. micrantha, while grassland E. arctica and coastal E. foulaensis are more closely related. Overall, we show tetraploid Euphrasia is an allopolyploid system characterised by postglacial species divergence, where adaptation to novel environments may be conferred by old variants rearranged into new genetic lineages.","NA"

Amoebozoa is the eukaryotic supergroup sister to Obazoa. Even though Amoebozoa represents the closest outgroup to Obazoa, little genomic-level data and attention to gene inventories has been given to the supergroup. To examine the evolutionary history of the IMAC, we examine gene inventories of deeply sampled set of 100+ Amoebozoa taxa, including new data from several taxa. From these robust data sampled from the entire breadth of known amoebozoan clades, we show the presence of an ancestral complex of integrin adhesion proteins that predate the evolution of the Amoebozoa. Our results highlight that many of these proteins appear to have evolved earlier in eukaryote evolution than previously thought.

Indeed, this species displays a global distribution, is able to parasitize a large range of plants and can overcome plant resistance in a few generations. The mechanisms underlying this adaptability without sex remain poorly known and only low variation at the single nucleotide polymorphism level have been observed so far across different geographical isolates with distinct ranges of compatible hosts. Hence, other mechanisms than the accumulation of point mutations are probably involved in the genomic dynamics and plasticity necessary for adaptability. Transposable elements (TEs), by their repetitive nature and mobility, can passively and actively impact the genome dynamics. This is particularly expected in polyploid hybrid genomes such as the one of M. incognita. Here, we have annotated the TE content of M. incognita, analyzed the statistical properties of this TE content, and used population genomics approach to estimate the mobility of these TEs across 12 geographical isolates, presenting phenotypic variations. The TE content is more abundant in DNA transposons and the distribution of sequence identity of TE occurences to their consensuses suggest they have been at least recently active. We have identified loci in the genome where the frequencies of presence of a TE showed variations across the different isolates. Compared to the M. incognita reference genome, we detected the insertion of some TEs either within coding regions or in the upstream regulatory regions. These predicted TEs insertions might thus have a functional impact. We validated by PCR the insertion of some of these TEs, confirming TE movements probably play a role in the genome plasticity with possible functional impacts.","NA"

Despite the strong association between insect and plant species, previous studies conducted in natural systems have shown great variation in the strength of the correlation between their species richness. Such variation can be attributed to the proportion of generalist insect species (generality), though both higher and lower generality may weaken the correlation because 1) generalist insect species are less dependent on the number of plant species and 2) specialist insect species utilize only a part of the total plant species. To explore these opposing effects, we studied plant and herbivorous insect communities in semi-natural grasslands in Japan. Plant-insect interactions were evaluated in a unique way with a particular focus on the staying and herbivory behaviors of insects, which reflect their habitat use as well as host use. We fousnd that generality of insect communities negatively affected the correlation between species richness of plants and insects. However, such negative effect was significant only when the insect species richness was related with the number of plant species interacted with some insect species, instead of with that of total plant species. The results suggest that considering either of the opposing effects of insect generality is insufficient and they should be inclusively interpreted to understand the relationship between plant and insect species richness.","NA"

We presented participants with videos of an actress uttering action verbs (auditory; tagged at 61 Hz) accompanied by a gesture (visual; tagged at 68 Hz, using a projector with a 1440 Hz refresh rate). Integration ease was manipulated by auditory factors (clear/degraded speech) and visual factors (congruent/incongruent gesture). We identified MEG spectral peaks at the individual (61/68 Hz) tagging frequencies. We furthermore observed a peak at the intermodulation frequency of the auditory and visually tagged signals (fvisual - fauditory = 7 Hz), specifically when integration was easiest (i.e., when speech was clear and accompanied by a congruent gesture). This intermodulation peak is a signature of nonlinear audiovisual integration, and was strongest in left inferior frontal gyrus and left temporal regions; areas known to be involved in speech-gesture integration. The enhanced power at the intermodulation frequency thus reflects the ease of integration and demonstrates that speech-gesture information interacts in higher-order language areas.

However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms regulating these oscillations has been lagging behind, partially due to the lack of simple tools to reliably quantify these complex non-stationary features. With this challenge in mind, we have developed pyBOAT, a Python-based fully automatic stand-alone software that integrates multiple steps of non-stationary oscillatory time series analysis into an easy-to-use graphical user interface. pyBOAT implements continuous wavelet analysis which is specifically designed to reveal time- dependent features. In this work we illustrate the advantages of our tool by analyzing complex non-stationary time-series profiles. Our approach integrates data-visualization, optimized sinc-filter detrending, amplitude envelope removal and a subsequent continuous- wavelet based time-frequency analysis. Finally, using analytical considerations and numerical simulations we discuss unexpected pitfalls in commonly used smoothing and detrending operations.","NA"

However, due to the non-independence of network data and the presence of confounds, specialized statistical techniques are often needed to test hypotheses in these networks. Datastream permutations, originally developed to test the null hypothesis of random social structure, have become a popular tool for testing a wide array of null hypotheses. In particular, they have been used to test whether exogenous factors are related to network structure by interfacing these permutations with regression models.
C_LIO_LIHere, we show that these datastream permutations typically do not represent the null hypothesis of interest to researchers interfacing animal social network analysis with regression modelling, and use simulations to demonstrate the potential pitfalls of using this methodology.
C_LIO_LIOur simulations show that utilizing common datastream permutations to test the coefficients of regression models can lead to extremely high type I (false-positive) error rates (> 30%) in the presence of non-random social structure. The magnitude of this problem is primarily dependent on the degree of non-randomness within the social structure and the intensity of sampling
C_LIO_LIWe strongly recommend against utilizing datastream permutations to test regression models in animal social networks. We suggest that a potential solution may be found in regarding the problems of non-independence of network data and unreliability of observations as separate problems with distinct solutions.

Osteosarcoma is characterized by genomic chaos and heterogeneity. While inactivation of tumor suppressor p53 TP53 is nearly universal other high frequency mutations or structural variations have not been identified. Despite this genomic heterogeneity, key conserved transcriptional programs associated with survival have been identified across human, canine and induced murine osteosarcoma. The epigenomic landscape, including DNA methylation, plays a key role in establishing transcriptional programs in all cell types. The role of epigenetic dysregulation has been studied in a variety of cancers but has yet to be explored at scale in osteosarcoma. Here we examined genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in 24 human and 44 canine osteosarcoma samples identifying groups of highly correlated DNA methylation marks in human and canine osteosarcoma samples. We also link specific DNA methylation patterns to key transcriptional programs in both human and canine osteosarcoma. Building on previous work, we built a DNA methylation-based measure for the presence and abundance of various immune cell types in osteosarcoma. Finally, we determined that the underlying state of the tumor, and not changes in cell composition, were the main driver of differences in DNA methylation across the human and canine samples.

Despite this functional heterogeneity, BMSC cultures continue to be utilized for many applications due to the lack of definitive and universally accepted markers to prospectively identify and purify SSCs. Isolation of BMSCs is widely based on their adherence to tissue culture plastic; however, this method poses unique challenges when working with murine models. In particular, hematopoietic cell contamination is a significant impediment during the isolation or murine BMSCs. Several strategies to reduce hematopoietic contamination have been developed with varying levels of success. In this study, we found that up to 60% of cells isolated in standard BMSC cultures expressed the hematopoietic marker CD45. Remarkably, when cultured at a physiological oxygen tension of 1% O2, there was a 10-fold reduction in hematopoietic cells associated with a concomitant increase in PDGFR+ expressing stromal cells. This finding was due, in part, to a differential response of the two populations to low oxygen tension, or hypoxia. Specifically, in standard tissue culture conditions of 21% O2, CD45+ hematopoietic cells showed increased proliferation coupled with no observable changes in cell death when compared to their counterparts grown at 1% O2. In contrast, PDGFR+ stromal cells responded to hypoxia by increasing proliferation and exhibiting a 10-fold decrease in cell death. In summary, we describe a simple and reliable method exploiting the divergent biological response of hematopoietic and stromal cells to hypoxia to significantly increase the PDGFR+ stromal cell population in murine BMSC cultures.","NA"

MethodFluorescence lifetimes and spectra of five eyes with AMD and nine control eyes were analyzed in cryosections by means of two-photon excited fluorescence at 960 nm. Spectra were detected at 490 - 647nm. Lifetime was measured using time-correlated single photon counting in two spectral channels: 500-550nm and 550-700nm. The fluorescence decays over time were approximated by a series of three exponential functions and the amplitude-weighted mean fluorescence lifetime {tau}m was determined.

Results196 sub-RPE deposits were identified (AMD n=76, healthy n=120) and 230 RPE sites recorded. The peak emission wavelength of drusen was significantly green-shifted compared to RPE (peak at 570nm vs. 610nm), but not different between patients and controls. Drusen showed considerably longer {tau}m than RPE: (ch1: 581 {+/-} 163 ps vs. 177 {+/-} 25 ps, ch2: 541 {+/-} 125 ps vs. 285 {+/-} 31 ps, p < 0.001). Drusen found in AMD eyes had longer lifetimes than drusen of controls (ch1: 650 {+/-} 167 ps vs. 537 {+/-} 145 ps, ch2: 600 {+/-} 125 ps vs. 504 {+/-} 111 ps, p < 0.001). In addition, drusen in AMD eyes showed a more homogenous fluorescence distribution and more drusen were larger than 63{micro}m than in control eyes.

ConclusionsEx vivo fluorescence imaging of drusen in cross-sections enables the separation of their autofluorescence from that of over- or underlying structures. Our analysis showed considerable variability of drusen lifetimes but not spectra. This indicates that drusen consist of a variety of different fluorophores or expose the same fluorophores to different microenvironments. Changes in drusen lifetimes could be related to AMD progression.","NA"

This was not detected in cells from solid tissues nor in primary monocytes from healthy donors. However, lipopolysaccharide stimulated monocytes responded to targeting PCNAs scaffold function similarly to haematological cancer cells, suggesting that cellular stress is an important factor for the observed response.

Despite the tremendous burden of ASD, there are currently no disease-modifying treatments. Like many neuropsychiatric illnesses ASD has a complex pathophysiology driven by genetic and environmental factors. There is interest in identifying modifiable environmental factors as potential translational research strategies for development of therapeutics for ASD. A rapidly growing body of research demonstrates that the resident bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract, collectively the gut microbiome, have profound influence on brain and behavior. This gut-brain signaling pathway is highly relevant to ASD as the microbiome begins to form at birth, is heavily influenced by environmental factors throughout early life, and begins to stabilize at the same stage of development that symptoms of ASD begin to develop. To investigate potential gene x microbiome interactions in a model of ASD, we utilized mutant mice carrying a deletion of the ASD-associated Shank3 gene (Shank3KO), which clinically manifests as Phelan-McDermid syndrome, as a model for genetic risk of ASD. Analysis of the gut microbiome of Shank3KO mice demonstrated genotype effects on both microbiome composition and metabolite production. Behaviorally, Shank3KO mice demonstrate decreased social interactions and have altered anxiety and compulsive-like behaviors. Disruption of the microbiome with broad spectrum antibiotics lead to an exacerbation of all behavioral phenotypes in Shank3KO mice. Additionally, we found that Shank3KO mice had markedly increased changes in gene expression in the prefrontal cortex following microbiome depletion. Taken together, our results suggest a gene x microbiome interaction in this mouse model for ASD and raise the possibility that targeting the microbiome may be a valid translational research strategy in developing therapeutics for ASD.","NA"

Specifically, we looked at whether social gazing behaviour of L'Hoest's monkeys (Allochrocebus lhoesti) is sensitive to the informational state of conspecifics using an original experimental design, thereby focusing on their ability to represent conspecifics' rather than human experimenters' mental states. We presented a group of 11 zoo-housed monkeys with a box that contained either an appetitive (mealworms), aversive (raptor stuffed toy) or neutral stimulus (wood bark chips). The discoverer (the first individual that inspected the content of the box) emitted more social gazes in the aversive condition than in the neutral and appetitive conditions. Besides, social gazing was related to the informational state of the conspecifics in the appetitive and neutral conditions, with more social gazes directed towards informed individuals (who had inspected the box) rather than uninformed ones (who had not inspected the box yet). Additional examination of the behaviour of the discoverers revealed that they were likely addressing social gazes to individuals who were in close proximity to them, suggesting that they preferentially gaze at informed conspecifics because the latter remained in proximity.

Often translation arrest leads to condensation of untranslated messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) into stress granules (SGs). Studies into mechanisms of SG formation and functions are complicated because various types of stress cause formation of SGs with different properties and composition. In this work we focused on the mechanism of SG formation triggered by UV damage. We demonstrate that UV-induced inhibition of translation does not cause dissociation of the 48S preinitiation complexes. The catalytic activity of the general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase contributes to UV-induced SG formation, which is independent of the GCN2-mediated phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2. Like many other types of SGs, condensation of UV-induced granules specifically requires the Ras-GTPase-Activating Protein SH3-Domain-Binding Protein 1 (G3BP1).

Whilst bacteria encode single-domain Na+-selective voltage-gated channels (BacNav), they typically exhibit much slower kinetics than 4D-Navs, and are not thought to have crossed the prokaryote-eukaryote boundary. As such, the capacity for rapid Na+-selective signalling is considered to be confined to certain animal taxa, and absent from photosynthetic eukaryotes. Certainly, in land plants, such as the Venus Flytrap where fast electrical excitability has been described, this is most likely based on fast anion channels. Here, we report a unique class of eukaryotic Na+-selective single-domain channels (EukCatBs) that are present primarily in haptophyte algae, including the ecologically important calcifying coccolithophores. The EukCatB channels exhibit very rapid voltage-dependent activation and inactivation kinetics, and sensitivity to the highly selective 4D-Nav blocker tetrodotoxin. The results demonstrate that the capacity for rapid Na+-based signalling in eukaryotes is not restricted to animals or to the presence of 4D-Navs. The EukCatB channels therefore represent an independent evolution of fast Na+-based electrical signalling in eukaryotes that likely contribute to sophisticated cellular control mechanisms operating on very short time scales in unicellular algae.

A new method to isolate implicit adaptation involves the use of a ""clamped"" visual perturbation in which, during a reaching movement, visual feedback is limited to a cursor that follows an invariant trajectory, offset from the target by a fixed angle. Despite full awareness that the cursor movement is not contingent on their behavior, as well as explicit instructions to ignore the cursor, systematic changes in motor behavior are observed, and these changes have the signatures of implicit adaptation observed in studies using classic visuomotor perturbations. While it is clear that the response to clamped feedback occurs automatically, it remains unknown if the adjustments in behavior remain outside the participants awareness. To address this question, we used the clamp method and directly probed awareness by asking participants to report their hand position after each reach. As expected, we observed robust deviations in hand angle away from the target (average of [~]18{degrees}). The hand reports also showed systematic deviations over the course of adaptation, initially attracted towards the visual feedback and then in the opposite direction, paralleling the shift in hand position. However, these effects were subtle ([~]2{degrees} at asymptote), with the hand reports dominated by a feedforward signal associated with the motor intent yet modulated in a limited way by feedback sources. These results confirm that adaptation in response to a visual perturbation is not only automatic, but also largely implicit.

NEWS AND NOTEWORTHYSensorimotor adaptation operates in an obligatory manner. Qualitatively, subjective reports obtained after adaptation demonstrate that, in many conditions, participants are unaware of significant changes in behavior. In the present study, we quantified participants awareness of adaptation by obtaining reports of hand position on a trial-by-trial basis. The results confirm that participants are largely unaware of adaptation, but also reveal the subtle influence of feedback on their subjective experience.","NA"

Data were collected from a large sample of 217 young, healthy adult participants, including whole brain structural MRI data (0.8mm isotropic voxels) and widely-varying performance on scene imagination, autobiographical memory, future thinking and navigation tasks. We found little evidence that hippocampal grey matter volume was related to task performance. This was the case using different analysis methods (voxel-based morphometry, partial correlations), when whole brain or hippocampal regions of interest were examined, and across different sub-groups (divided by gender, task performance, self-reported ability).

The present meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies used the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method in order to determine the set of regions commonly activated in space and time processing and to establish the neural activations specific to each magnitude domain. Following PRISMA guidelines, we included in the analysis a total of 112 and 114 experiments, exploring space and time processing, respectively.

We clearly identified the presence of a system of brain regions commonly recruited in both space and time and that includes: bilateral insula, the pre-supplementary motor area (SMA), the right frontal operculum and the intraparietal sulci. These regions might be the best candidates to form the core magnitude neural system. Surprisingly, along each of these regions but the insula, ALE values progressed in a cortical gradient from time to space. The SMA exhibited an anterior-posterior gradient, with space activating more-anterior regions (i.e., pre-SMA) and time activating more-posterior regions (i.e., SMA-proper).

C.","Michael C Ashby","University of Bristol","2020-04-30",1,"cc_by","new results","neuroscience","Neurodegeneration driven by aberrant tau is a key feature of many dementias. Pathological stages of tauopathy are characterised by reduced synapse density and altered synapse function. Furthermore, changes in synaptic plasticity have been documented in the early stages of tauopathy suggesting that they may be a driver of later pathology. However, it remains unclear if synapse plasticity is specifically linked to the degeneration of neurons. This is partly because, in progressive dementias, pathology can vary widely from cell-to-cell along the prolonged disease time-course. To overcome this variability, we have taken a longitudinal experimental approach to track individual neurons through the progression of neurodegenerative tauopathy. Using repeated in vivo 2-photon imaging in rTg4510 transgenic mice, we have measured structural plasticity of presynaptic terminaux boutons and postsynaptic spines on individual axons and dendrites over long periods of time. By following individual neurons, we have measured synapse density across the neuronal population and tracked changes in synapse turnover in each neuron. We found that tauopathy drives a reduction in density of both presynaptic and postsynaptic structures and that this is partially driven by degeneration of individual axons and dendrites that are spread widely across the disease time-course. Both synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration was ameliorated by reduction in expression of the aberrant P301L transgene, but only if that reduction was initiated early in disease progression. Notably, neurite degeneration was preceded by alterations in synapse turnover that contrasted in axons and dendrites. In dendrites destined to die, there was a dramatic loss of spines in the week immediately before degeneration. In contrast, axonal degeneration was preceded by a progressive attenuation of presynaptic turnover that started many weeks before axon disappearance. Therefore, changes in synapse plasticity are harbingers of degeneration of individual neurites that occur at differing stages of tau-driven neurodegenerative disease, suggesting a cell or neurite autonomous process. Furthermore, the links between synapse plasticity and degeneration are distinct in axonal and dendritic compartments.

Although abundant evidence exists for the learning of statistical structure (specifically event probability structure) from units of sounds, little research has explored what constitutes a distinct unit of sound. Here we show that spectral content is an important cue within sound units for acquiring a stable mental representation of sound structure. Tone sequences in a novel scale were constructed and presented to participants on three different timbres with spectral cues that were either congruent with the scale structure, incongruent with the scale structure, or did not contain spectral cues (neutral). Participants completed probe tone ratings before and after a half-hour period of exposure to melodies in the artificial grammar, using timbres that were either congruent, incongruent, or neutral. Learning outcome was assessed by correlating pre/post-exposure ratings and the statistical structure of tones within the exposure period. Participants did best at learning with congruent timbres, and worst with incongruent timbres. Results show that spectral content is a useful cue for statistical learning, and suggest that the frequency structure of sounds might be acquired through exposure to spectral distribution in natural sounds.","NA"

Subgenome-specific transcriptional networks identified distinct transcription factor families enriched in each of the An and Cn subgenome early in seed development. Global gene expression profiling of laser-microdissected seed subregions further reveal subgenome expression dynamics in the embryo, endosperm, and seed coat of early stage seeds. Transcription factors predicted to be regulators encoded by the An subgenome are expressed primarily in the seed coat whereas regulators encoded by the Cn subgenome were expressed primarily in the embryo. Data suggest subgenome bias are characteristic features of the B. napus seed throughout development, and that such bias might not be universal across the embryo, endosperm, and seed coat of the developing seed. Whole genome transcription factor networks identified BZIP11 as a transcriptional regulator of early B. napus seed development. Knockdown of BZIP11 using RNA interference resulted in a similar reduction in gene activity of predicted gene targets, and a reproductive-lethal phenotype.

We show that top ranked regulators fall mainly into two  age groups; genes that appeared first in land plants and genes that emerged later in the Oryza clade. TFs predicted to be high in the ranking belong to specific gene families, have relatively simple intron/exon and protein structures, and functionally converge to regulate primary and secondary metabolism pathways.

In response to this challenge, biologists have developed a range of marking (tattoos, brands, toe-clips) and tagging (PIT, VIA, VIE) methods to identify individuals and cohorts. Animals with complex life cycles are notoriously hard to mark because of the distortion or loss of the tag across metamorphosis. In frogs, few studies have attempted larval tagging and none have been conducted on a tropical species. Here, we present the first successful account of VIE tagging in early larval stages (Gosner stage 25) of the dyeing poison frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) coupled with a novel anaesthetic (2-PHE) application for tadpoles that does not require buffering. Mean weight of individuals at time of tagging was 0.12g, which is the smallest and developmentally youngest anuran larvae tagged to date. We report 81% tag detection over the first month of development, as well as the persistence of tags across metamorphosis in this species. Cumulative tag retention versus tag observation differed by approximately 15% across larval development demonstrating that ""lost"" tags can be found later in development. Tagging had no effect on tadpole growth rate or survival.

We investigated the determinants of selective fidelity in the prototypical Bordetella bacteriophage DGR using an in vitro system that recapitulates this process. We found that the DGR reverse transcriptase bRT and associated protein Avd, along with a specific DGR RNA that contains a template region and flanking functional elements, had a markedly low catalytic efficiency across a template adenine. This was the case even for the correct base pair with an incoming TTP, in agreement with results from other low fidelity polymerases.

We find that sleep-promoting dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) neurons, effectors of homeostatic sleep in Drosophila, are presynaptic to hugin+ neurons, previously identified as circadian output neurons regulating locomotor activity rhythms. Sleep deprivation decreases hugin+ neuronal activity, which likely suppresses circadian control to promote recovery sleep driven by dFB neurons. Indeed, removal of hugin+ neurons increases sleep-promoting effects of dFB neurons. Trans-synaptic mapping reveals that hugin+ neurons feed back onto s-LNv central clock neurons, which also show Hugin-dependent decreased activity upon sleep loss.

This allows us to trace the origin of lipid-calcium selectivity in membrane fusion to the formation of lipid clusters with long-range correlations that induce negative curvature on the membrane surface. Furthermore, the clusters generate lateral tension in the headgroup region at the membrane surface, concomitantly increasing its Gaussian bending modulus. Finally, calcium binding also reduces the orientational polarization of water around the membrane headgroups, potentially reducing the hydration force acting between membranes.

In light of the influence each diet has on specific physiological attributes, we comprehensively assessed the impact of these diets on animal health and devised a blueprint for utilizing different diet combinations over the lifespan, as a nutraceutical for optimal longevity. The expansion of the bacterial diet options to use in the laboratory will provide a critical tool to better understand the complexities of gene-diet interactions for health.","NA"

However, functional similarities and differences among these proteins are largely unknown. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, UNC-87 is a calponin-related protein with seven calponin-like (CLIK) motifs and is required for maintenance of contractile apparatuses in muscle cells. Here, we report that CLIK-1, another calponin-related protein that also contains seven CLIK motifs, has an overlapping function with UNC-87 to maintain actin cytoskeletal integrity in vivo and has both common and different actin-regulatory activities in vitro. CLIK-1 is predominantly expressed in the body wall muscle and somatic gonad, where UNC-87 is also expressed. unc-87 mutation causes cytoskeletal defects in the body wall muscle and somatic gonad, whereas clik-1 depletion alone causes no detectable phenotypes. However, simultaneous depletion of clik-1 and unc-87 caused sterility due to ovulation failure by severely affecting the contractile actin networks in the myoepithelial sheath of the somatic gonad. In vitro, UNC-87 bundles actin filaments. However, CLIK-1 binds to actin filaments without bundling them and is antagonistic to UNC-87 in filament bundling. UNC-87 and CLIK-1 share common functions to inhibit cofilin binding and allow tropomyosin binding to actin filaments, suggesting that both proteins stabilize actin filaments. Thus, partially redundant functions of UNC-87 and CLIK-1 in ovulation is likely mediated by their common actin-regulatory activities, but their distinct activities in actin bundling suggest that they also have different biological functions.","NA"

The goal of the present study was to describe day-roosting habitats and patterns of thermoregulation in two bat species occurring on Tierra del Fuego, Myotis chiloensis (Chilean myotis) and Histiotus magellanicus (southern big-eared brown bat), during late spring. To do so, we tagged 17 bats with temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters, located 17 day-roosts, and collected 81 days of skin temperature data. We concurrently recorded ambient air temperature to determine its effect on torpor use. Both species were found roosting in large diameter (77.8 {+/-} 6 cm), typically live, Nothofagus pumilio trees (lenga) located on the edges of forest gaps or within stands primarily composed of smaller, younger trees. Bats of both species frequently used torpor, with skin temperatures dropping below a torpor threshold on 89% of days (n = 72) and daily minimum skin temperatures averaging 16.5 {degrees}C over the course of our study. Average daily air temperature was a significant predictor of torpor use, with lower skin temperatures and more time spent in torpor observed on colder days. Minimum skin temperature and time spent torpid did not vary between bat species, nor did the characteristics of day-roosts. These data show that spring temperatures in Tierra del Fuego pose an energetic challenge that bats meet through frequent use of torpor, and likely, habitat selection. We recommend local conservation efforts keep these thermal challenges in mind by retaining large trees, which may provide warmer microclimates or room for social groups.","NA"

To empirically assess the relative performance of these technologies for different applications, we performed low-pass sequencing (targeting coverage levels of 0.5x and 1x) and array genotyping (using the Illumina Global Screening Array) on 120 DNA samples derived from African and European-ancestry individuals that are part of the 1000 Genomes Project. We then imputed both the sequencing data and the genotyping array data to the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 haplotype reference panel using a leave-one-out design. First, we evaluated overall imputation accuracy from these different assays as measured by genotype concordance; we introduce the concept of effective coverage that accounts for evenness of sequencing and show that this metric is a better predictor of imputation accuracy than nominal mapped coverage for low-pass sequencing data. Next, we evaluated overall power for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as measured by the squared correlation between imputed and true genotypes. In the African individuals, at common variants (> 5% minor allele frequency), imputation r2 averaged 0.83 for the array data and ranged from 0.89 to 0.95 for the low-pass sequencing data, corresponding to an effective 7 - 15% increase in GWAS discovery power. For the same variants in the European individuals, imputation r2 averaged 0.91 for the array data and ranged from 0.92-0.96 for the low-pass sequencing data, corresponding to an effective 1-6% increase in GWAS discovery power. Finally, we computed polygenic risk scores for breast cancer and coronary artery disease from the different assays. We observed consistently lower measurement error for risk scores computed from low-pass sequencing data above an effective coverage of ~ 0.5x. The mean squared error of the array-based estimates was three to four times that of the estimates from samples sequenced at an effective coverage of ~ 1.2x for coronary artery disease, with qualitatively similar results for breast cancer. We conclude that low-pass sequencing plus imputation, in addition to providing a substantial increase in statistical power for genome wide association studies, provides increased accuracy for polygenic risk prediction at effective coverages of ~ 0.5x and higher.","NA"

Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and define cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives. With the imperfect tests that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of seroprevalence and is usually corrected post-hoc to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we introduce a likelihood-based inference method for the estimation of the seroprevalence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. The likelihood-based method outperforms the methods based on cutoffs and post-hoc corrections leading to less variation in point-estimates of the seroprevalence and its temporal trend. We show how the likelihood-based method can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the tests ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the seroprevalence. An R-package with the likelihood and power analysis functions is provided. Our study opens an avenue to using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods with post-hoc correction at exactly the low seroprevalence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in COVID-19 serosurveys.","NA"

Like reinforcement learning, risk preferences are modulated by dopamine: enhanced dopamine levels induce risk-seeking. Learning and risk preferences have so far been studied independently, even though it is commonly assumed that they are (partly) regulated by the same neurotransmitter. Here, we use a novel learning task to look for prediction-error induced risk-seeking in human behavior and pupil responses.

SMA patients are more susceptible to dyslipidemia as well as liver steatosis, features reproduced in SMA mouse models. As current pre-clinical models of NAFLD are invariably imperfect and generally take a long time to develop, the rapid development of liver steatosis in SMA mice provides a means to identify molecular markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, we investigated whether Smn2B/- mice, a model of severe SMA, display typical features of NAFLD/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

MethodsBiochemical, histological, electron microscopy, proteomic, and high-resolution respirometry were used.

ResultsThe Smn2B/- mice develop steatohepatitis early in life. The consequent liver damage arises from mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and results in impaired hepatic function including alterations in protein output, complement, coagulation, iron homeostasis, and IGF-1 metabolism. The steatohepatitis is reversible by AAV9-SMN gene therapy. The NAFLD phenotype is likely due to non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) overload from peripheral lipolysis, subsequent to hyperglucagonemia compounded by reduced muscle use. Mitochondrial {beta}-oxidation contributed to hepatic damage as we observed enhanced hepatic mitochondrial {beta}-oxidation and reactive oxygen species production. Hepatic mitochondrial content, however, was decreased. In contrast to typical NAFLD/NASH, the Smn2B/- mice lose weight due to their neurological condition, develop hypoglycemia and do not develop hepatic fibrosis.

ConclusionThe Smn2B/- mice represent a good model of microvesicular steatohepatitis. Like other models, it is not representative of the complete NAFLD/NASH spectrum. Nevertheless, it offers a reliable, low-cost, early onset model that is not dependent on diet to identify molecular players in NAFLD pathogenesis and can serve as one of the very few models of microvesicular steatohepatitis for both adult and pediatric populations.","NA"

Fungal THI4s are suicide enzymes that destroy an essential active-site Cys residue to obtain the sulfur atom needed for thiazole formation. In contrast, certain prokaryotic THI4s have no active-site Cys, use sulfide as sulfur donor, and are truly catalytic. The presence of a conserved active-site Cys in plant THI4s and other indirect evidence implies that they are suicidal. To confirm this, we complemented the Arabidopsis tz-1 mutant, which lacks THI4 activity, with a His-tagged Arabidopsis THI4 construct. LC-MS analysis of tryptic peptides of the THI4 extracted from leaves showed that the active-site Cys was predominantly in desulfurated form, consistent with THI4 having a suicide mech-anism in planta. Unexpectedly, transcriptome datamining and deep proteome profiling showed that barley, wheat, and oat have both a widely expressed canonical THI4 with an active-site Cys, and a THI4-like paralog (non-Cys THI4) that has no active-site Cys and is the major type of THI4 in devel-oping grains. Transcriptomic evidence also indicated that barley, wheat, and oat grains synthesize thiamin de novo, implying that their non-Cys THI4s synthesize thiazole. Structure modeling supported this inference, as did demonstration that non-Cys THI4s have significant capacity to complement thia-zole auxotrophy in Escherichia coli. There is thus a prima facie case that non-Cys cereal THI4s, like their prokaryotic counterparts, are catalytic thiazole synthases. Bioenergetic calculations show that, relative to suicide THI4s, such enzymes could save substantial energy during the grain filling period.

Quenching of BSA fluorescence by LT4 combined with UV-Vis spectroscopy shows a ground-state complex formation that may be accompanied by a nonradiative energy transfer process. FT-IR revealed the changes induced by LT4 in the secondary structure of BSA molecules, due to the partial unfolding of BSA native structure upon LT4 binding. Scatchard approach allowed the determination of the binding constant Kb (5.12 x 106 M-1) and the equilibrium dissociation constant Kd (19.5 x 10-6 M) which suggest a moderate binding, as well as the thermodynamic parameters, which correspond to an enthalpic process (-51.99 kJ mol-1), driven mainly by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. Using SPR, first, the confinement of BSA onto the chip gold surface was optimized towards LT4 binding. Second, the binding affinity of LT4 with BSA was characterized using the Hill-Langmuir equation, which led to a moderate binding affinity (apparent Kd = 67.6 x 10-6 M). As preliminary results, both fluorescence quenching and SPR can be used as a stepping stone for the development of a spectroscopic biosensor for LT4 detection, with a limit of detection as low as 0.23 x 10-6 M.

SIGNIFICANCEMost cellular and tissue functions are influenced by thyroid hormones, such as thyroxine (T4). Thus, these hormones influence the metabolism of various biomolecules and are related to a wide variety of medical conditions, of which, the best therapy is the hormone replacement using LT4 medicine. Therefore, the monitoring LT4 levels in the human body while undergoing LT4 treatment is of particular importance. Here we investigated the binding mechanism and affinity between LT4 and bovine serum albumin (BSA), one of the transporter proteins, by spectroscopic (UV-Vis, FTIR, fluorescence) and optical (SPR) methods. Although LT4-BSA binding was driven mainly by hydrogen and van der Waals bonds with moderate affinity, we found that fluorescence can be used for LT4 detection in nanomolar range.","NA"

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, ferrets and a person strikingly dysregulates the NAD gene set by inducing a set of PARP family members that includes enzymes required for the innate immune response to CoVs. CoV infection also induces a severe attack on host cell NAD. Overexpression of one induced enzyme, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host NAD.

Single cell RNA-seq from 65 studies shows significant overlap between the expression of ENaC- and ACE2, the putative receptor for the virus, in cell types linked to the cardiovascular-renal-pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Triangulating this cellular fingerprint with amino acid cleavage signatures of 178 human proteases shows the potential for tissue-specific proteolytic degeneracy wired into the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. We extrapolate that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global coronavirus pandemic may be in part due to its targeted mimicry of human ENaC and hijack of the associated host proteolytic network.","NA"

Eukaryotes lack pathways to synthesize queuine , the nucleobase precursor to queuosine, and must obtain it from diet or gut microbiota. Here we describe the effects of queuine on the physiology of the eukaryotic parasite, Entamoeba histolytica , the causative agent of amebic dysentery. Queuine is efficiently incorporated into E. histolytica tRNAs by a tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (EhTGT) and this incorporation stimulates the methylation of C 38 in tRNA Asp GTC . Queuine protects the parasite against oxidative stress (OS) and antagonizes the negative effect that oxidation has on translation by inducing the expression of genes involved in OS response, such as heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70), antioxidant enzymes, and enzymes involved in DNA repair. On the other hand, queuine impairs E. histolytica virulence by downregulating the expression of genes previously associated with virulence, including cysteine proteases, cytoskeletal proteins, and small GTPases. Silencing of EhTGT prevents incorporation of queuine into tRNAs and strongly impairs methylation of C 38 in tRNA Asp GTC , parasite growth, resistance to OS, and cytopathic activity. Overall, our data reveal that queuine plays a dual role in promoting OS resistance and reducing parasite virulence.","NA"

The aims of the present study were to analyze the molecular epidemiology of mumps viruses in the Netherlands in 2017-2019 and to elucidate whether complete genome sequencing adds to the molecular resolution of mumps viruses when compared to sequencing of the mumps SH gene and non-coding regions (SH+NCRs). To this end, Sanger sequence data from the SH+NCRs were analyzed from 82 mumps genotype G viruses. In addition, the complete genomes were obtained from 10 mumps virus isolates using next-generation sequencing. Analysis of SH+NCRs of mumps viruses revealed the presence of two major lineages in the Netherlands, which was confirmed by analysis of complete genomes. Comparison of molecular resolution obtained with SH+NCRs and complete genomes clearly indicated that additional molecular resolution can be obtained by analyzing complete genomes. In conclusion, analysis of SH + NCRs sequence data from recent mumps genotype G viruses indicate that mumps viruses continue to circulate in the Netherlands and surrounding countries. However, to understand exact transmission trees and to compare mumps viruses on a large geographic scale, analysis of complete genomes is a very useful approach.","NA"

YTHDF2 has been reported to recognize and mediate the m6A-containing transcripts decay during the mouse oocyte mature, embryonic stem cell differentiation, neural development, and zebrafish maternal-to-zygotic transition. However, the roles of YTHDF2 in mammalian spermatogenesis are uncertain. Here, we generated germ cell-specific Ythdf2 mutants (Ythdf2-vKO) at a C57BL/6J background, and demonstrated that YTHDF2 was essential for mouse spermatogenesis and fertility. Ythdf2-vKO provided oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) phenotype with increased apoptosis in germ cells. High-throughput RNA-seq of the testis tissue showed the failure of the degradation of a wave of YTHDF2 target mRNA. Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis combined with our previous single-cell transcriptomics data of mouse spermatogenesis pointed out the failure of a wave of transcript transition during the spermatogenesis of Ythdf2-vKO, which was confirmed by gene expression analysis of diplotene spermatocytes and round spermatids obtained through fluorescence-activated cell sorting using qPCR. Our study demonstrates the fundamental role of YTHDF2 during mouse spermatogenesis and provides a potential candidate for the diagnosis of male infertility with OAT syndrome.

Author summaryMale infertility is becoming a worldwide health problem. Male gamete is generated through spermatogenesis, which is a complicated developmental process with dynamic transcriptome changes. RNA m6A modification has been reported as the most prominently internal mRNA modification, which control the tune of gene expression through mRNA splicing, export, translation and decay. RNA m6A modification is catalyzed by ""writers"", and could be removed by ""erasers"". The m6A modification enzymes are reported to play important roles during spermatogenesis. Given that the biological function of m6A modification are mediated through its ""readers"", its readers might be proposed to be involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis. YTHDF2, as a reader of m6A modification, has been reported to mediate the m6A-containing transcripts decay. To explore the roles of YTHDF2 in spermatogenesis, we used germ cell-specific mutation strategy to knock out the mouse Ythdf2. The mutants provided oligoasthenoteratozoospermia phenotype. Our study demonstrate that YTHDF2 is essential for mouse spermatogenesis. YTHDF2 could be a potential candidate for the diagnosis of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia syndrome.","NA"

Here, we report an epitope grafting mutational analysis of the serospecificity and cross-serospecificity of the envelope protein domain 3 (ED3; 107 residues, [~]11.6kDa), which contains two major putative epitopes of DENVs. To this end, we constructed ED3 from DENV3 (3ED3) and DENV4 (4ED3), and six epitope-grafted variants, where we transferred epitope 1 (L304I, K305D, V309M, and S310A) and/or epitope 2 (D383N, K384S, K387T, and N389H) of 4ED3 onto 3ED3 and vice versa. Mice immunization using 3ED3 and 4ED3 generated serotype-specific antisera, as expected. Similarly, most epitope-grafted ED3s produced antisera serospecific to the template ED3 with little or no cross-recognition of ED3 of the serotype from which the epitopes were taken. This result indicated that a mere grafting of the epitope was not sufficient to transfer serospecificity, contrary to our expectations. However, one epitope grafted ED3 mutant, where epitope 1 of 3ED3 was grafted onto 4ED3 (4ED3epi1), generated antisera that was serospecific to both 4ED3 and 3ED3. The 4ED3epi1 is thus a chimeric ED3 that produces antisera possessing serospecificity to both 3ED3 and 4ED3. The 4ED3epi1 provides a unique tool for analyzing serospecificity and cross-reactivity in dengue, and we hope it will serve as a template for trivalent and eventually tetravalent antisera.","NA"

We found that parasitized plants had smaller crowns and branch growth, and suffered lower mortality compared to non-parasitized plants. Parasitism by S. flexicaulis decreased dominance and increased the diversity and evenness of plants in the community over time. Parasitism leads to competition with the host for water and nutrients, which may decrease the performance of the host and, consequently, leading to host death. The high mortality of the most abundant plant species led to a restructured woody plant community. These results reinforce the importance of parasitic plants as key species for maintaining species diversity in plant communities.","NA"

In differentiated cells of the epidermis, they are organized by desmosomes, cell-cell adhesion complexes which provide essential mechanical integrity to this tissue. Despite this, we know little about how keratin organization is controlled and whether desmosomes actively promote keratin assembly in addition to binding pre-assembled filaments. We recently discovered that Ndel1 is a desmosome-associated protein in differentiated epidermis. Here, we show that Ndel1 binds directly to keratin subunits through a motif conserved in all intermediate filament proteins. Further, Ndel1 is necessary for robust desmosome-keratin association and sufficient to reorganize keratins to distinct cellular sites. Lis1, a Ndel1 binding protein, is required for desmosomal localization of Ndel1, but not for its effects on keratin filaments. Finally, we use mouse genetics to demonstrate that loss of Ndel1 results in desmosome defects in the epidermis. Our data thus identify Ndel1 as a desmosome-associated protein which promotes local assembly/organization of keratin filaments and is essential for both robust cell adhesion and epidermal barrier function.","NA"

Here, we identify a critical requirement of B-plexin transmembrane receptors in the response to crowding-induced mechanical forces during embryonic skin development. Epidermal stem cells lacking B-plexins fail to sense mechanical compression, resulting in disinhibition of the transcriptional coactivator YAP, hyperproliferation, and tissue overgrowth. Mechanistically, we show that B-plexins mediate mechanoresponses to crowding through stabilization of adhesive cell junctions and lowering of cortical stiffness. Finally, we provide evidence that the B-plexin-dependent mechanochemical feedback is also pathophysiologically relevant to limit tumor growth in basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer. Our data uncover a central role of B-plexins in mechanosensation to couple cell density and cell division in development and disease.","NA"

Expression and aggregation of HSATII RNA in cancer cells is concomitant with recruitment of key chromatin regulatory proteins including methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). While HSATII expression has been observed in a wide variety of cancer cell lines and tissues, the effect of its expression is unknown. We tested the effect of stable expression of HSATII RNA within cells that do not normally express HSATII. Ectopic HSATII expression in HeLa and primary fibroblast cells leads to focal accumulation of HSATII RNA in cis and triggers the accumulation of MeCP2 onto nuclear HSATII RNA bodies. Further, long-term expression of HSATII RNA leads to cell division defects including lagging chromosomes, chromatin bridges, and other chromatin defects. Thus, expression of HSATII RNA in normal cells phenocopies its nuclear accumulation in cancer cells and allows for the characterization of the cellular events triggered by aberrant expression of pericentric satellite RNA.","NA"

Immuno-electron microscopy (EM) of synaptosomes reveals that -synuclein relocalizes from SVs to the synaptic membrane upon stimulation, allowing -synuclein to function there during or after stimulation. Using membrane recruitment assays, we show that -synuclein is co-localized with clathrin patches. We also observe that recruitment of clathrin and its adaptor, AP180, to synaptic membranes is altered in the absence of synucleins. Visualizing clathrin assembly on membranes in an in vitro reconstitution system reveal that synucleins increase clathrin patch size and curvature, facilitating clathrin coated pit maturation during the early steps of SVE.

Complex microbial communities derived from those used to treat SCN- contaminated water were exposed to systematically increased input SCN concentrations in molasses-amended and -unamended reactors and in reactors switched to unamended conditions after establishing the active SCN- degrading consortium. Five experiments were conducted over 790 days and genome-resolved metagenomics was used to resolve community composition at the strain level. A single Thiobacillus strain proliferated in all reactors at high loadings. Despite the presence of many Rhizobiales strains, a single Afipia variant dominated the molasses-free reactor at moderately high loadings. This strain is predicted to breakdown SCN- using a novel thiocyanate dehydrogenase, oxidize resulting reduced sulfur, degrade product cyanate (OCN-) to ammonia and CO2 via cyanase, and fix CO2 via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Removal of molasses from input feed solutions reproducibly led to dominance of this strain. Neither this Afipia strain nor the thiobacilli have the capacity to produce cobalamin, a function detected in low abundance community members. Although sustained by autotrophy, reactors without molasses did not stably degrade SCN- at high loading rates, perhaps due to loss of biofilm-associated niche diversity.

Secondly, we examine inter-individual correlates of these measures with: 1) task performance assessed from the same data series, 2) meta-cognitive ratings of on-taskness from thought probes occasionally presented throughout the task, and 3) self-assessed traits commonly assumed to relate to attention or sensorimotor control (ADHD tendencies, mind wandering, and impulsivity). Autocorrelation at lag 1 and Power Spectra Density slope showed high repeatability and good correlations with task performance. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis slope showed the same pattern, but less reliably. The long-term component (d) of the ARFIMA(1,d,1) model shows poor repeatability and no correlation to performance. None of these measures showed external validity when correlated to either mean subjective attentional state or self-assessed traits between participants. In sum, some measures of serial dependencies may be stable individual traits, but their usefulness to study individual differences in other constructs typically associated with variability in performance remains elusive.","NA"

To de-convolute the role of each of these mechanisms in vivo, we have made a mouse with the second mechanism disabled. The SNAP25{Delta}3 mutation renders the SNARE complex deficient in binding to G{beta}{gamma} and was used to investigate the importance of the G{beta}{gamma}-SNAP25 interaction in glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and global metabolic homeostasis. GSIS and 2A adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition of GSIS were not altered in SNAP25{Delta}3/{Delta}3 mice. Nevertheless, SNAP25{Delta}3/{Delta}3 mice exhibited a marked improvement in insulin sensitivity and were resistant to weight gain when challenged with a high fat diet (HFD). Reduced food consumption in the early stages of HFD feeding were partly responsible for the inability of SNAP25{Delta}3/{Delta}3 mice to gain weight on HFD. Additionally, improved insulin-mediated glucose uptake into white adipose tissue and increased  browning were observed in SNAP25{Delta}3/{Delta}3 mice, which is consistent with an impaired ability to retain energy stores. These phenotypic changes in SNAP25{Delta}3/{Delta}3 mice are all metabolically protective, indicating that pharmacological targeting of the G{beta}{gamma}-SNAP25 interaction may have a metabolic benefit.","NA"

Here, we addressed this question by studying the role of the MT depolymerase, MCAK, in the highly persistent migration of RPE-1 cells. MCAK knockdown leads to slowed migration and poor directional movement. Fixed and live cell imaging revealed that MCAK knockdown results in excessive membrane ruffling as well as defects in cell polarization and the maintenance of a major protrusive front. Additionally, loss of MCAK increases the lifetime of focal adhesions by decreasing their disassembly rate. These defects are due in part to the loss of the spatial distribution of MCAK activity, wherein activity is higher in the trailing edge of cells compared to the leading edge. Overexpression of Rac1 has a dominant effect over MCAK activity, placing it downstream or in a parallel pathway to MCAK function in migration. Together, our data support a model that places MCAK at a key nexus of a feedback loop, in which polarized distribution of MCAK activity and subsequent differential regulation of MT dynamics contributes to cell polarity and directional migration.","NA"

Participants then returned at Pre-adolescence ([~]6 years later) for an assessment with a structured clinical interview (internalizing/externalizing symptoms) and a magnetic resonance imaging scan. When only preschool age irritability was considered, this was a transdiagnostic predictor of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. However, a model including both preschool and school age irritability provided a more nuanced picture. A high preschool and decreasing school age profile of irritability predicted elevated pre-adolescence internalizing symptoms, potentially reflecting emerging coping/internalizing behavior in pre-adolescence. In contrast, a stable irritability profile across these timepoints predicted increased pre-adolescence externalizing symptoms. Further, preschool irritability (a period of rapid growth) did not predict pre-adolescent gray matter volume abnormality, an indicator of transdiagnostic clinical risk. However, irritability at school age (when gray matter volume growth is largely finished) demonstrated an interactive effect among regions; increased school age irritability predicted reduced volume in pre-adolescence emotional regions (e.g., amygdala, medial orbitofrontal cortex) and increased volume in other regions (e.g., cerebellum).

Mutations within the SRY gene are associated with a male-to-female sex reversal syndrome in humans and other mammalian species such as mice and rabbits. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. To understand the biological function of the SRY gene, a site-directed mutational analysis is required to investigate associated phenotypic changes at the molecular, cellular and morphological level. In our study, we successfully generated a knockout of the porcine SRY gene by microinjection of two clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) - associated protein - 9 nuclease (Cas9) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes targeting the centrally located ""high mobility group"" (HMG) domain of the SRY gene. Mutations within this region resulted in the development of complete external and internal female genitalia in genetically male pigs. The internal female genitalia including uteri, ovaries, and oviducts, revealed substantial size differences in 9-months old SRY-knockout pigs compared to age-matched female wild type controls. In contrast, a deletion within the 5 flanking region of the HMG domain was not associated with sex reversal. Results of this study demonstrates for the first time the central role of the HMG domain of the SRY gene in male sex determination in pigs. Moreover, quantitative analysis by digital PCR revealed evidence for a duplication of the porcine SRY locus. Our results pave the way towards the generation of boars exclusively producing phenotypically female offspring to avoid surgical castration without anesthesia in piglets. Moreover, the study establishes a large animal model that is much more similar to humans in regard of physiology and anatomy and pivotal for longitudinal studies.","NA"

While the reasons are unclear, relevant factors include the intensity of within-versus between-group selection that are likely to have shaped the course of life cycle evolution. A highly structured environment eliminates the possibility of mixing between evolving lineages, thus ensuring strong competition between groups. Less structure intensifies competition within groups, decreasing opportunity for group-level evolution. Here, using populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, we report the results of experiments that explore the effect of lineage mixing on the evolution of nascent multicellular groups. Groups were propagated under regimes requiring reproduction via a life cycle replete with developmental and dispersal (propagule) phases, but in one treatment lineages never mixed, whereas in a second treatment, cells from different lineages experienced intense competition during the dispersal phase. The latter treatment favoured traits promoting cell growth at the expense of traits underlying group fitness - a finding that is supported by results from a mathematical model. Together our results show that the transition to multicellularity benefits from ecological conditions that maintain discreteness not just of the group (soma) phase, but also of the dispersal (germline) phase.","NA"

Infant airway microbiota occupying the nasopharynx have been associated with respiratory disease risk and severity. The extent to which interactions between RSV and microbiota occur in the airway, and their impact on respiratory disease severity and infection susceptibility, are not well understood.

ObjectivesTo characterize associations between the nasal microbiota and RSV infection before, during, and after infants first respiratory illness.

MethodsNasal 16S rRNA microbial community profiling of two cohorts of infants in the first year of life: 1) a cross-sectional cohort of 89 RSV infected infants sampled during illness and 102 population matched healthy controls, and 2) an individually matched longitudinal cohort of 12 infants who developed RSV infection and 12 who did not, sampled at time points before, during, and after infection.

Measurements and Main ResultsWe identified 12 taxa significantly associated with RSV infection. All 12 were differentially abundant during infection, with seven differentially abundant prior to infection, and eight differentially abundant after infection. Eight of these taxa were associated with disease severity. Nasal microbiota composition was more discriminative of healthy vs. infected than of disease severity.

ConclusionsOur findings elucidate the chronology of nasal microbiota dysbiosis and suggest an altered developmental trajectory associated with first-time RSV infection. Microbial temporal dynamics reveal indicators of disease risk, correlates of illness and severity, and the impact of RSV infection on microbiota composition. Identified taxa represent appealing targets for additional translationally-oriented research.","NA"

Rgg2 and Rgg3 function is regulated by their interaction with oligopeptide quorum-sensing signals called short hydrophobic peptides (SHPs). The molecular basis of Rgg-SHP and Rgg-target DNA promoter specificity was unknown. To close this gap, we determined the cryo-EM structure of Streptococcus thermophilus Rgg3 bound to its quorum-sensing signal, SHP3, and the X-ray crystal structure of Rgg3 alone. Comparison of these structures to that of an Rgg in complex with cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of SHP-induced Rgg activity, reveals the molecular basis of CsA function. Furthermore, to determine how Rgg proteins recognize DNA promoters, we determined X-ray crystal structures of both S. dysgalactiae Rgg2 and S. thermophilus Rgg3 in complex with their target DNA promoters. The physiological importance of the observed Rgg-DNA interactions was dissected using in vivo genetic experiments and in vitro biochemical assays. Based on these structure-function studies, we present a revised unifying model of Rgg regulatory interplay. In contrast to existing models, where Rgg2 proteins are transcriptional activators and Rgg3 proteins are transcriptional repressors, we propose that both are capable of transcriptional activation. However, when Rgg proteins with different activation requirements compete for the same DNA promoters, those with more stringent activation requirements function as repressors by blocking promoter access of the SHP-bound conformationally active Rgg proteins. While a similar gene expression regulatory scenario has not been previously described, in all likelihood it is not unique to streptococci.

Significance StatementSecreted peptide pheromones regulate critical biological processes in Gram-positive bacteria. In streptococci such as the human pathogen S. pyogenes, oligopeptide pheromones, like the short hydrophobic peptides (SHPs), regulate virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and biofilm formation. SHPs directly regulate the activity of transcription factors called Rgg2 and Rgg3. We present the cryo-EM structure of Rgg3 in complex with SHP3, as well as X-ray crystal structures of Rgg2 bound to target promoter DNA, Rgg3 bound to target promoter DNA, and Rgg3 alone. Based on the cryo-EM, X-ray crystallographic, biochemical, and genetic studies presented here, we provide not only detailed mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of Rgg3-SHP3, Rgg2-DNA, and Rgg3-DNA binding specificity, but also a new model of transcription factor regulatory interplay.","NA"

Besides offering deeper insights into the ecology, evolution, and the mobilome of the cryptic members of the oral microbiome, our study reveals an intriguing resemblance between dental plaque and non-host environments indicated by the TM7 evolution, suggesting that plaque may have served as a stepping stone for environmental microbes to adapt to host environments for some clades of human associated microbes.

The BOLD response follows neuronal activity, when changes in the relative concentration of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin cause fluctuations in the MRI T2* signal. Since the BOLD signal detects changes in relative concentrations of oxy/deoxy-haemoglobin, individual differences in haemoglobin levels may influence the BOLD signal-to-noise ratio in a manner independent of the degree of neural activity. In this study, we examined whether group differences in haemoglobin may confound measures of functional connectivity. We investigated whether relationships between measures of functional connectivity and cognitive performance could be influenced by individual variability in haemoglobin. Finally, we mapped the neuroanatomical distribution of the influence of haemoglobin on functional connectivity to determine where group differences in functional connectivity are manifest.

In a cohort of 518 healthy elderly subjects (259 men) each sex group was median split into two groups with high and low haemoglobin concentration. Significant differences were obtained in functional connectivity between the high and low haemoglobin groups for both men and women (Cohens d 0.17 and 0.03 for men and women respectively). The haemoglobin connectome in males showed a widespread systematic increase in functional connectivity correlational scores, whilst the female connectome showed predominantly parietal and subcortical increases and temporo-parietal decreases. Despite the haemoglobin groups having no differences in cognitive measures, significant differences in the linear relationships between cognitive performance and functional connectivity were obtained for all 5 cognitive tests in males, and 4 out of 5 tests in females.

Our findings confirm that individual variability in haemoglobin levels that give rise to group differences are an important confounding variable in BOLD-fMRI-based studies of functional connectivity. Controlling for haemoglobin variability as a potentially confounding variable is crucial to ensure the reproducibility of human brain connectome studies, especially in studies that compare groups of individuals, compare sexes, or examine connectivity-cognition relationships.

We compiled 53,609 floral visitation records in 159 communities around the world and classified the plants floral symmetry. Globally and within individual communities, plant species with zygomorphic flowers are indeed visited by fewer pollinator species.

E. faecalis also colonizes the female reproductive tract and reports suggest vaginal colonization increases following antibiotic treatment or in patients with aerobic vaginitis. Currently, little is known about specific factors that promote E. faecalis vaginal colonization and subsequent infection. We developed a mouse model of E. faecalis vaginal carriage and demonstrate that both vancomycin resistant and sensitive strains colonize the murine vaginal tract. Following vaginal colonization, we observed E. faecalis in vaginal, cervical and uterine tissue. A mutant lacking endocarditis- and biofilm-associated pili (Ebp) exhibited a decreased ability to associate with human vaginal and cervical cells in vitro as well as ascend to the cervix and uterus in vivo. To further identify novel factors that promote vaginal colonization, we screened a low-complexity transposon (Tn) mutant library to identify genes important for E. faecalis persistence in the vaginal tract. This screen revealed 383 mutants that were underrepresented during vaginal colonization at all time points compared to growth in culture medium. We confirmed that mutants deficient in ethanolamine catabolism and the type VII secretion system were attenuated in persisting during vaginal colonization. These results reveal the complex nature of vaginal colonization and suggest that multiple factors contribute to E. faecalis persistence in the reproductive tract.

IMPORTANCEDespite increasing prevalence and association of E. faecalis with aerobic vaginitis, essentially nothing is known about the bacterial factors that influence E. faecalis vaginal colonization. We have established an animal model of vaginal colonization that supports colonization of multiple E. faecalis strains.

Identification of factors important for vaginal colonization and persistence provides potential targets for the development of therapeutics.
